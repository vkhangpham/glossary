          "content": "Transformers (film series)\nTransformers is a series of science fiction action films based on the Transformers franchise.[note 1] Michael Bay directed the first five live action films: Transformers (2007), Revenge of the Fallen (2009), Dark of the Moon (2011), Age of Extinction (2014), and The Last Knight (2017),[1][2][3] and has served as a producer for subsequent films. A sixth film, Bumblebee, directed by Travis Knight, was released in 2018, while a seventh film, Rise of the Beasts, directed by Steven Caple Jr., was released in 2023.\nThe series has been distributed by Paramount Pictures, and DreamWorks Pictures. They worked on the first two films. While the Transformers film series has received negative to mixed reception, Bumblebee received positive reviews. Despite its critical reception, the Transformers film series has generally been successful at the box office, with Dark of the Moon and Age of Extinction grossing over $1 billion each; the latter was the highest-grossing film of 2014. It is the 14th-highest-grossing film series, with a total of $5.29 billion grossed over seven films to date.\nFilms\n[edit]Transformers (2007)\n[edit]For the film, producer Don Murphy was planning a G.I. Joe film adaptation, but when the U.S. launched the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, Hasbro suggested adapting the Transformers franchise instead.[4] Tom DeSanto joined Murphy because he was a fan of the series.[5] They met with comic book writer Simon Furman, and cited the Generation 1 cartoon and comics as their main influence.[4] They made the Creation Matrix their plot device, though Murphy had it renamed because of the film series The Matrix.[6] DeSanto chose to write the treatment from a human point of view to engage the audience,[7] while Murphy wanted it to have a realistic tone, reminiscent of a disaster film.[6] The treatment featured the Autobots Optimus Prime, Ironhide, Jazz, Prowl, Arcee, Ratchet, Wheeljack, and Bumblebee, and the Decepticons Megatron, Starscream, Soundwave, Ravage, Laserbeak, Rumble, Skywarp and Shockwave.[8]\nSteven Spielberg, a fan of the comics and toys,[5] signed on as executive producer in 2004. John Rogers wrote the first draft, which pitted four Autobots against four Decepticons,[9] and featured the Ark spaceship.[10] Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, fans of the cartoon,[11] were hired to rewrite the script in February 2005.[12] Spielberg suggested that \"a boy and his car\" should be the focus.[13] This appealed to Orci and Kurtzman because it conveyed themes of adulthood and responsibility, \"the things that a car represents in the United States\".[14] The characters of Sam and Mikaela were the sole point of view given in Orci and Kurtzman's first draft.[15] The Transformers had no dialogue, as the producers feared talking robots would look ridiculous. The writers felt that even if it would look silly, not having the robots speak would betray the fanbase.[11] The first draft also had a battle scene in the Grand Canyon.[16] Spielberg read each of Orci and Kurtzman's drafts and gave notes for improvement.[13] The writers remained involved throughout production, adding additional dialogue for the robots during the sound mixing (although none of this was kept in the final film, which ran fifteen minutes shorter than the initial edit).[17] Furman's The Ultimate Guide, published by Dorling Kindersley, remained as a resource to the writers throughout production.[17] Prime Directive was used as a fake working title. This was also the name of Dreamwave Productions' first Transformers comic book.[18]\nMichael Bay was asked to direct by Spielberg on July 30, 2005,[19] but he dismissed the film as a \"stupid toy movie\".[20] Nonetheless, he wanted to work with Spielberg, and gained a new respect for the mythology upon visiting Hasbro.[19] Bay considered the first draft \"too kiddie\", so he increased the military's role in the story.[19][21] The writers sought inspiration from G.I. Joe for the soldier characters, being careful not to mix the brands.[22] Because Orci and Kurtzman were concerned the film could feel like a military recruitment commercial, they chose to make the military believe nations like Iran were behind the Decepticon attack as well as making the Decepticons primarily military vehicles.[23] Bay based Lennox's struggle to get to the Pentagon phone line while struggling with an unhelpful operator from a real account he was given by a soldier when working on another film.[19]\nOrci and Kurtzman experimented with numerous robots from the franchise, ultimately selecting the characters most popular among the filmmakers to form the final cast.[5] Bay acknowledged that most of the Decepticons were selected before their names or roles were developed, as Hasbro had to start designing the toys.[24] Some of their names were changed because Bay was upset that they had been leaked.[25] Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee and Starscream were the only characters present in each version of the script.[11] Arcee was a female Transformer introduced by Orci and Kurtzman, but she was cut because they found it difficult to explain robotic gender; Bay also disliked her motorcycle form, which he found too small.[22] An early idea to have the Decepticons simultaneously strike multiple places around the world was also dropped, being used later in the film's sequels.[15]\nTransformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009)\n[edit]In September 2007, Paramount announced a late June 2009 release date for the sequel to Transformers.[26] A major hurdle that was overcome during the film's production was the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, as well as possible strikes by the Directors Guild of America and the Screen Actors Guild. Bay began creating animatics of action sequences featuring characters rejected for the 2007 film; this would allow animators to complete sequences if the Directors Guild of America went on strike in July 2008, which ultimately did not happen.[27][28] The director considered making a small project in between Transformers and its sequel, but knew \"you have your baby and you don't want someone else to take it\".[24] The film was given a $200 million budget, which was $50 million more than the 2007 film,[29] and some of the action scenes rejected for the original were written into the sequel, such as the way Optimus is reintroduced in this film.[30] Lorenzo di Bonaventura said the studio proposed filming two sequels simultaneously, but he and Bay concurred that was not the right direction for the series.[31]\nWriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman originally passed on the sequel because of a busy schedule. The studio began courting other writers in May 2007, but as they were unimpressed with their pitches, they convinced Orci and Kurtzman to return.[27] The studio also signed on Ehren Kruger, as he impressed Bay and Hasbro president Brian Goldner with his knowledge of the Transformers mythology,[32] and because he was friends with Orci and Kurtzman.[33] The writing trio were paid $8 million.[27] Screenwriting was interrupted by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, but to avoid production delays the writers spent two weeks writing a treatment, which they handed in the night before the strike began,[33] and Bay expanded the outline into a sixty-page scriptment,[34] fleshing out the action, adding more jokes,[33] as well as selecting the majority of new characters.[35] The three writers spent four months finishing the screenplay while \"locked\" in two hotel rooms by Bay: Kruger wrote in his own room and the trio would check on each other's work twice a day.[36]\nOrci described the film's theme as \"being away from home\", with the Autobots contemplating living on Earth as they cannot restore Cybertron, while Sam goes to college.[37] He wanted the focus between the robots and humans \"much more evenly balanced\",[38] \"the stakes [to] be higher\", and the science fiction elements more prominent.[39] Lorenzo di Bonaventura said that in total, there are around forty robots in the film,[29] while ILM's Scott Farrar has said there are actually sixty.[40] Orci added that he wanted to \"modulate\" the humor more,[41] and felt he managed the more \"outrageous\" jokes by balancing them with a more serious plot approach to the Transformers' mythology.[42] Bay concurred that he wanted to please fans by making the tone darker,[43] and that \"moms will think its safe enough to bring the kids back out to the movies\" despite his trademark sense of humor.[44][better source needed]\nBefore Transformers was released, producer DeSanto had \"a very cool idea\" to introduce the Dinobots,[45] while Bay was interested in an aircraft carrier, which was dropped from the 2007 film.[46] Orci claimed they did not incorporate these characters into Revenge of the Fallen because they could not think of a way to justify the Dinobots' choice of form,[37] and were unable to fit in the aircraft carrier.[47] Orci also admitted he was also dismissive of the Dinobots because he does not like dinosaurs. \"I recognize I am weird in that department\", he said,[48] but he became fonder of them during filming because of their popularity with fans.[49] He added \"I couldn't see why a Transformer would feel the need to disguise himself in front of a bunch of lizards. Movie-wise, I mean. Once the general audience is fully on board with the whole thing, maybe Dinobots in the future.\"[50] Bay said he hated the Dinobots and they had never been in consideration for being featured in the movies.[51] It is the last film in the series to be distributed by DreamWorks.\nTransformers: Dark of the Moon (2011)\n[edit]For the third film, as a preemptive measure before the release of Revenge of the Fallen, Michael Lucchi and Paramount announced on March 16, 2009, that a third film would be released in IMAX 3-D on July 1, 2011, which earned a surprised response from director Bay:\nI said I was taking off a year from Transformers. Paramount made a mistake in dating Transformers 3—they asked me on the phone—I said yes to July 1—but for 2012—whoops! Not 2011! That would mean I would have to start prep in September. No way. My brain needs a break from fighting robots.[52]\nScreenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, who had worked on the two previous Transformers films, declined to return for the third film, with Kurtzman declaring that \"the franchise is so wonderful that it deserves to be fresh, all the time. We just felt like we'd given it a lot and didn't have an insight for where to go with it next\".[53] Revenge of the Fallen's co-writer Ehren Kruger became the sole screenwriter for Dark of the Moon. Kruger had frequent meetings with Industrial Light & Magic's (ILM) CGI visual effects producers, who suggested plot points such as the scenes in Chernobyl.[54]\nOn October 1, 2009, Bay revealed that Dark of the Moon had already gone into pre-production, and its planned release was back to its originally intended date of July 1, 2011, rather than 2012.[55] Due to the revived interest in 3-D technology brought in by the success of Avatar,[56] talks between Paramount, ILM, and Bay had considered the possibility of the next Transformers film being filmed in 3-D, and testing was performed to bring the technology into Bay's work.[57] Bay originally was not much interested in the format as he felt it did not fit his \"aggressive style\" of filmmaking, but he was convinced after talks with Avatar director James Cameron,[58] who even offered the technical crew from that film. Cameron reportedly told Bay about 3-D, \"You gotta look at it as a toy, it's another fun tool to help get emotion and character and create an experience.\"[59] Bay was reluctant to film with 3-D cameras since in test he found them to be too cumbersome for his filming style, but he did not want to implement the technology in post production either since he was not pleased with the results.[60] In addition to using the 3-D Fusion camera rigs developed by Cameron's team,[59][61] Bay and the team spent nine months developing a more portable 3-D camera that could be brought into location.[58] On the day of the film's release, Shia LaBeouf announced that Dark of the Moon would be his last Transformers film.\nIn a hidden extra for the Blu-ray release of Revenge of the Fallen, Bay expressed his intention to make Transformers 3 not necessarily larger than Revenge of the Fallen, but instead deeper into the mythology, to give it more character development, and to make it darker and more emotional.[62] Having been called Transformers 3 up to that point, the film's final title was revealed to be Dark of the Moon in October 2010.[63] After Revenge of the Fallen was panned by critics, Bay acknowledged the general flaws of the script, having blamed the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike prior to the film for many problems. Bay promised to not have the \"dorky comedy\" from the last film.[64]\nTransformers: Age of Extinction (2014)\n[edit]In February 2012, producer di Bonaventura stated that a fourth film was in the works, aiming for a 2014 release, with Michael Bay to direct and produce.[65] On the same day, Paramount Pictures and Michael Bay announced a June 27, 2014 release date for a fourth film.[66] Ehren Kruger would pen the script and Steve Jablonsky would score the film, as each had for the previous film.[67][68] The film is set five years after the events in Transformers: Dark of the Moon.[69] Shia LaBeouf did not return in any future installments. Mark Wahlberg was instead cast in the lead role as new character, Cade Yeager.[70][71][72] In November 2012, casting began to search for two more leads. Isabelle Cornish, Nicola Peltz, Gabriella Wilde, and Margaret Qualley were all considered to play Cade's daughter Tessa Yeager, while Luke Grimes, Landon Liboiron, Brenton Thwaites, Jack Reynor, and Hunter Parrish were all considered to play Tessa's race-car-driving boyfriend, Shane Dyson.[73] Bay announced on his website that Reynor would portray Shane and that the fourth film would start the next installment in the overall series; the film was to be a darker sequel to Dark of the Moon and have a different feeling.[74] Peter Cullen, who voiced Optimus Prime in the films, was to reprise his role.[75] Tyrese Gibson was in talks to reprise his role as Sgt. Robert Epps from the original trilogy.[76] Glenn Morshower stated that he was contracted for two films and he was to reprise his role.[77] It was later announced that he would not return until the next film.[78] With a budget of $165 million, filming was expected to take place in London between April and November 2013—once Pain & Gain, another film that Bay was directing, had finished editing.[79][80]\nOn January 8, 2013, it was announced that Reynor was joining Wahlberg in the lead.[81] On March 26, 2013, Nicola Peltz was cast as the female lead.[82] Bay confirmed that the movie was to be in 3D.[83] Bay revealed to Collider that actor Stanley Tucci had joined the cast, and that the film would be the first feature film to be shot using smaller digital IMAX 3D cameras.[84] On May 1, 2013, actor Kelsey Grammer was cast as the lead human villain named \"Harold Attinger\".[85] On May 6, 2013, actress Sophia Myles was cast in a major supporting role.[86] That same month, Chinese actress Li Bingbing and comedian T. J. Miller joined the cast.[87][88]\nActor T.J. Miller would be playing the best friend of Wahlberg's character who is a mechanic.[89] Also revealed were two Autobots who would have the following alternate modes—a black-and-blue 2013 Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse named \"Drift\", and a green 2014 C7 Corvette Stingray concept named Crosshairs. A truck from Western Star Trucks would be Optimus Prime's new alternate mode for the movie.[90] Bumblebee's new alternate mode was revealed to be a modified vintage 1967 Chevrolet Camaro, which later transforms into a 2014 Chevrolet Camaro concept.[91] A green military vehicle (later confirmed to be Hound) and a white emergency response vehicle were also revealed.[92]\nFilming began in June 2013, in Detroit,[93] Chicago, Austin, Los Angeles, and Hong Kong. The film was released on June 27, 2014.[94]\nTransformers: The Last Knight (2017)\n[edit]In March 2015, Deadline Hollywood reported that Paramount Pictures was in talks with Akiva Goldsman to pitch new ideas for the Transformers franchise's future installments. The studio intends to do what James Cameron and 20th Century Fox have been doing in planning three Avatar sequels, and what Disney has done to revive Star Wars, with sequels and spin-offs. Paramount has wanted to have their own cinematic universe for Transformers, similar to Marvel's/Disney's Marvel Cinematic Universe (which had been one of Paramount's previous film series), and DC Comics/Warner Bros.' DC Extended Universe. Goldsman is the head of the future projects, and worked with franchise director Michael Bay, executive producer Steven Spielberg, and producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura to organize a \"writers' room\" that incubates ideas for potential Transformers films. The writers' room members include Christina Hodson, Lindsey Beer, Andrew Barrer, and Gabriel Ferrari (Ant-Man), Robert Kirkman (The Walking Dead), Art Marcum & Matt Holloway, Zak Penn (Pacific Rim Uprising), Jeff Pinkner (The Amazing Spider-Man 2), Ken Nolan, and Geneva Robertson-Dworet.[95] Kirkman left the room after just one day to undergo throat surgery.[96] In July 2015, Akiva Goldsman and Jeff Pinkner were announced as the fifth Transformers film's screenwriters.[97] However, on November 20, due to Goldsman's commitments creating a writers' room for G.I. Joe and Micronauts properties, Paramount began to negotiate with Art Marcum and Matt Holloway (Iron Man), as well as Ken Nolan (Black Hawk Down), to write the film. Lindsey Beer and Geneva Robertson-Dworet were also brought aboard for writing duties.[98]\nAfter Transformers: Age of Extinction, Bay had decided not to direct any future Transformers films. But in early January 2016, in an interview with Rolling Stone, he stated that he would return to direct the fifth film, and that it will be his last Transformers film.[99] Paramount Pictures spent $80 million on production in Michigan, in return for $21 million in state incentives, under agreements entered into before the state legislature eliminated the film office incentive program in July 2015.[100] In April 2016, Paramount hired cinematographer Jonathan Sela.[101] On May 17, Bay revealed the official title of the film to be The Last Knight on his Instagram account, where he also posted a production video showing a close-up of Optimus Prime's face with purple eyes instead of blue, and his face mostly discolored.[102] The official Twitter account showed a 19-second short video in morse code that translates to \"I'm coming for you May 31\".[103] On May 31, it was revealed that Megatron would return in the sequel.[104]\nBumblebee (2018)\n[edit]Bumblebee is a spin-off film and prequel centered on the Transformers character of the same name and set in the 1980s. The design and style of the film included both elements from the current franchise and influences from the 1980s Transformers: Generation 1 toyline.[105]\nPrincipal photography on the film began in July 2017, in Los Angeles and San Francisco, California. It was released on December 21, 2018, to positive reviews.[106] Following the film's critical success, Hasbro intends to continue and evolve the franchise similar to Bumblebee.[107]\nTransformers: Rise of the Beasts (2023)\n[edit]In March 2019, producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura announced ongoing developments for a follow-up to Bumblebee.[108][109] By January 2020, it was officially announced that a sequel to Bumblebee was in development with a script written by Joby Harold, alongside an adaptation of Transformers: Beast Wars with a script written by James Vanderbilt.[110][111][112] The film was then scheduled for release on June 24, 2022, that May,[113][112] while in November, Steven Caple Jr. was hired to serve as director on the project, which serves as both a Bumblebee sequel and Beast Wars adaptation.[114] In April 2021, Anthony Ramos was cast in one of the lead roles for the film, with Dominique Fishback in final talks to play the lead role.[115] The project was a joint-venture production between Hasbro, eOne, and Paramount Pictures.[116]\nPrincipal photography began in June 2021, with the official title announced as Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, confirmed to be set after the events of Bumblebee.[117] Rise of the Beasts was originally scheduled for release in June 2022,[118] but was delayed until June 9, 2023.[119]\nFuture\n[edit]- Untitled The Last Knight sequel: Originally announced during the ongoing plans for a \"Transformers Cinematic Universe\" with a scheduled release date of June 28, 2019; the film was removed from Paramount's release schedule following the negative reception to The Last Knight.[120] By March 2019, producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura confirmed that a script was being written for sequels to both The Last Knight and Bumblebee.[108] It was later confirmed that the film will not be a direct sequel to the previous installment.[121] In an interview in September 2021, when asked about the possibility of a film taking place after The Last Knight, actor Josh Duhamel had expressed interest in reprising his role as Colonel William Lennox.[122]\n- Untitled Angel Manuel Soto film: In March 2021, another film entered development directed by Ángel Manuel Soto, from a script written by Marco Ramirez. The plot will take place separately from films that have previously been released, while Lorenzo di Bonaventura, Don Murphy, and Tom DeSanto remain involved in their producing roles. The project will be a joint-venture production between eOne and Paramount Pictures.[123]\n- Untitled Rise of the Beasts sequels: In February 2022 at the ViacomCBS Investors' Event, Paramount announced that Rise of the Beasts will be the first installment of a new trilogy of films.[124][125] In June 2023, di Bonaventura stated that future installments will progressively include elements and characters from the G.I. Joes prior to the event of a crossover with the G.I. Joe series. Director, Caple Jr. stated that discussions have included adding additional Transformer factions from other planets into the series.[126] The filmmaker expressed interest in further exploring the origins of the Transformers, with hopes of including more details about their creator Primus in the future.[127]\nShared universe connections\n[edit]In March 2013, during the release of G.I. Joe: Retaliation, producer di Bonaventura announced the studio's plans to develop a G.I. Joe/Transformers crossover.[128] On July 26, 2013, G.I. Joe: Retaliation director Jon M. Chu stated that he was also interested in directing a Transformers/G.I. Joe crossover film.[104] Despite di Bonaventura stating that a crossover was not in the immediate plans for the franchises,[129] he acknowledged that it was something they intended to do.[130]\nIn March 2015, Paramount hired Academy Award-winning screenwriter Akiva Goldsman to oversee and compile a team of writers, to pitch ideas for future films to expand the franchise into a cinematic universe. Twelve individual stories were written and pitched for the cinematic universe. Goldsman was tasked with developing a multi-part sequel storyline, along with prequels and spin-off films. A \"brain trust\" was commissioned to guide the productions of these stories, including Goldsman, Michael Bay, and producers Steven Spielberg and Lorenzo di Bonaventura. The team of writers who were hired included: Robert Kirkman, Art Marcum, Matt Holloway, Zak Penn, Jeff Pinkner, Andrew Barrer, Gabriel Ferrari, Christina Hodson, Lindsey Anderson Beer, Ken Nolan, Geneva Robertson-Dworet, and Steven DeKnight. Goldsman described the writer's room collaboration process, as a way to map out stories that can be further developed by the projects that are green-lit by the brain trust; stating: \"...if one of the writers discovers an affinity for [a particular story], they can drive forward on treatments that will have been fleshed out by the whole room.\"[131][132] In August 2017, following the poor reception of The Last Knight which Goldsman co-wrote, the filmmaker officially left the franchise.[133] In December 2018, di Bonaventura stated that there will be further films in the series, while also acknowledging that the franchise will make some changes in tone and style due to the success of Bumblebee.[134] In July 2021, producer di Bonaventura and actor Henry Golding expressed interest developing a crossover film.[135][136]\nIn July 2021, a crossover film with the G.I. Joe film series was once again in development.[137] In June 2023, beginning with Rise of the Beasts, the two franchises began to share continuity. Producer di Bonaventura stated that in future films, actors from the G.I. Joe films may reprise their roles.[138] In July 2023, di Bonaventura stated that while the crossover would not interfere with the continuity of the franchise's first five installments, he believed that \"continuity's overblown, because sometimes you miss a great idea.\"[139] In April 2024, Paramount announced that a crossover film is in development.[140][141] Derek Connolly was hired to write the crossover film in June 2024.[142] Di Bonaventura announced to Collider that the crossover will be the next film.[143]\nOn November 20, 2024, in the wake of the underperformance of the animated film Transformers One (2024), Hasbro announced that they would no longer be co-financing film adaptions, instead leaving external studios to exclusively fund such projects.[144]\nShort films\n[edit]Transformers: Beginnings (2007)\n[edit]Released separately from the first film on home release in October 2007, on DVD as a Walmart Exclusive; the short is an animated prequel, presented in the form of a motion comic, with narration from the character Bumblebee. Mark Ryan provides the voice-over work for the role, while the short depicts Megatron's arrival on Earth, as well as Archibald Witwicky's discovery 4 million years later. The short skips to 2003 with Bumblebee arriving on Earth, and Sector 7's pursuit of him.[145]\nSector 7 Archive (2019)\n[edit]Released on the home video release of Bumblebee, two short films under a \"Sector 7 Archive\" label were released.[146]\nAgent Burns: Welcome to Sector 7 (2019)\n[edit]A short released as an in-universe orientation video, of Agent Burns addressing new hires.[147]\nSector 7 Adventures: The Battle at Half Dome (2019)\n[edit]A short film, released in the form of a motion comic, takes place two years after the events of Bumblebee which depicts a fight between Bumblebee and Soundwave. When Sector 7 is attacked by Soundwave, Bumblebee arrives to protect them. During the ensuing battle, Soundwave demands that Sector 7 give back what belongs to the Decepticons.[148]\nWeb series\n[edit]Transformers: Cyber Missions (2010)\n[edit]A 13-episode long web mini-series released in 2010 and set within and using the Transformers design from the continuity of the live-action movies. It was released on Hasbro's website and in 2011 re-released on Transformers' official YouTube channel.[151] The series was made by TG Studios in only three months.[152][better source needed] It is set between the events of Revenge of the Fallen and Dark of the Moon.[153]\nBumblebee's First Life on Earth (2019)\n[edit]Bumblebee's First Life on Earth (バンブルビー 初めての地球生活, Banburubī Hajimete no Chikyū Seikatsu) is a 3-episode long retelling of the first half of the Bumblebee film with no spoilers. The series was released on Paramount Pictures' Japanese Twitter account.[149][154]\nCast and characters\n[edit]Crew and production details\n[edit]Reception\n[edit]Box office performance\n[edit]Critical and public response\n[edit]The film series has met with generally negative to mixed reception. With the exception of Bumblebee, common elements of the original film series were held in low esteem by critics,[187] such as the repeated formulaic plots, sophomoric and toilet humor, female character objectification,[188][189] clichéd and controversial characterizations, racial and cultural stereotypes,[190] overuse of MacGuffins, product placement,[191] long running times, and excessive retroactive continuity changes (or retcons).[192][193][194]\nThe first Transformers film received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for its groundbreaking visual effects, sound design, action sequences, story, performances, with criticism for the Transformer redesigns and product placement.[166][167] The second film, Revenge of the Fallen, received negative reviews, with criticism of its screenplay and runtime, but praise for its visual effects and sound design. The third film, Dark of the Moon, received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for its visual effects and sound design, but criticism for its screenplay and runtime.[172][173]\nThe fourth film, Age of Extinction received negative reviews from critics for its runtime and direction. The fifth film The Last Knight received negative reviews from critics for its direction, thin plot, and overlong runtime.[178][179]\nBumblebee received positive reviews, with praise for its lighter tone, story, visuals, performances, voice acting, direction, action sequences, and faithfulness to the 1980s Transformers show.[181][182] Rise of the Beasts received mixed reviews, with critics calling it an improvement over the pre–Bumblebee films, but with some criticism of the runtime.[184]\nAccolades\n[edit]The franchise has been frequently praised and won awards for its visual effects and sound design. Michael Bay praised the crew and highlighted the importance of sound saying \"I have like 2,000 people – through their artistry – making my dreams a film,\" Bay said. \"The artistry of this sound group is just amazing. I love, love sound. It's 45–50% of the movies.\"[195]\nAcademy Awards\n[edit]Golden Raspberry Awards\n[edit]Visual Effects Society Awards\n[edit]Other media\n[edit]In addition to the films, the film series has a promotional expanded series that is set both before and after the events of the films. This includes comic books, video games, and novels. While the novels are partially based on the films themselves, and the video games are not in the same continuity as the films, the comic books and graphic novels are in the same continuity and fill in several parts of the stories from the films. Also, Transformers: The Ride 3D is an amusement ride based on the film series.

The Pipeline\nis a high-level inference class that supports text, audio, vision, and multimodal tasks. It handles preprocessing the input and returns the appropriate output.\nInstantiate a pipeline and specify model to use for text generation.

Finally, pass some text to prompt the model.\nfrom transformers import pipeline\npipeline = pipeline(task=\"text-generation\", model=\"Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B\")\npipeline(\"the secret to baking a really good cake is \")\n[{'generated_text': 'the secret to baking a really good cake is 1) to use the right ingredients and 2) to follow the recipe exactly. the recipe for the cake is as follows: 1 cup of sugar, 1 cup of flour, 1 cup of milk, 1 cup of butter, 1 cup of eggs, 1 cup of chocolate chips. if you want to make 2 cakes, how much sugar do you need?

          "content": "Transformers\nTransformers is a media franchise produced by Japanese toy company Takara Tomy and American toy company Hasbro. It primarily follows the heroic Autobots and the villainous Decepticons, two alien robot factions at war that can transform into other forms, such as vehicles and animals. The franchise encompasses toys, animation, comic books, video games and films. As of 2011, it generated more than ¥2 trillion ($25 billion) in revenue,[1] making it one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.\nThe franchise began in 1984 with the Transformers toy line, comprising transforming mecha toys from Takara's Diaclone and Micro Change toylines rebranded for Western markets.[2] The term \"Generation 1\" (G1) covers both the animated television series The Transformers and the comic book series of the same name, which are further divided into Japanese, British and Canadian spin-offs. Sequels followed, such as the Generation 2 comic book and Beast Wars TV series, which became its own mini-universe. Generation 1 characters have been rebooted multiple times in the 21st century in comics from Dreamwave Productions (starting 2001), IDW Publishing (starting in 2005 and again in 2019), and Skybound Entertainment (beginning in 2023). There have been other incarnations of the story based on different toy lines during and after the 20th century. The first was the Robots in Disguise series, followed by three shows (Armada, Energon, and Cybertron) that constitute a single universe called the \"Unicron Trilogy\".\nA live-action film series started in 2007, again distinct from previous incarnations, while the Transformers: Animated series merged concepts from the G1 continuity, the 2007 live-action film and the \"Unicron Trilogy\". For most of the 2010s, in an attempt to mitigate the wave of reboots, the \"Aligned Continuity\" was established. In 2018, Transformers: Cyberverse debuted, once again, distinct from the previous incarnations. Another series, Transformers: EarthSpark, debuted in 2022, again separate from previous continuities. The 2024 animated film, Transformers One, once again takes place in a new continuity.\nAlthough a separate and competing franchise started in 1983, Tonka's GoBots became the intellectual property of Hasbro after their buyout of Tonka in 1991. Subsequently, the universe depicted in the animated series Challenge of the GoBots and follow-up film GoBots: Battle of the Rock Lords was retroactively established as an alternate universe within the Transformers multiverse.[3]\nFiction\nTransformers: Generation 1 (1984–1993)\nGeneration 1 is a retroactive term for the Transformers characters that appeared between 1984 and 1993. The Transformers began with the 1980s Japanese toy lines Micro Change and Diaclone. They presented robots able to transform into everyday vehicles, electronic items or weapons. Hasbro bought the Micro Change and Diaclone toys, and partnered with Takara.[4] Marvel Comics was hired by Hasbro to create the backstory; editor-in-chief Jim Shooter wrote an overall story, and gave the task of creating the characters to writer Dennis O'Neil.[5] Unhappy with O'Neil's work (although O'Neil created the name \"Optimus Prime\"), Shooter chose Bob Budiansky to create the characters.[6]\nThe Transformers mecha were largely designed by Shōji Kawamori, the creator of the Japanese mecha anime franchise Macross (which was adapted into the Robotech franchise in North America).[7] Kawamori came up with the idea of transforming mechs while working on the Diaclone and Macross franchises in the early 1980s (such as the VF-1 Valkyrie in Macross and Robotech), with his Diaclone mechs later providing the basis for Transformers.[8]\nThe primary concept of Generation 1 is that the heroic Optimus Prime, the villainous Megatron, and their finest soldiers crash-land on prehistoric Earth in the Ark and the Nemesis before awakening in 1985, Cybertron hurtling through the Neutral zone as an effect of the war. The Marvel comic was originally part of the main Marvel Universe, with appearances from Spider-Man and Nick Fury, plus some cameos,[9] as well as a visit to the Savage Land.[10]\nThe Transformers TV series began around the same time. Produced by Sunbow Productions and Marvel Productions, later Hasbro Productions, from the start it contradicted Budiansky's backstories. The TV series shows the Autobots looking for new energy sources, and crash landing as the Decepticons attack.[11] Marvel interpreted the Autobots as destroying a rogue asteroid approaching Cybertron.[12] Shockwave is loyal to Megatron on the TV series, keeping Cybertron in a stalemate during his absence,[13] but in the comic book, he attempts to take command of the Decepticons.[14] The TV series would also differ wildly from the origins Budiansky had created for the Dinobots,[15][16] the Decepticon turned Autobot Jetfire[17] (known as Skyfire on TV[18]), the Constructicons (who combine to form Devastator),[19][20] and Omega Supreme.[19][21] The Marvel comic establishes early on that Prime wields the Creation Matrix, which gives life to machines. In the second season, the two-part episode The Key to Vector Sigma introduced the ancient Vector Sigma computer, which served the same original purpose as the Creation Matrix (giving life to Transformers), and its guardian Alpha Trion.\nIn 1986, the cartoon became the film The Transformers: The Movie, which is set in the year 2005. It introduced the Matrix as the \"Autobot Matrix of Leadership\", as a fatally wounded Prime gives it to Ultra Magnus; however, as Prime dies he drops the matrix, which is then caught by Hot Rod who subsequently becomes Rodimus Prime later on in the film. Unicron, a Transformer who devours planets, fears its power and re-creates a heavily damaged Megatron as Galvatron, as well as Bombshell or Skywarp becoming Cyclonus, Thundercracker becoming Scourge and two other Insecticons becoming Scourge's huntsmen, the Sweeps. Eventually, Rodimus Prime takes out the Matrix and destroys Unicron.[22] In the United Kingdom, the weekly comic book interspliced original material to keep up with U.S. reprints,[23] and The Movie provided much new material. Writer Simon Furman proceeded to expand the continuity with movie spin-offs involving the time travelling Galvatron.[24][25] The Movie also featured guest voices from Leonard Nimoy as Galvatron, Scatman Crothers as Jazz, Casey Kasem as Cliffjumper, Orson Welles as Unicron and Eric Idle as the leader of the Junkions (Wreck-Gar, though unnamed in the movie). The Transformers theme tune for the film was performed by Lion with \"Weird Al\" Yankovic adding a song to the soundtrack.\nThe third season followed up The Movie, with the revelation of the Quintessons having used Cybertron as a factory. Their robots rebel, and in time the workers become the Autobots and the soldiers become the Decepticons. (Note: This appears to contradict background presented in the first two seasons of the series.) It is the Autobots who develop transformation.[26] Due to popular demand,[27] Optimus Prime is resurrected at the conclusion of the third season,[28] and the series ended with a three-episode story arc. However, the Japanese broadcast of the series was supplemented with a newly produced OVA, Scramble City, before creating entirely new series to continue the storyline, ignoring the 1987 end of the American series. The extended Japanese run consisted of The Headmasters, Super-God Masterforce, Victory and Zone, then in illustrated magazine form as Battlestars: Return of Convoy and Operation: Combination. Just as the TV series was wrapping up, Marvel continued to expand its continuity. It follows The Movie's example by killing Prime[29] and Megatron,[30] albeit in the present day. Dinobot leader Grimlock takes over as Autobot leader.[31] There was a G.I. Joe crossover[32] and the limited series The Transformers: Headmasters, which further expanded the scope to the planet Nebulon.[33] It led on to the main title resurrecting Prime as a Powermaster.[34]\nIn the United Kingdom, the mythology continued to grow. Primus is introduced as the creator of the Transformers, to serve his material body that is planet Cybertron and fight his nemesis Unicron.[35] Female Autobot Arcee also appeared, despite the comic book stating the Transformers had no concept of gender, with her backstory of being built by the Autobots to quell human accusations of sexism.[36] Soundwave, Megatron's second-in-command, also breaks the fourth wall in the letters page, criticising the cartoon continuity as an inaccurate representation of history.[37] The UK also had a crossover in Action Force, the UK counterpart to G.I. Joe.[38] The comic book features a resurrected Megatron,[39] whom Furman retconned to be a clone[40] when he took over the U.S. comic book, which depicted Megatron as still dead.[41] The U.S. comic would last for 80 issues until 1991,[42] and the UK comic lasted 332 issues and several annuals, until it was replaced as Dreamwave Productions, later in the 20th century.\nIn 2009, Shout! Factory released the entire G1 series in a 16-DVD box set called the Matrix of Leadership Edition.[43] They also released the same content as individual seasons.[44]\nTransformers: Generation 2 (1993–1995)\nIt was five issues[45] of the G.I. Joe comic in 1993 that would springboard a return for Marvel's Transformers, with the new twelve-issue series Transformers: Generation 2, to market a new toy line.\nThis story reveals that the Transformers originally breed asexually, though it is stopped by Primus because it produced the evil Swarm.[46] A new empire, neither Autobot nor Decepticon, is bringing it back, however. Though the year-long arc wrapped itself up with an alliance between Optimus Prime and Megatron, the final panel introduces the Liege Maximo, ancestor of the Decepticons.[47] This minor cliffhanger was not resolved until 2001 and 2002's Transforce convention when writer Simon Furman concluded his story in the exclusive novella Alignment.[48]\nBeast Wars and Beast Machines (1996–2000)\nThe story focuses on a small group of Maximals (the new Autobots), led by Optimus Primal, and Predacons, led by Megatron, 300 years after the \"Great War\". After a dangerous pursuit through transwarp space, both the Maximal and Predacon factions end up crash landing on a primitive, uncivilized planet similar to Earth, but with two moons and a dangerous level of Energon (which is later revealed to be prehistoric Earth with an artificial second moon, taking place sometime during the 4 million year period in which the Autobots and Decepticons were in suspended animation from the first episode of the original Transformers cartoon), which forces them to take organic beast forms in order to function without going into stasis lock.[49] After writing this first episode, Bob Forward and Larry DiTillio learned of the G1 Transformers and began to use elements of it as a historical backstory to their scripts,[50] establishing Beast Wars as a part of the Generation 1 universe through numerous callbacks to both the cartoon and the Marvel comic. By the end of the first season, the second moon and the Energon are revealed to have been constructed by a mysterious alien race known as the Vok.\nThe destruction of the second moon releases mysterious energies that make some of the characters \"transmetal\" and the planet is revealed to be prehistoric Earth, leading to the discovery of the Ark. Megatron attempts to kill the original Optimus Prime,[51] but at the beginning of the third season, Primal manages to preserve his spark. In the two-season follow-up series, Beast Machines, Cybertron is revealed to have organic origins, which Megatron attempts to stamp out.\nAfter the first season of Beast Wars (comprising 26 episodes) aired in Japan, the Japanese were faced with a problem. The second Canadian season was only 13 episodes long, not enough to warrant airing on Japanese TV. While they waited for the third Canadian season to be completed (thereby making 26 episodes in total when added to season 2), they produced two exclusive cel-animated series of their own, Beast Wars II (also called Beast Wars Second) and Beast Wars Neo, to fill in the gap. Dreamwave retroactively revealed Beast Wars to be the future of their G1 universe,[52] and the 2006 IDW comic book Beast Wars: The Gathering eventually confirmed the Japanese series to be canon[53] within a story set during Season 3.[54]\nBeast Wars contained elements from both the G1 cartoon series and comics. Attributes taken from the cartoon include Transformers that were female, the appearance of Starscream (who mentions being killed off by Galvatron in The Transformers: The Movie), and appearances of the Plasma Energy Chamber and Key to Vector Sigma. The naming of the Transformer ship, the Ark (and reference to 1984, the year the Transformers on board are revived), the character Ravage being shown as intelligent, and Cybertron having an organic core are elements taken from the comics.\nIn 2011, Shout! Factory released the complete series of Beast Wars on DVD.[55]\nDreamwave Productions (2001–2005)\nIn 2001, Dreamwave Productions began a new universe of annual comics adapted from Marvel, but also included elements of the animated. The Dreamwave stories followed the concept of the Autobots defeating the Decepticons on Earth, but their 1997 return journey to Cybertron on the Ark II[56] is destroyed by Shockwave, now ruler of the planet.[57] The story follows on from there and was told in two six-issue limited series, then a ten-issue ongoing series. The series also adds extra complexities such as not all Transformers believing in the existence of Primus,[58] corruption in the Cybertronian government that first led Megatron to begin his war,[59] and Earth having an unknown relevance to Cybertron.[57][60]\nThree Transformers: The War Within limited series were also published. These are set at the beginning of the Great War, and identify Prime as once being a clerk named Optronix.[61] Beast Wars was also retroactively stated as the future of this continuity, with the profile series More than Meets the Eye showing the Predacon Megatron looking at historical files detailing Dreamwave's characters and taking his name from the original Megatron.[52] In 2004, this real life universe also inspired three novels[62] and a Dorling Kindersley guide, which focused on Dreamwave as the \"true\" continuity when discussing in-universe elements of the characters. In a new twist, Primus and Unicron are siblings, formerly a being known as the One. Transformers: Micromasters, set after the Ark's disappearance, was also published. The real life universe was disrupted when Dreamwave went bankrupt in 2005.[63] This left the Generation 1 story hanging and the third volume of The War Within half finished. Plans for a comic book set between Beast Wars and Beast Machines were also left unrealized.[64]\nG.I. Joe crossovers (2003–present)\nThroughout the years, the G1 characters have also starred in crossovers with fellow Hasbro property G.I. Joe, but whereas those crossovers published by Marvel were in continuity with their larger storyline, those released by Dreamwave and G.I. Joe publisher Devil's Due Publishing occupy their own separate real life universes. In Devil's Due, the terrorist organization COBRA Command is responsible for finding and reactivating the Transformers. Dreamwave's version reimagines the familiar G1 and G.I. Joe characters in a World War II setting, and a second limited series was released set in the present day, though Dreamwave's bankruptcy meant it was cancelled after a single issue. Devil's Due had Cobra re-engineer the Transformers to turn into familiar Cobra vehicles, and released further mini-series that sent the characters travelling through time, battling Serpentor and being faced with the combined menace of Cobra-La and Unicron. During this time, Cobra teams up with the Decepticons. IDW Publishing has expressed interest in their own crossover.[65]\nIDW publishing (2005–2022)\nThe following year, IDW Publishing rebooted the G1 series from scratch within various limited series and one shots. This allowed long-time writer of Marvel and Dreamwave comics, Simon Furman, to create his own universe without continuity hindrance, similar to Ultimate Marvel. This new continuity originally consisted of a comic book series titled The Transformers with a companion series known as The Transformers: Spotlight. The main series was broken up into several story arcs. Eventually, with IDW Publishing losing sales, the series was given a soft reboot. Beginning with All Hail Megatron, the series was set in a new direction, discarding the miniseries and Spotlight format with ongoing comics. By 2012 the series had split into three ongoing series; The Transformers: More Than Meets The Eye, The Transformers: Robots in Disguise (which later changed in 2015 to \"The Transformers\") and The Transformers: Till All Are One. In 2022, it was announced that IDW lost the publishing rights to Transformers.[66]\nAlternative stories\nIn January 2006, the Hasbro Transformers Collectors' Club comic wrote a story based on the Transformers Classics toy line, set in the Marvel Comics universe, but excluding the Generation 2 comic. Fifteen years after Megatron crash-lands in the Ark with Ratchet, the war continues with the characters in their Classics bodies.[67]\nIDW Publishing introduced The Transformers: Evolutions in 2006, a collection of mini-series that re-imagine and reinterpret the G1 characters in various ways. To date, only one miniseries has been published, Hearts of Steel, placing the characters in an Industrial Revolution-era setting. The series was delayed as Hasbro did not want to confuse newcomers with too many fictional universes before the release of the live-action film.[68]\nHowever, IDW and the original publisher Marvel Comics announced a crossover storyline with the Avengers to coincide with the film New Avengers/Transformers.[69] The story is set on the borders of Symkaria and Latveria, and its fictional universe is set between the first two New Avengers storylines, as well in between the Infiltration and Escalation phase of IDW's The Transformers.[70] IDW editor-in-chief, Chris Ryall hinted at elements of it being carried over into the main continuities,[71] and that a sequel is possible.[72] In June 2018 it was announced there would be Star Trek and Transformers Crossover being released in September 2018.[73]\nTransformers: Kiss Players (2006–2007)\nTransformers: Kiss Players (トランスフォーマー キスぷれ, Toransufōmā Kisu Pure), shortened to Kiss Players (キスぷれ, Kisu Pure), is a Japanese Transformers franchise which began in 2006 to 2007 as was helmed by artist and writer Yuki Ohshima. By virtue of being the only Transformers toyline and fiction released in Japan by Takara between the conclusion of Transformers: Cybertron and the live-action movie, it was also effectively the main Transformers line in the country for that time. It takes place in the Generation 1 cartoon continuity, specifically in the five-year milieu between The Transformers: The Movie and Transformers 2010.[74]\nThe series derives its name from its controversial gimmick, which involves Transformers getting \"power-ups\" when they are kissed by human girls - the eponymous \"Kiss Players\" - who fuse with the robots and share their adventures. The plot starts with the Earth Defense Command being formed in 2003 as part of a cooperative human/Autobot effort. When a virus called the Cosmic Rust critically struck the Autobots later that year, the EDC kicked off the Binaltech Project to shore up its defenses. When Galvatron was hurled out of Unicron by Rodimus Prime in 2005, rather than immediately crashing onto the intended target of the planet Thrull, he instead hurtled toward Earth. Landing in Tokyo, Japan, the Decepticon leader's impact decimated the city and scattered his Unicron-mutated cells throughout Earth's atmosphere. Following this catastrophe, the EDC was reborn as an organization dedicated to driving all Transformers off Earth. The organization built an anti-electron field (previously referred to as an Energon field) to make the planet uninhabitable to Cybertronians, and created a team of 48 transforming robots known as Autoroopers (オートルーパー Ōtorūpā), a Japanese portmanteau of \"auto\" (オート ōto) and \"trooper\" (トルーパー torūpā) or Autotroopers (aka Autobot Troopers) in English, are a group of human-created artificial Transformers that serve the Earth Defense Command to combat any other Transformers that remained,[75] recruiting young women who had been infected with the cells and gained Kiss Player fusion abilities to partner with them.\nThe three central characters were a younger version of Marissa Faireborn[76] as a resistance fighter against the EDC partnered with Optimus Prime who while having died in the movie, his body body was recovered and restored to life in a new body resembling that of a Dodge Ram pickup by the same organization. Rodimus devastated by his guilt in his role of the destruction of Tokyo stepped down as the then leader of the Autobots reverting to the previous name of Hot Rod in order to return to Earth to atone for his mistake. He's refitted into a vehicle resembling a Ford GT by his headstrong partner Shaoshao Li,[77] a girl of Chinese descent and an estranged friend of Marissa and used to be one of the EDC's top Kiss Players until realizing that the EDC was conducting experiments behind her back on other girls. She was then rescued by Hot Rod and joins the resistance to combat the EDC and make amends with her former friend. Lastly, Atari Hitotonari[78] of Japanese descent, who \"recruited\" into the EDC after the death of her parents while suffering from survivor's guilt. She would shortly become depressed and self-destructive. As she spoke aloud about her nihilistic feelings she would meet her partner by the name Ne-04,[79] a Autorooper built in the form resembling a Mazda RX-8 would shared the same feeling as she did though with the time they spend together their way of thinking would change throughout their relationship. While this plotline seems like a shift in demographics to little girls, it is said that this line was aimed at a much older adult male audience. The toys bear an \"ages 15 and up\" warning, and the subject matter of the accompanying manga is far from child-friendly. The franchise itself consists of a toyline, a weekly radio drama series (featuring voice acting by Lyrian as Marissa, Yui Kano as Shaoshao, Satomi Akesaka as Atari, and Keiji Hirai as Ne-04 among others), and a three part manga, which together tell the story of the line in which the toys and manga all of which were also created by Ohshima.[80]\nFollowing the conclusion of its first storyline in late 2007, Kiss Players moved into its second (and apparently final) phase, Kiss Players Position, which shifted focus to a distinctly more PG-rated theme, though it was still heavy on the \"cute girls\" theme. The Kiss Players this time are a pop idol singing group made up of the three girls and three original mini-cassette Transformers Glit,[81] Sundor[82] the former is a spy and the latter shows compassion to both allies and enemies, and Rosanna[83] who's the only heroic one out of the three. The group's purpose is to promote a positive relationship and friendship between humans and Transformers in the wake of the Tokyo disaster of 2005 and the subsequent rise and fall of the E.D.C.. They wear E.D.C. logos on their costumes as a group, appearing to be either sponsored by or a public-relations arm of the revitalized organization.[80]\nAdditionally, Ohshima's other major contribution to Transformers at the time, the 1-page Information Administration Teletraan 15 Go! Go! comic published in Dengeki Hobby magazine, also featured several tie-ins to the Kiss Players story. These primarily served to introduce readers to the Kiss Players story and characters when the line was launched, and then later, to summarize the final few radio dramas when both series were drawing to a close. Information Administration Teletraan 15 Go! Go! also featured the first part of a story in which Starscream's ghost possessed Atari (which was continued in the radio drama), and in the second year, notably incorporated the further adventures of the Kiss Players Position cassette trio, who were rather confusingly dropped from the radio storyline in its second week and never mentioned again.[84]\nReactions ran the gamut from outright disgust to comedic derision, with most fans agreeing that the content such be included a children's toyline was distasteful. The fact that several Japanese fans were themselves openly decrying Kiss Players, fearing that American fans would think that it was somehow accepted as normal in Japan regarding its sexually suggestive material. Oshima himself even admitted that he crafted the series in this manner because he wanted to \"make people's jaws drop.\"[citation needed]\nMany of its characters and ideas have made appearances in other Transformers media. The Autroopers appeared in Transformers: Animated in 2009 with an official toyline released in Botcon in 2011.[85] The colors of white and blue used for Glit would inspire the Shattered Glass incarnation of Ravage.[86] A new toy figure of Sundor would be released under the Transformers Generations: The Fall of Cybertron line in 2012.[87] Several ideas introduced into the 2007 storyline focusing on the introduction of Primus into the Japanese cartoon's timeline have been revisited and expanded upon, which shares Kiss Players storytelling while attempting to fill in gaps of the timeline in the Japanese Generation 1 cartoon continuity. The Transformers Legends manga, while featuring lewd content and new stories and characters, also has the two returning and older characters of Atari and Shaoshao.[88]\nPossibly as a result of the majority of fans trying to distance themselves from the series combined with the then general inaccessibility of the radio show to an English audience, there was minimal awareness of the specific details of the Kiss Players storyline in the Japanese fandom. However, on July 19, 2022, most of the original media (including the radio dramas, manga, comic, and other materials) were recovered. This material was remastered and translated into English and released via torrent for download.\nRobots in Disguise (2000–2001)\nFirst broadcast in Japan in 2000, Robots in Disguise was a single animated series consisting of thirty-nine episodes. It was exported to other countries in subsequent years. In this continuity, Megatron re-creates the Decepticons as a sub-faction of the Predacons on Earth, a potential reference to the return to the vehicle-based characters following the previous dominance of the animal-based characters of the Beast eras. It is a stand-alone universe with no ties to any other Transformers fiction, though some of the characters from Robots in Disguise did eventually make appearances in Transformers: Universe, including Optimus Prime, Ultra Magnus, Side Burn and Prowl.\nThe show was heavily censored in the U.S. due to its content of buildings being destroyed and terrorism references after the September 11 attacks on the United States and three episodes were cut altogether.[89]\nThe Unicron Trilogy (2002–2006)\nThese three lines, launched in 2002 and dubbed the \"Unicron Trilogy\" by Transformers designer Aaron Archer,[90] are co-productions between Takara and (lesser extent) Hasbro, simultaneously released in both countries, each lasting 52 episodes. Armada followed the Autobots and Decepticons discovering the powerful Mini-Cons on Earth, which are revealed by the end to be weapons of Unicron. Energon, set ten years later, followed the Autobots and the Omnicons in their fight to stop the Decepticons and the Terrorcons from resurrecting Unicron with energon.\nIn Japan, the series Transformers: Cybertron showed no ties to the previous two series, telling its own story. This caused continuity problems when Hasbro sold Cybertron as a follow-up to Armada/Energon. The writers attempted to change certain plot elements from the Japanese version to remedy this, although this largely added up to nothing more than references to Unicron, Primus, Primes and Minicons.\nJust as Marvel produced a companion comic to Generation 1, Dreamwave Productions published the comic Transformers Armada set in a different continuity from the cartoon. At #19, it became Transformers Energon. Dreamwave went bankrupt and ceased all publications before the storyline could be completed at #30. However, the Transformers Fan Club published a few stories set in the Cybertron era.[91]\nTransformers: Universe (2003–present)\nThe storyline of Transformers: Universe, mainly set following Beast Machines, sees characters from many assorted alternate continuities, including existing and new ones, encountering each other. The story was told in an unfinished comic book exclusive to the Official Transformers Collectors' Convention.\nLive-action film franchise (2007–present)\nIn 2007, Michael Bay directed a live-action film based on Transformers, with Steven Spielberg serving as executive producer. It stars Shia LaBeouf, Josh Duhamel, Megan Fox, and Tyrese Gibson in the lead human cast while voice actors Peter Cullen and Hugo Weaving voice Optimus Prime and Megatron, respectively. Transformers received mixed to positive reviews and was a box office success.[92] It is the forty-fifth highest-grossing film and the fifth highest-grossing film of 2007, grossing approximately $709 million worldwide. The film won four awards from the Visual Effects Society and was nominated for three Academy Awards, for Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Visual Effects. The performance of Shia LaBeouf was praised by Empire, and Peter Cullen's reprisal of Optimus Prime from the 1980s television series was well received by fans. A sequel, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, was released on June 24, 2009. It received mostly negative reviews, but was a commercial success and grossed more than its predecessor. A third film, Transformers: Dark of the Moon, was released on June 29, 2011, in 3-D and went on to gross over $1 billion, despite receiving mixed reviews. A fourth film, Transformers: Age of Extinction, was released on June 27, 2014, which also grossed over $1 billion, though it received generally negative reviews. A fifth film, Transformers: The Last Knight was released on June 23, 2017 to similarly negative reviews. Unlike its predecessors, the movie failed to recoup its costs for the studio.[93] Bumblebee, directed by Laika's Travis Knight, was released on December 21, 2018, serving as a prequel to the first film, receiving positive reviews from critics. The movie was a box-office success. A sequel to Bumblebee, directed by Steven Caple Jr. and titled Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, was released on June 9, 2023 to mixed reviews from critics.\nTransformers: Animated (2007–2010)\nTransformers: Animated is a cartoon that was aired in early 2008 on Cartoon Network in the United States.[94] Originally scheduled for late after 2007 under the title of Transformers: Heroes,[95] Transformers Animated is set in 2050 Detroit (after crash landing 50 years earlier),[94] when robots and humans live side by side.[95] The Autobots come to Earth and assume superhero roles, battling evil humans, with the Decepticons having a smaller role until Megatron resurfaces.[96] Main characters include Autobots Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Bulkhead, Prowl, and Ratchet; Decepticons Megatron, Starscream, Blitzwing, Lugnut, and Blackarachnia; and humans Professor Sumdac and Sari Sumdac. Several characters that were in the original Transformers cartoon and 1986 animated movie, as well as characters only seen in comics and such, make special appearances and cameos throughout the show, with various voice actors (including Corey Burton, John Moschitta, Jr., Susan Blu, and Judd Nelson) reprising their roles.\nAligned Universe (2010–2021)\nHasbro, in an attempt to stop the wave of reboots that started in 2001, created the Aligned Universe, with the intent to unify every Transformers media into one continuity. The name of this continuity however, is not official; it was adopted by the fans after Hasbro referred to it as an \"Aligned Continuity\".[97]\nThe toy lines derived from this continuity are Transformers: Generations, Transformers: Rescue Bots, and Transformers Go! The television series belonging to the Aligned Universe include Transformers: Prime (including its concluding film Prime Beast Hunters: Predacons Rising[98]), the Rescue Bots TV series,[99] its sequel Transformers: Rescue Bots Academy, the Go! anime adaptation, and the 2015 series Transformers: Robots in Disguise.[100]\nThe video games that are part of this shared universe are Transformers: War for Cybertron (including its Nintendo DS version and the companion Transformers: Cybertron Adventures), Transformers: Fall of Cybertron, the Prime video game adaptation,[101][102] and Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark, that serves as a conclusion of the Cybertron series and crossover with the live-action film video game series.\nFour novels set within the continuity have been published: Transformers: Exodus,[103][104] Transformers: Exiles,[105][106] Transformers: Retribution,[107][108] and Transformers: The Covenant of Primus.[109] The first three were published by Del Rey Books, while Covenant of Primus was published by 47North. In addition, IDW Publishing has published several comic books, including graphic novels, while Titan Magazines published Transformers Comic UK, a 20-issue series from 2007 to 2014.\nThe video games, novels, and television series contradict each other due to creative differences, miscommunications, constant team changes, and Aaron Archer being replaced with a different person that did not know the 354-page brand bible, \"The Binder of Revelation\".[110]\nTransformers: Prime Wars Trilogy (2016–2018)\nIn August 2016, Machinima and Hasbro co-produced an animated series named Combiner Wars, simultaneously published on the website Go90 and YouTube. This was followed by two further installments, Titans Return and Power of the Primes. Eric Calderon was executive producer of the trilogy.[111] The events of the series take place 40 years after the end of the Autobot/Decepticon civil war, with the Transformers having returned to Cybertron and now being threatened by ancient technology.\nThe trailer for Combiner Wars was released on July 26, 2016, along with four prequel episodes.[112] Eight five-minute episodes of the series Combiner Wars were released weekly beginning on August 2.[112][113] The cast of the Combiner Wars was predominantly made up of famous YouTube personalities.[114] The first series was included as a bonus feature on the Transformers: The Last Knight Blu-ray release.[115]\nThe second series, dubbed Titans Return featured returning voice cast from previous iterations of Transformers, such as Peter Cullen and Judd Nelson, along with newcomers such as Michael Dorn as Perceptor and Wil Wheaton as Fortress Maximus.[114] Guest voices included Mark Hamill and Ron Perlman.[116] Titans Return debuted on November 14, 2017, on the Go90 platform, consisting of ten episodes at roughly 11 minutes each. The series featured returning Titan characters such as Metroplex, Fortress Maximus and Trypticon and the resultant destruction such enormous characters create.[117]\nThe third part of the trilogy, dubbed Power of the Primes was launched on May 1, 2018,[118] comprising 10 episodes released weekly, each roughly 11 minutes long. FJ DeSanto was executive producer of the third installment. Animation was done by Tatsunoko Productions.[119] Power of the Primes focused on the arrival of Megatronus, one of the original Primes.[120] In 2019, Machinima shut down[121] and folded into Otter Media. On January 19, Machinima removed all of its videos from YouTube, including those of the Prime Wars Trilogy.[122] After the shutdown, a number of former Machinima creations returned to the web via Rooster Teeth.[123] The series is available on the Rooster Teeth website.[124]\nTransformers: Cyberverse (2018–2021)\nTransformers: Cyberverse (later known as Transformers: Bumblebee Cyberverse Adventures for seasons 3 and 4) is an animated series produced by Boulder Media and Allspark Animation (later Entertainment One) which premiered on September 1, 2018 on Cartoon Network[125] and concluded on November 21, 2021 on Netflix comprising four chapters, of which the fourth was composed of two specials.[126] Cyberverse uses characters and elements across various continuities, including G1, Beast Era, the live-action film series, Animated, and the Aligned continuity, to tell its own story.[125]\nTransformers: War for Cybertron Trilogy (2020–2021)\nThe Transformers: War for Cybertron Trilogy is an animated three-part series that was developed as a co-production between Rooster Teeth, Netflix and Hasbro. Polygon Pictures was chosen as the animation studio. Headed by FJ DeSanto, a veteran of Transformers animation having previously worked on two installments of the Power of the Primes trilogy, the series tells the origin of the civil war between the Autobots and Decepticons.[127] Comprising three parts, the series was announced on February 15, 2019, for release on Netflix.[128][129] The voice cast of the show used new actors for recognizable characters such as Jake Foushou as Optimus Prime and Jason Marnocha as Megatron.[130] Each series is made up of six episodes, each a half hour long.[130] The series also had a tie-in toyline.[131]\nA trailer of for the first installment Siege was released on July 8, 2020, with the show following on July 30, 2020,[130][132] The first series focuses on the civil war on Cybertron and the conflict between the two leaders of the opposing factions, Optimus Prime and Megatron, along with the introduction of a third, mercenary, faction.[131][133]\nA trailer for the second series, dubbed Earthrise, was published on December 7, 2020[134] The second series debuted on Netflix on December 30.[135] Earthrise was more limited in scope than the previous series. Instead of the entire Transformer civil war, this series focuses on the two leaders once again and the crews of their starships as Optimus seeks to flee Cybertron and find the missing Allspark. The series also saw the introduction of a fourth faction, the Quintessons.[136]\nThe trailer for the final series, Kingdom, debuted on July 5, 2021[137] and the series premiered on Netflix on July 29.[130] Kingdom picks up where the last series leaves off with Optimus and Megatron searching for the Allspark, having now crash-landed on Earth. On the planet, they encounter characters previously seen in the older series Transformers: Beast Wars.[138]\nTransformers: BotBots (2022)\nTransformers: BotBots is an animated comedy streaming television series developed by Kevin Burke and Chris \"Doc\" Wyatt for Netflix comprising 20 episodes.[139] The first season of ten episodes was released on March 25, 2022.[140] In a departure from the traditional conflict between the Autobots and Decepticons seen in most continuities, the series focuses on the BotBots, small robots organized in groups of tribes who can transform into everyday objects, and primarily follows the efforts of the Lost Bots, who try to find their own place amongst the others.[139]\nTransformers: EarthSpark (2022–present)\nTransformers: EarthSpark is an animated television series produced by Entertainment One and Nickelodeon Animation Studio for the streaming service Paramount+ and the television network Nickelodeon, which debuted on November 11, 2022.[141] EarthSpark is notable for prominently featuring humans after being mostly absent in various media of the franchise in the late 2010s such as Cyberverse, the 2019 IDW comics and War for Cybertron Trilogy, and uses a union voice cast for the first time since 2018.\nTransformers One (2024)\nUpon the establishment of a writers' room for devising ideas regarding future Transformers films in 2015, the duo of Andrew Barrer and Gabriel Ferrari immediately conceived the concept of an animated prequel film depicting the beginnings of the Autobot-Decepticon war on Cybertron.[142][143] The film is directed by Josh Cooley, who oversaw the story treatment by Barrer and Ferrari with additional script contributions by Eric Pearson.[144][145] The film's narrative is centered on the respective origin stories of Optimus Prime and Megatron, chroncling their early friendship as Energon miners named Orion Pax and D-16, and the rift that causes their evolution into the respective leaders of the Autobots and Decepticons, beginning their long-standing conflict.[146][147] Chris Hemsworth and Brian Tyree Henry lead the film's ensemble voice cast as Orion Pax and D-16 respectively, alongside Scarlett Johansson, Keegan-Michael Key, Jon Hamm and Laurence Fishburne.[148][149] The film's score was composed by Brian Tyler, returning to the franchise after previously scoring Transformers: Prime.[150] Transformers One released in September 2024, and received positive critical reception despite financially underperforming at the box office, grossing $124.2 million worldwide against a budget estimated to be between $75–147 million.[151][152][153][154] Despite this, producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura expressed the desire for the film to launch a potential trilogy, confirming that the story was mapped out to illustrate a multi-film progression of the characters towards their traditional depictions in other media, such as the live-action films.[155] By the film's release, di Bonaventura confirmed that the filmmakers were already outlining plans for a sequel, and that it would be produced if the film is considered successful.[156]\nSee also\nReferences\n- ^ \"政府、ハリウッドにアニメ・玩具セールス 国策会社設立\".

          "content": "Main Page\nFrom Transformers Wiki\nvCurrent Releases\nvFundamentals\nvFeatured Article\nEstrela is a popular Brazilian toy manufacturer, being first founded in São Paulo in 1937 and remaining active to this day.\nThey are best known internationally for holding the license to produce and market multiple Hasbro toylines during the 1980s like G.I. Joe (under the localized name of Comandos em Ação, i.e., \"Commandos in Action\"), My Little Pony (under the localized name of Meu Querido Pônei, i.e., \"My Dear Pony\") and, of course, The Transformers (under the localized name of, uh, \"Transformers\"). Although much of the Transformers mainline was ignored by Estrela, their aforementioned freedom to manufacture their own toys during this time resulted in multiple variants of existing molds — and even some entirely unique ones! — that remained exclusive to the Brazilian market.\nEstrela also distributed most Transformers toylines in the country up until Cybertron, being later replaced by Hasbro's own Brazilian subsidiary starting from 2007. The fallout was a long and complicated legal dispute between the two companies regarding royalties for the Hasbro-derived toylines that Estrela was still manufacturing domestically, lasting all the way up until its settlement in 2021.\nvThis Day in History: May 22\n- 1930 — Author John Grant is born.\n- 1945 — Marvel Comics artist Carlos Garzón is born in Colombia.\n- 1951 — Sérgio Fortuna (Brazilian voice of Cyber Missions Optimus Prime, Cogman and Shockwave) is born.\n- 1957 — Writer Ken Pontac is born.\n- 1966 — Cássius Romero (Portuguese voice of Cheetor, Maven Danger and Grimlock) is born.\n- 1969 — Actor Michael Kelly (Agent Burke in Rise of the Beasts) is born.\n- 1973 — Lee Kye-yoon (Korean voice of Windblade) is born.\n- 1979 — Luiz Sérgio Vieira (Brazilian voice of Sqweeks) is born.\n- 1984 — The first-ever recorded mention of Transformers on the Internet is a less-than-glowing review of The Transformers #1.\n- 1987 — The Fight!

          "description": "A transformer is a passive component that transfers electrical energy from one electrical circuit to another circuit, or multiple circuits.",
          "content": "Transformer\nIn electrical engineering, a transformer is a passive component that transfers electrical energy from one electrical circuit to another circuit, or multiple circuits. A varying current in any coil of the transformer produces a varying magnetic flux in the transformer's core, which induces a varying electromotive force (EMF) across any other coils wound around the same core. Electrical energy can be transferred between separate coils without a metallic (conductive) connection between the two circuits. Faraday's law of induction, discovered in 1831, describes the induced voltage effect in any coil due to a changing magnetic flux encircled by the coil.\nTransformers are used to change AC voltage levels, such transformers being termed step-up or step-down type to increase or decrease voltage level, respectively. Transformers can also be used to provide galvanic isolation between circuits as well as to couple stages of signal-processing circuits. Since the invention of the first constant-potential transformer in 1885, transformers have become essential for the transmission, distribution, and utilization of alternating current electric power.[2] A wide range of transformer designs is encountered in electronic and electric power applications. Transformers range in size from RF transformers less than a cubic centimeter in volume, to units weighing hundreds of tons used to interconnect the power grid.\nPrinciples\n[edit]Ideal transformer equations\nBy Faraday's law of induction:\nwhere is the instantaneous voltage, is the number of turns in a winding, dΦ/dt is the derivative of the magnetic flux Φ through one turn of the winding over time (t), and subscripts P and S denotes primary and secondary.\nCombining the ratio of eq. 1 & eq. 2:\nwhere for a step-up transformer a < 1 and for a step-down transformer a > 1.[4]\nBy the law of conservation of energy, apparent, real and reactive power are each conserved in the input and output:\nwhere is apparent power and is current.\nCombining Eq. 3 & Eq. 4 with this endnote[b][5] gives the ideal transformer identity:\nwhere is the primary winding self-inductance and is the secondary winding self-inductance.\nBy Ohm's law and ideal transformer identity:\nwhere is the load impedance of the secondary circuit & is the apparent load or driving point impedance of the primary circuit, the superscript denoting referred to the primary.\nIdeal transformer\n[edit]An ideal transformer is linear, lossless and perfectly coupled. Perfect coupling implies infinitely high core magnetic permeability and winding inductance and zero net magnetomotive force (i.e. ipnp − isns = 0).[4][c]\nA varying current in the transformer's primary winding creates a varying magnetic flux in the transformer core, which is also encircled by the secondary winding. This varying flux at the secondary winding induces a varying electromotive force or voltage in the secondary winding. This electromagnetic induction phenomenon is the basis of transformer action and, in accordance with Lenz's law, the secondary current so produced creates a flux equal and opposite to that produced by the primary winding.\nThe windings are wound around a core of infinitely high magnetic permeability so that all of the magnetic flux passes through both the primary and secondary windings. With a voltage source connected to the primary winding and a load connected to the secondary winding, the transformer currents flow in the indicated directions and the core magnetomotive force cancels to zero.\nAccording to Faraday's law, since the same magnetic flux passes through both the primary and secondary windings in an ideal transformer, a voltage is induced in each winding proportional to its number of turns. The transformer winding voltage ratio is equal to the winding turns ratio.[7]\nAn ideal transformer is a reasonable approximation for a typical commercial transformer, with voltage ratio and winding turns ratio both being inversely proportional to the corresponding current ratio.\nThe load impedance referred to the primary circuit is equal to the turns ratio squared times the secondary circuit load impedance.[8]\nReal transformer\n[edit]Deviations from ideal transformer\n[edit]The ideal transformer model neglects many basic linear aspects of real transformers, including unavoidable losses and inefficiencies.[9]\n(a) Core losses, collectively called magnetizing current losses, consisting of[10]\n- Hysteresis losses due to nonlinear magnetic effects in the transformer core, and\n- Eddy current losses due to joule heating in the core that are proportional to the square of the transformer's applied voltage.\n(b) Unlike the ideal model, the windings in a real transformer have non-zero resistances and inductances associated with:\n- Joule losses due to resistance in the primary and secondary windings[10]\n- Leakage flux that escapes from the core and passes through one winding only resulting in primary and secondary reactive impedance.\n(c) similar to an inductor, parasitic capacitance and self-resonance phenomenon due to the electric field distribution. Three kinds of parasitic capacitance are usually considered and the closed-loop equations are provided[11]\n- Capacitance between adjacent turns in any one layer;\n- Capacitance between adjacent layers;\n- Capacitance between the core and the layer(s) adjacent to the core;\nInclusion of capacitance into the transformer model is complicated, and is rarely attempted; the 'real' transformer model's equivalent circuit shown below does not include parasitic capacitance. However, the capacitance effect can be measured by comparing open-circuit inductance, i.e. the inductance of a primary winding when the secondary circuit is open, to a short-circuit inductance when the secondary winding is shorted.\nLeakage flux\n[edit]The ideal transformer model assumes that all flux generated by the primary winding links all the turns of every winding, including itself. In practice, some flux traverses paths that take it outside the windings.[12] Such flux is termed leakage flux, and results in leakage inductance in series with the mutually coupled transformer windings.[13] Leakage flux results in energy being alternately stored in and discharged from the magnetic fields with each cycle of the power supply. It is not directly a power loss, but results in inferior voltage regulation, causing the secondary voltage not to be directly proportional to the primary voltage, particularly under heavy load.[12] Transformers are therefore normally designed to have very low leakage inductance.\nIn some applications increased leakage is desired, and long magnetic paths, air gaps, or magnetic bypass shunts may deliberately be introduced in a transformer design to limit the short-circuit current it will supply.[13] Leaky transformers may be used to supply loads that exhibit negative resistance, such as electric arcs, mercury- and sodium- vapor lamps and neon signs or for safely handling loads that become periodically short-circuited such as electric arc welders.[10]: 485\nAir gaps are also used to keep a transformer from saturating, especially audio-frequency transformers in circuits that have a DC component flowing in the windings.[14] A saturable reactor exploits saturation of the core to control alternating current.\nKnowledge of leakage inductance is also useful when transformers are operated in parallel. It can be shown that if the percent impedance[e] and associated winding leakage reactance-to-resistance (X/R) ratio of two transformers were the same, the transformers would share the load power in proportion to their respective ratings. However, the impedance tolerances of commercial transformers are significant. Also, the impedance and X/R ratio of different capacity transformers tends to vary.[16]\nEquivalent circuit\n[edit]Referring to the diagram, a practical transformer's physical behavior may be represented by an equivalent circuit model, which can incorporate an ideal transformer.[17]\nWinding joule losses and leakage reactance are represented by the following series loop impedances of the model:\n- Primary winding: RP, XP\n- Secondary winding: RS, XS.\nIn normal course of circuit equivalence transformation, RS and XS are in practice usually referred to the primary side by multiplying these impedances by the turns ratio squared, (NP/NS) 2 = a2.\nCore loss and reactance is represented by the following shunt leg impedances of the model:\n- Core or iron losses: RC\n- Magnetizing reactance: XM.\nRC and XM are collectively termed the magnetizing branch of the model.\nCore losses are caused mostly by hysteresis and eddy current effects in the core and are proportional to the square of the core flux for operation at a given frequency.[10]: 142–143 The finite permeability core requires a magnetizing current IM to maintain mutual flux in the core. Magnetizing current is in phase with the flux, the relationship between the two being non-linear due to saturation effects. However, all impedances of the equivalent circuit shown are by definition linear and such non-linearity effects are not typically reflected in transformer equivalent circuits.[10]: 142 With sinusoidal supply, core flux lags the induced EMF by 90°. With open-circuited secondary winding, magnetizing branch current I0 equals transformer no-load current.[17]\nThe resulting model, though sometimes termed 'exact' equivalent circuit based on linearity assumptions, retains a number of approximations.[17] Analysis may be simplified by assuming that magnetizing branch impedance is relatively high and relocating the branch to the left of the primary impedances. This introduces error but allows combination of primary and referred secondary resistances and reactance by simple summation as two series impedances.\nTransformer equivalent circuit impedance and transformer ratio parameters can be derived from the following tests: open-circuit test, short-circuit test, winding resistance test, and transformer ratio test.\nTransformer EMF equation\n[edit]If the flux in the core is purely sinusoidal, the relationship for either winding between its rms voltage Erms of the winding, and the supply frequency f, number of turns N, core cross-sectional area A in m2 and peak magnetic flux density Bpeak in Wb/m2 or T (tesla) is given by the universal EMF equation:[10]\nPolarity\n[edit]A dot convention is often used in transformer circuit diagrams, nameplates or terminal markings to define the relative polarity of transformer windings. Positively increasing instantaneous current entering the primary winding's 'dot' end induces positive polarity voltage exiting the secondary winding's 'dot' end. Three-phase transformers used in electric power systems will have a nameplate that indicate the phase relationships between their terminals. This may be in the form of a phasor diagram, or using an alpha-numeric code to show the type of internal connection (wye or delta) for each winding.\nEffect of frequency\n[edit]The EMF of a transformer at a given flux increases with frequency.[10] By operating at higher frequencies, transformers can be physically more compact because a given core is able to transfer more power without reaching saturation and fewer turns are needed to achieve the same impedance. However, properties such as core loss and conductor skin effect also increase with frequency. Aircraft and military equipment employ 400 Hz power supplies which reduce core and winding weight.[18] Conversely, frequencies used for some railway electrification systems were much lower (e.g. 16.7 Hz and 25 Hz) than normal utility frequencies (50–60 Hz) for historical reasons concerned mainly with the limitations of early electric traction motors. Consequently, the transformers used to step-down the high overhead line voltages were much larger and heavier for the same power rating than those required for the higher frequencies.\nOperation of a transformer at its designed voltage but at a higher frequency than intended will lead to reduced magnetizing current. At a lower frequency, the magnetizing current will increase. Operation of a large transformer at other than its design frequency may require assessment of voltages, losses, and cooling to establish if safe operation is practical. Transformers may require protective relays to protect the transformer from overvoltage at higher than rated frequency.\nOne example is in traction transformers used for electric multiple unit and high-speed train service operating across regions with different electrical standards. The converter equipment and traction transformers have to accommodate different input frequencies and voltage (ranging from as high as 50 Hz down to 16.7 Hz and rated up to 25 kV).\nAt much higher frequencies the transformer core size required drops dramatically: a physically small transformer can handle power levels that would require a massive iron core at mains frequency. The development of switching power semiconductor devices made switch-mode power supplies viable, to generate a high frequency, then change the voltage level with a small transformer.\nTransformers for higher frequency applications such as SMPS typically use core materials with much lower hysteresis and eddy-current losses than those for 50/60 Hz. Primary examples are iron-powder and ferrite cores. The lower frequency-dependant losses of these cores often is at the expense of flux density at saturation. For instance, ferrite saturation occurs at a substantially lower flux density than laminated iron.\nLarge power transformers are vulnerable to insulation failure due to transient voltages with high-frequency components, such as caused in switching or by lightning.\nEnergy losses\n[edit]Transformer energy losses are dominated by winding and core losses. Transformers' efficiency tends to improve with increasing transformer capacity.[19] The efficiency of typical distribution transformers is between about 98 and 99 percent.[19][20]\nAs transformer losses vary with load, it is often useful to tabulate no-load loss, full-load loss, half-load loss, and so on. Hysteresis and eddy current losses are constant at all load levels and dominate at no load, while winding loss increases as load increases. The no-load loss can be significant, so that even an idle transformer constitutes a drain on the electrical supply. Designing energy efficient transformers for lower loss requires a larger core, good-quality silicon steel, or even amorphous steel for the core and thicker wire, increasing initial cost. The choice of construction represents a trade-off between initial cost and operating cost.[21]\nTransformer losses arise from:\n- Winding joule losses\n- Current flowing through a winding's conductor causes joule heating due to the resistance of the wire. As frequency increases, skin effect and proximity effect causes the winding's resistance and, hence, losses to increase.\n- Core losses\n-\n- Hysteresis losses\n- Each time the magnetic field is reversed, a small amount of energy is lost due to hysteresis within the core, caused by motion of the magnetic domains within the steel. According to Steinmetz's formula, the heat energy due to hysteresis is given by\n- and,\n- hysteresis loss is thus given by\n- where, f is the frequency, η is the hysteresis coefficient and βmax is the maximum flux density, the empirical exponent of which varies from about 1.4 to 1.8 but is often given as 1.6 for iron.[21] For more detailed analysis, see Magnetic core and Steinmetz's equation.\n- Eddy current losses\n- Eddy currents are induced in the conductive metal transformer core by the changing magnetic field, and this current flowing through the resistance of the iron dissipates energy as heat in the core. The eddy current loss is a complex function of the square of supply frequency and inverse square of the material thickness.[21] Eddy current losses can be reduced by making the core of a stack of laminations (thin plates) electrically insulated from each other, rather than a solid block; all transformers operating at low frequencies use laminated or similar cores.\n- Magnetostriction related transformer hum\n- Magnetic flux in a ferromagnetic material, such as the core, causes it to physically expand and contract slightly with each cycle of the magnetic field, an effect known as magnetostriction, the frictional energy of which produces an audible noise known as mains hum or \"transformer hum\".[22] This transformer hum is especially objectionable in transformers supplied at power frequencies and in high-frequency flyback transformers associated with television CRTs.\n- Stray losses\n- Leakage inductance is by itself largely lossless, since energy supplied to its magnetic fields is returned to the supply with the next half-cycle. However, any leakage flux that intercepts nearby conductive materials such as the transformer's support structure will give rise to eddy currents and be converted to heat.[23]\n- Radiative\n- There are also radiative losses due to the oscillating magnetic field but these are usually small.\n- Mechanical vibration and audible noise transmission\n- In addition to magnetostriction, the alternating magnetic field causes fluctuating forces between the primary and secondary windings. This energy incites vibration transmission in interconnected metalwork, thus amplifying audible transformer hum.[24]\nConstruction\n[edit]Cores\n[edit]Closed-core transformers are constructed in 'core form' or 'shell form'. When windings surround the core, the transformer is core form; when windings are surrounded by the core, the transformer is shell form.[25] Shell form design may be more prevalent than core form design for distribution transformer applications due to the relative ease in stacking the core around winding coils.[25] Core form design tends to, as a general rule, be more economical, and therefore more prevalent, than shell form design for high voltage power transformer applications at the lower end of their voltage and power rating ranges (less than or equal to, nominally, 230 kV or 75 MVA). At higher voltage and power ratings, shell form transformers tend to be more prevalent.[25][26][27] Shell form design tends to be preferred for extra-high voltage and higher MVA applications because, though more labor-intensive to manufacture, shell form transformers are characterized as having inherently better kVA-to-weight ratio, better short-circuit strength characteristics and higher immunity to transit damage.[27]\nLaminated steel cores\n[edit]Transformers for use at power or audio frequencies typically have cores made of high permeability silicon steel.[28] The steel has a permeability many times that of free space and the core thus serves to greatly reduce the magnetizing current and confine the flux to a path which closely couples the windings.[29] Early transformer developers soon realized that cores constructed from solid iron resulted in prohibitive eddy current losses, and their designs mitigated this effect with cores consisting of bundles of insulated iron wires.[30] Later designs constructed the core by stacking layers of thin steel laminations, a principle that has remained in use. Each lamination is insulated from its neighbors by a thin non-conducting layer of insulation.[31] The transformer universal EMF equation can be used to calculate the core cross-sectional area for a preferred level of magnetic flux.[10]\nThe effect of laminations is to confine eddy currents to highly elliptical paths that enclose little flux, and so reduce their magnitude. Thinner laminations reduce losses,[28] but are more laborious and expensive to construct.[32] Thin laminations are generally used on high-frequency transformers, with some of very thin steel laminations able to operate up to 10 kHz.\nOne common design of laminated core is made from interleaved stacks of E-shaped steel sheets capped with I-shaped pieces, leading to its name of E-I transformer.[32] Such a design tends to exhibit more losses, but is very economical to manufacture. The cut-core or C-core type is made by winding a steel strip around a rectangular form and then bonding the layers together. It is then cut in two, forming two C shapes, and the core assembled by binding the two C halves together with a steel strap.[32] They have the advantage that the flux is always oriented parallel to the metal grains, reducing reluctance.\nA steel core's remanence means that it retains a static magnetic field when power is removed. When power is then reapplied, the residual field will cause a high inrush current until the effect of the remaining magnetism is reduced, usually after a few cycles of the applied AC waveform.[33] Overcurrent protection devices such as fuses must be selected to allow this harmless inrush to pass.\nOn transformers connected to long, overhead power transmission lines, induced currents due to geomagnetic disturbances during solar storms can cause saturation of the core and operation of transformer protection devices.[34]\nDistribution transformers can achieve low no-load losses by using cores made with low-loss high-permeability silicon steel or amorphous (non-crystalline) metal alloy. The higher initial cost of the core material is offset over the life of the transformer by its lower losses at light load.[35]\nSolid cores\n[edit]Powdered iron cores are used in circuits such as switch-mode power supplies that operate above mains frequencies and up to a few tens of kilohertz. These materials combine high magnetic permeability with high bulk electrical resistivity. For frequencies extending beyond the VHF band, cores made from non-conductive magnetic ceramic materials called ferrites are common.[32] Some radio-frequency transformers also have movable cores (sometimes called 'slugs') which allow adjustment of the coupling coefficient (and bandwidth) of tuned radio-frequency circuits.\nToroidal cores\n[edit]Toroidal transformers are built around a ring-shaped core, which, depending on operating frequency, is made from a long strip of silicon steel or permalloy wound into a coil, powdered iron, or ferrite.[36] A strip construction ensures that the grain boundaries are optimally aligned, improving the transformer's efficiency by reducing the core's reluctance. The closed ring shape eliminates air gaps inherent in the construction of an E-I core.[10] : 485 The cross-section of the ring is usually square or rectangular, but more expensive cores with circular cross-sections are also available. The primary and secondary coils are often wound concentrically to cover the entire surface of the core. This minimizes the length of wire needed and provides screening to minimize the core's magnetic field from generating electromagnetic interference.\nToroidal transformers are more efficient than the cheaper laminated E-I types for a similar power level. Other advantages compared to E-I types, include smaller size (about half), lower weight (about half), less mechanical hum (making them superior in audio amplifiers), lower exterior magnetic field (about one tenth), low off-load losses (making them more efficient in standby circuits), single-bolt mounting, and greater choice of shapes. The main disadvantages are higher cost and limited power capacity (see Classification parameters below). Because of the lack of a residual gap in the magnetic path, toroidal transformers also tend to exhibit higher inrush current, compared to laminated E-I types.\nFerrite toroidal cores are used at higher frequencies, typically between a few tens of kilohertz to hundreds of megahertz, to reduce losses, physical size, and weight of inductive components. A drawback of toroidal transformer construction is the higher labor cost of winding. This is because it is necessary to pass the entire length of a coil winding through the core aperture each time a single turn is added to the coil. As a consequence, toroidal transformers rated more than a few kVA are uncommon. Relatively few toroids are offered with power ratings above 10 kVA, and practically none above 25 kVA. Small distribution transformers may achieve some of the benefits of a toroidal core by splitting it and forcing it open, then inserting a bobbin containing primary and secondary windings.[37]\nAir cores\n[edit]A transformer can be produced by placing the windings near each other, an arrangement termed an \"air-core\" transformer. An air-core transformer eliminates loss due to hysteresis in the core material.[13] The magnetizing inductance is drastically reduced by the lack of a magnetic core, resulting in large magnetizing currents and losses if used at low frequencies. Air-core transformers are unsuitable for use in power distribution,[13] but are frequently employed in radio-frequency applications.[38] Air cores are also used for resonant transformers such as tesla coils, where they can achieve reasonably low loss despite the low magnetizing inductance.\nWindings\n[edit]The electrical conductor used for the windings depends upon the application, but in all cases the individual turns must be electrically insulated from each other to ensure that the current travels throughout every turn. For small transformers, in which currents are low and the potential difference between adjacent turns is small, the coils are often wound from enameled magnet wire. Larger power transformers may be wound with copper rectangular strip conductors insulated by oil-impregnated paper and blocks of pressboard.[39]\nHigh-frequency transformers operating in the tens to hundreds of kilohertz often have windings made of braided Litz wire to minimize the skin-effect and proximity effect losses.[40] Large power transformers use multiple-stranded conductors as well, since even at low power frequencies non-uniform distribution of current would otherwise exist in high-current windings.[39] Each strand is individually insulated, and the strands are arranged so that at certain points in the winding, or throughout the whole winding, each portion occupies different relative positions in the complete conductor. The transposition equalizes the current flowing in each strand of the conductor, and reduces eddy current losses in the winding itself. The stranded conductor is also more flexible than a solid conductor of similar size, aiding manufacture.[39]\nThe windings of signal transformers minimize leakage inductance and stray capacitance to improve high-frequency response. Coils are split into sections, and those sections interleaved between the sections of the other winding.\nPower-frequency transformers may have taps at intermediate points on the winding, usually on the higher voltage winding side, for voltage adjustment. Taps may be manually reconnected, or a manual or automatic switch may be provided for changing taps. Automatic on-load tap changers are used in electric power transmission or distribution, on equipment such as arc furnace transformers, or for automatic voltage regulators for sensitive loads. Audio-frequency transformers, used for the distribution of audio to public address loudspeakers, have taps to allow adjustment of impedance to each speaker. A center-tapped transformer is often used in the output stage of an audio power amplifier in a push-pull circuit. Modulation transformers in AM transmitters are very similar.\nCooling\n[edit]It is a rule of thumb that the life expectancy of electrical insulation is halved for about every 7 °C to 10 °C increase in operating temperature (an instance of the application of the Arrhenius equation).[41]\nSmall dry-type and liquid-immersed transformers are often self-cooled by natural convection and radiation heat dissipation. As power ratings increase, transformers are often cooled by forced-air cooling, forced-oil cooling, water-cooling, or combinations of these.[42] Large transformers are filled with transformer oil that both cools and insulates the windings.[43] Transformer oil is often a highly refined mineral oil that cools the windings and insulation by circulating within the transformer tank. The mineral oil and paper insulation system has been extensively studied and used for more than 100 years. It is estimated that 50% of power transformers will survive 50 years of use, that the average age of failure of power transformers is about 10 to 15 years, and that about 30% of power transformer failures are due to insulation and overloading failures.[44][45] Prolonged operation at elevated temperature degrades insulating properties of winding insulation and dielectric coolant, which not only shortens transformer life but can ultimately lead to catastrophic transformer failure.[41] With a great body of empirical study as a guide, transformer oil testing including dissolved gas analysis provides valuable maintenance information.\nBuilding regulations in many jurisdictions require indoor liquid-filled transformers to either use dielectric fluids that are less flammable than oil, or be installed in fire-resistant rooms.[19] Air-cooled dry transformers can be more economical where they eliminate the cost of a fire-resistant transformer room.\nThe tank of liquid-filled transformers often has radiators through which the liquid coolant circulates by natural convection or fins. Some large transformers employ electric fans for forced-air cooling, pumps for forced-liquid cooling, or have heat exchangers for water-cooling.[43] An oil-immersed transformer may be equipped with a Buchholz relay, which, depending on severity of gas accumulation due to internal arcing, is used to either trigger an alarm or de-energize the transformer.[33] Oil-immersed transformer installations usually include fire protection measures such as walls, oil containment, and fire-suppression sprinkler systems.\nPolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have properties that once favored their use as a dielectric coolant, though concerns over their environmental persistence led to a widespread ban on their use.[46] Today, non-toxic, stable silicone-based oils, or fluorinated hydrocarbons may be used where the expense of a fire-resistant liquid offsets additional building cost for a transformer vault.[19][47] However, the long life span of transformers can mean that the potential for exposure can be high long after banning.[48]\nSome transformers are gas-insulated. Their windings are enclosed in sealed, pressurized tanks and often cooled by nitrogen or sulfur hexafluoride gas.[47]\nExperimental power transformers in the 500–1,000 kVA range have been built with liquid nitrogen or helium cooled superconducting windings, which eliminates winding losses without affecting core losses.[49][50]\nInsulation\n[edit]Insulation must be provided between the individual turns of the windings, between the windings, between windings and core, and at the terminals of the winding.\nInter-turn insulation of small transformers may be a layer of insulating varnish on the wire. Layer of paper or polymer films may be inserted between layers of windings, and between primary and secondary windings. A transformer may be coated or dipped in a polymer resin to improve the strength of windings and protect them from moisture or corrosion. The resin may be impregnated into the winding insulation using combinations of vacuum and pressure during the coating process, eliminating all air voids in the winding. In the limit, the entire coil may be placed in a mold, and resin cast around it as a solid block, encapsulating the windings.[51]\nLarge oil-filled power transformers use windings wrapped with insulating paper, which is impregnated with oil during assembly of the transformer. Oil-filled transformers use highly refined mineral oil to insulate and cool the windings and core. Construction of oil-filled transformers requires that the insulation covering the windings be thoroughly dried of residual moisture before the oil is introduced. Drying may be done by circulating hot air around the core, by circulating externally heated transformer oil, or by vapor-phase drying (VPD) where an evaporated solvent transfers heat by condensation on the coil and core. For small transformers, resistance heating by injection of current into the windings is used.\nBushings\n[edit]Larger transformers are provided with high-voltage insulated bushings made of polymers or porcelain. A large bushing can be a complex structure since it must provide careful control of the electric field gradient without letting the transformer leak oil.[52]\nClassification parameters\n[edit]Transformers can be classified in many ways, such as the following:\n- Power rating: From a fraction of a volt-ampere (VA) to over a thousand MVA.\n- Duty of a transformer: Continuous, short-time, intermittent, periodic, varying.\n- Frequency range: Power-frequency, audio-frequency, or radio-frequency.\n- Voltage class: From a few volts to hundreds of kilovolts.\n- Cooling type: Dry or liquid-immersed; self-cooled, forced air-cooled;forced oil-cooled, water-cooled.\n- Application: power supply, impedance matching, output voltage and current stabilizer, pulse, circuit isolation, power distribution, rectifier, arc furnace, amplifier output, etc..\n- Basic magnetic form: Core form, shell form, concentric, sandwich.\n- Constant-potential transformer descriptor: Step-up, step-down, isolation.\n- General winding configuration: By IEC vector group, two-winding combinations of the phase designations delta, wye or star, and zigzag; autotransformer, Scott-T\n- Rectifier phase-shift winding configuration: 2-winding, 6-pulse; 3-winding, 12-pulse; . . ., n-winding, [n − 1]·6-pulse; polygon; etc.\n- K-factor: A measure of how well the transformer can withstand harmonic loads.[53]\nApplications\n[edit]Various specific electrical application designs require a variety of transformer types. Although they all share the basic characteristic transformer principles, they are customized in construction or electrical properties for certain installation requirements or circuit conditions.\nIn electric power transmission, transformers allow transmission of electric power at high voltages, which reduces the loss due to heating of the wires. This allows generating plants to be located economically at a distance from electrical consumers.[54] All but a tiny fraction of the world's electrical power has passed through a series of transformers by the time it reaches the consumer.[23]\nIn many electronic devices, a transformer is used to convert voltage from the distribution wiring to convenient values for the circuit requirements, either directly at the power line frequency or through a switch mode power supply.\nSignal and audio transformers are used to couple stages of amplifiers and to match devices such as microphones and record players to the input of amplifiers. Audio transformers allowed telephone circuits to carry on a two-way conversation over a single pair of wires. A balun transformer converts a signal that is referenced to ground to a signal that has balanced voltages to ground, such as between external cables and internal circuits. Isolation transformers prevent leakage of current into the secondary circuit and are used in medical equipment and at construction sites. Resonant transformers are used for coupling between stages of radio receivers, or in high-voltage Tesla coils.\nHistory\n[edit]Discovery of induction\n[edit]Electromagnetic induction, the principle of the operation of the transformer, was discovered independently by Michael Faraday in 1831 and Joseph Henry in 1832.[56][57][58][59] Only Faraday furthered his experiments to the point of working out the equation describing the relationship between EMF and magnetic flux now known as Faraday's law of induction:\nwhere is the magnitude of the EMF in volts and ΦB is the magnetic flux through the circuit in webers.[60]\nFaraday performed early experiments on induction between coils of wire, including winding a pair of coils around an iron ring, thus creating the first toroidal closed-core transformer.[59][61] However he only applied individual pulses of current to his transformer, and never discovered the relation between the turns ratio and EMF in the windings.\nInduction coils\n[edit]The first type of transformer to see wide use was the induction coil, invented by Irish-Catholic Rev. Nicholas Callan of Maynooth College, Ireland in 1836.[59] He was one of the first researchers to realize the more turns the secondary winding has in relation to the primary winding, the larger the induced secondary EMF will be. Induction coils evolved from scientists' and inventors' efforts to get higher voltages from batteries. Since batteries produce direct current (DC) rather than AC, induction coils relied upon vibrating electrical contacts that regularly interrupted the current in the primary to create the flux changes necessary for induction. Between the 1830s and the 1870s, efforts to build better induction coils, mostly by trial and error, slowly revealed the basic principles of transformers.\nFirst alternating current transformers\n[edit]By the 1870s, efficient generators producing alternating current (AC) were available, and it was found AC could power an induction coil directly, without an interrupter.\nIn 1876, Russian engineer Pavel Yablochkov invented a lighting system based on a set of induction coils where the primary windings were connected to a source of AC. The secondary windings could be connected to several 'electric candles' (arc lamps) of his own design. The coils Yablochkov employed functioned essentially as transformers.[62]\nIn 1878, the Ganz factory, Budapest, Hungary, began producing equipment for electric lighting and, by 1883, had installed over fifty systems in Austria-Hungary. Their AC systems used arc and incandescent lamps, generators, and other equipment.[59][63]\nIn 1882, Lucien Gaulard and John Dixon Gibbs first exhibited a device with an initially widely criticized laminated plate open iron core called a 'secondary generator' in London, then sold the idea to the Westinghouse company in the United States in 1886.[30] They also exhibited the invention in Turin, Italy in 1884, where it was highly successful and adopted for an electric lighting system.[64] Their open-core device used a fixed 1:1 ratio to supply a series circuit for the utilization load (lamps). However, the voltage of their system was controlled by moving the iron core in or out.[65]\nEarly series circuit transformer distribution\n[edit]Induction coils with open magnetic circuits are inefficient at transferring power to loads. Until about 1880, the paradigm for AC power transmission from a high voltage supply to a low voltage load was a series circuit. Open-core transformers with a ratio near 1:1 were connected with their primaries in series to allow use of a high voltage for transmission while presenting a low voltage to the lamps. The inherent flaw in this method was that turning off a single lamp (or other electric device) affected the voltage supplied to all others on the same circuit. Many adjustable transformer designs were introduced to compensate for this problematic characteristic of the series circuit, including those employing methods of adjusting the core or bypassing the magnetic flux around part of a coil.[64] Efficient, practical transformer designs did not appear until the 1880s, but within a decade, the transformer would be instrumental in the war of the currents, and in seeing AC distribution systems triumph over their DC counterparts, a position in which they have remained dominant ever since.[66]\nClosed-core transformers and parallel power distribution\n[edit]In the autumn of 1884, Károly Zipernowsky, Ottó Bláthy and Miksa Déri (ZBD), three Hungarian engineers associated with the Ganz Works, had determined that open-core devices were impracticable, as they were incapable of reliably regulating voltage.[63] The Ganz factory had also in the autumn of 1884 made delivery of the world's first five high-efficiency AC transformers, the first of these units having been shipped on September 16, 1884.[67] This first unit had been manufactured to the following specifications: 1,400 W, 40 Hz, 120:72 V, 11.6:19.4 A, ratio 1.67:1, one-phase, shell form.[67] In their joint 1885 patent applications for novel transformers (later called ZBD transformers), they described two designs with closed magnetic circuits where copper windings were either wound around an iron wire ring core or surrounded by an iron wire core.[64] The two designs were the first application of the two basic transformer constructions in common use to this day, termed \"core form\" or \"shell form\" .[68]\nIn both designs, the magnetic flux linking the primary and secondary windings traveled almost entirely within the confines of the iron core, with no intentional path through air (see Toroidal cores below). The new transformers were 3.4 times more efficient than the open-core bipolar devices of Gaulard and Gibbs.[69] The ZBD patents included two other major interrelated innovations: one concerning the use of parallel connected, instead of series connected, utilization loads, the other concerning the ability to have high turns ratio transformers such that the supply network voltage could be much higher (initially 1,400 to 2,000 V) than the voltage of utilization loads (100 V initially preferred).[70][71] When employed in parallel connected electric distribution systems, closed-core transformers finally made it technically and economically feasible to provide electric power for lighting in homes, businesses and public spaces. Bláthy had suggested the use of closed cores, Zipernowsky had suggested the use of parallel shunt connections, and Déri had performed the experiments;[72] In early 1885, the three engineers also eliminated the problem of eddy current losses with the invention of the lamination of electromagnetic cores.[73]\nTransformers today are designed on the principles discovered by the three engineers. They also popularized the word 'transformer' to describe a device for altering the EMF of an electric current[74] although the term had already been in use by 1882.[75][76] In 1886, the ZBD engineers designed, and the Ganz factory supplied electrical equipment for, the world's first power station that used AC generators to power a parallel connected common electrical network, the steam-powered Rome-Cerchi power plant.[77]\nWestinghouse improvements\n[edit]Building on the advancement of AC technology in Europe,[78] George Westinghouse founded the Westinghouse Electric in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on January 8, 1886.[79] The new firm became active in developing alternating current (AC) electric infrastructure throughout the United States. The Edison Electric Light Company held an option on the US rights for the ZBD transformers, requiring Westinghouse to pursue alternative designs on the same principles. George Westinghouse had bought Gaulard and Gibbs' patents for $50,000 in February 1886.[80] He assigned to William Stanley the task of redesign the Gaulard and Gibbs transformer for commercial use in United States.[81] Stanley's first patented design was for induction coils with single cores of soft iron and adjustable gaps to regulate the EMF present in the secondary winding (see image). This design[82] was first used commercially in the US in 1886[83] but Westinghouse was intent on improving the Stanley design to make it (unlike the ZBD type) easy and cheap to produce.[82]\nWestinghouse, Stanley and associates soon developed a core that was easier to manufacture, consisting of a stack of thin 'E‑shaped' iron plates insulated by thin sheets of paper or other insulating material. Pre-wound copper coils could then be slid into place, and straight iron plates laid in to create a closed magnetic circuit. Westinghouse obtained a patent for the new low-cost design in 1887.[72]\nOther early transformer designs\n[edit]In 1889, Russian-born engineer Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky developed the first three-phase transformer at the Allgemeine Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft ('General Electricity Company') in Germany.[84]\nIn 1891, Nikola Tesla invented the Tesla coil, an air-cored, dual-tuned resonant transformer for producing very high voltages at high frequency.[85]\nAudio frequency transformers (\"repeating coils\") were used by early experimenters in the development of the telephone.[86]\nSee also\n[edit]Notes\n[edit]- ^ With turns of the winding oriented perpendicularly to the magnetic field lines, the flux is the product of the magnetic flux density and the core area, the magnetic field varying with time according to the excitation of the primary. The expression , defined as the derivative of magnetic flux with time , provides a measure of rate of magnetic flux in the core and hence of EMF induced in the respective winding. The negative sign in eq. 1 & eq. 2 is consistent with Lenz's law and Faraday's law in that by convention EMF \"induced by an increase of magnetic flux linkages is opposite to the direction that would be given by the right-hand rule.\"\n- ^ Although ideal transformer's winding inductances are each infinitely high, the square root of winding inductances' ratio is equal to the turns ratio.\n- ^ This also implies the following: The net core flux is zero, the input impedance is infinite when secondary is open and zero when secondary is shorted; there is zero phase-shift through an ideal transformer; input and output power and reactive volt-ampere are each conserved; these three statements apply for any frequency above zero and periodic waveforms are conserved.[6]\n- ^ Direction of transformer currents is according to the Right-Hand Rule.\n- ^ Percent impedance is the ratio of the voltage drop in the secondary from no load to full load.[15]\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ \"Archives Michael Faraday biography – The IET\". theiet.org.\n- ^ Bedell, Frederick (1942). \"History of A-C Wave Form, Its Determination and Standardization\".

Optimus Prime transforms into a 1994 red and blue Peterbilt 379 semi-trailer truck in the first three films, a rusty 1973 Marmon HDT-AC 86 semi cab-over truck in the beginning of the fourth film, and later a blue and red 2014 Western Star 5700XE Phantom semi-truck.\nIn the first film, Optimus Prime arrives on Earth with Ratchet, Ironhide, and Jazz trying to find the AllSpark. At Mission City, he kills Bonecrusher and battles Megatron, but Sam pushes the AllSpark into Megatron's chest, killing him and destroying the cube; as a result, Cybertron can no longer be restored. Afterward, Optimus and the other Autobots form an alliance with the humans and work closely with them, with the resulting alliance being called NEST.\nIn Revenge of the Fallen, Optimus is killed by Megatron during a battle with him, Starscream, and Grindor. Near the end of the film, he is revived by Sam with the Matrix of Leadership and is fused with Jetfire, making him more powerful. Optimus Prime then faces the Fallen and Megatron. After a vicious fight, Optimus severely wounds Megatron and kills the Fallen, telling him to \"give me your face.\"\nIn Dark of the Moon, Optimus revives Sentinel Prime using the Matrix of Leadership and reveals he was the leader of the Autobots before him. However, Sentinel betrays the Autobots and joins the Decepticons to restore Cybertron with the Pillars; meanwhile, the Autobots are sent into space. During the battle in Chicago, Optimus kills some Decepticons, including the Driller, Shockwave, and Megatron before he kills Sentinel Prime. In the film, Optimus is depicted with a trailer similar to his Generation 1 counterpart,[1] and has been redesigned to look more heroic.[2] The trailer contains enhanced weapons and flight gear. Optimus loses his right arm to Sentinel Prime at the film's climax.\nIn Age of Extinction, he is hunted by Harold Attinger, Cemetery Wind, and Lockdown, who is working for the Creators to bring him to Cybertron and kill any Autobots who refuse to give up his location. A badly wounded Optimus is discovered by struggling inventor Cade Yeager, who shelters him. Escaping the eyes of Cemetery Wind, Optimus leads the Autobots once again, taming the Dinobots and rides Grimlock to fight Galvatron and his new army of man-made Transformers. After defeating Galvatron's army, he kills Attinger and Lockdown. He sets the Dinobots free and asks his fellow Autobots to protect Cade and his family before taking the Seed into space and going after the Creators. At the start of the movie, Optimus uses a mode similar to his G1 counterpart but with a lot of rust.\nIn The Last Knight, Optimus arrives at Cybertron, now a dead planet. He finds Quintessa, the Prime of Life, who brainwashes Optimus to do her bidding of destroying the Earth, which she reveals is an ancient enemy planet, Unicron. She tells Prime that he must retrieve her staff to rebuild Cybertron. Prime's eyes turn purple and becomes Nemesis Prime under Quintessa's control. Just as he is about to kill Bumblebee, Bee speaks for the first time in ten years, which causes him to return to normal. He rides Dragonstorm into battle. After defeating Quintessa and saving both worlds, Optimus and the Autobots return to Cybertron, which has joined with the Earth into one planet.\nOptimus Prime reappears and appears similar to his G1 counterpart in Bumblebee. He leads the Autobots against the Decepticons trying to take over Cybertron, but is forced to retreat when Decepticon reinforcements led by Soundwave and Shockwave attack them. Realizing that Cybertron has fallen, he orders all Autobots to get to their escape pods. He gives Bumblebee the task to protect the Earth and set up a base for them before being attacked by Ravage and other Decepticons.\nIn Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, Optimus Prime reappears and appears similar to his G1 counterpart; he transforms into a Freightliner FLA-8664T semi-trailer truck, a form which he gained previously in Bumblebee. Optimus and his fellow Autobots had been hiding for the past seven years, waiting for a means to return to Cybertron. When the signal of a Transwarp Key is activated in Brooklyn, he rallies the other Autobots to investigate the signal, with Mirage bringing in a civilian named Noah Diaz. Despite Bumblebee's earlier encounter with a human, Optimus is distrustful of human help. Optimus comes face-to-face with the Terrorcons' leader, Scourge, who defeats him in combat. Optimus witnesses the deactivation of Bumblebee, making it his mission to avenge his fallen comrade. Bumblebee, who would be revived by an infusion of raw Energon, would be avenged as Optimus disarms Scourge and rips out his head, destroying the Transwarp Key to stop Unicron's advance.\nBumblebee\n[edit]Bumblebee (voiced by Dylan O'Brien in Bumblebee, Mark Ryan in the 2007 film and the second video game, Ben Schwartz in Age of Extinction,[3] Erik Aadahl in The Last Knight, Fred Tatasciore in the third video game) is an Autobot scout, Hot Rod's brother-in-arms, and Sam's former guardian in the first three films, and later becomes Optimus' second-in-command in the following two. due to his voicebox being damaged during the battle for Cybertron, he's hardly able to speak, only able to communicate through radio recordings and recorded movie and song quotes. Bumblebee transforms into various types of Chevrolet Camaros; the first four films depict him as fifth generation Camaros before switching to a sixth generation in The Last Knight. Bumblebee depicts him as a Volkswagen Beetle, and Rise of the Beasts depicts him as a second-generation Camaro.\nIn Transformers, Sam Witwicky purchases a dirty 1977 Chevrolet Camaro, but it reveals it's actually an Autobot, Bumblebee. Later Bumblebee turns into a 2007 Chevrolet Camaro. Bumblebee is wounded during the battle at Mission City, though is able to defeat Brawl with Mikaela's help.

In defiance of the Primes' rule, Never destroy a planet with life, the Fallen sets about building a Star Harvester on Earth, which would destroy both the planet and its sun. To do this, he steals the Matrix of Leadership - the only thing that can turn on such a machine - but his brothers stop him, retrieve the Matrix, and hide it from him. Years after his betrayal, he is found on the Nemesis, which had crash-landed on one of Saturn's moons, in suspended animation. He can open Space Bridges at will and has telekinesis, powers that are restricted to the original Dynasty of Primes. He wields a void scepter as a melee weapon.[14] In the film, the Fallen seeks to invade the Earth with an army of Decepticons and activate the Star Harvester for an alternative Energon source, as well as get revenge on humanity and the Autobots. He lands on Earth and uses the Earth's telecommunications grid (being hijacked by Megatron and Soundwave) to force the humans to hand over Sam Witwicky in order to guide the Decepticons to the Matrix of Leadership. In the final battle, the Fallen steals the Matrix from a revived Optimus Prime and starts up the Star Harvester. As the Star Harvester charges, Jetfire sacrifices himself to let Optimus utilize his components.

Megatron is disappointed to learn that the AllSpark is with the humans and berates his lieutenant for his failure, while ordering him to retrieve it. He briefly assists the Decepticons' efforts in Mission City and would retreat when Megatron is killed. In Revenge of the Fallen, Starscream oversees Megatron's return but is berated for attempting to take command. He and the Fallen are worried about the Decepticon hatchlings, who are dying without Energon. Starscream would try to assist Megatron in his fight against Optimus Prime, but his arm is cut off. Megatron berates Starscream for failing to find Sam as he attempts to fix his arm. He is then seen attacking the Autobots and the humans as they head towards Egypt. He informs Megatron when Optimus' body is brought back and later takes part in the attack with the other Decepticon forces.

After being reprimanded by his dark master for letting the Maximals get away with the Transwarp Key, Scourge vowed to search the entire universe for the key.\nIn 1994, Scourge lands on Earth, alongside his fellow Terrorcons: Battletrap and Nightbird, after having detected the Transwarp Key's energy signature from a museum in Brooklyn, New York. Upon arriving at the museum, Scourge sends two of his Freezers to retrieve the key from two humans: Noah Diaz and Elena Wallace. Soon enough, the Autobots, led by Optimus Prime, arrive on the scene and a grueling battle ensues, with the Terrorcons proving resistant to damage due to being infused with Unicron's dark energy.

A training exercise he leads is interrupted by Bumblebee's arrival on Earth, which Burns interprets as a hostile action. Before Bumblebee can explain himself he and Burns's team are ambushed by Blitzwing, knocking Burns out and damaging Bumblebee's voice box and memory cells. Seeing Bumblebee walk away from the fight, Burns develops an intense vendetta against the Autobot, and later expresses suspicion of the Decepticons' intentions when they arrive on Earth, questioning their intentions based on their name alone. Although he spends much of the film expressing prejudice against Bumblebee and openly claiming he wants to tear him apart, he realises he'd misjudged harshly after Bumblebee saves him and helps him escape before the rest of the army arrives.\nNEST\n[edit]The Non-biological Extraterrestrial Species Treaty (or NEST for short) is a team of soldiers led by Lennox and Epps who help Sam in Revenge of the Fallen and Dark of the Moon.

They are asked to hunt down the Decepticons only, but without the President and their own agency's knowledge, Cemetery Wind also tries eliminating the Autobots due to Attinger's belief that all Transformers were menaces to humanity, no matter their faction. After the final battle of Hong Kong and Attinger and Savoy's deaths, Cemetery Wind is disbanded for military crimes and was replaced with the TRF after Lockdown's death.\n- Harold Attinger (portrayed by Kelsey Grammer) is the main antagonist of the Transformers: Age of Extinction movie. Harold is an ultranationalist and xenophobic CIA official who is the founder of the black ops division Cemetery Wind and an ally to Lockdown. He harbors deep hatred towards both Autobots and Decepticons, believing them to be an overall threat. Later in the battle of Hong Kong, he tries to kill Cade who he sees as a traitor only to be shot by Optimus Prime for his treason. His corpse was blown to ashes after Optimus used Lockdown's grenade to destroy the remaining KSI drones.\n- James Savoy (portrayed by Titus Welliver) is a corrupt field leader of Cemetery Wind and second in-command to Attinger. He is killed by Cade Yeager, who knocks him off a building during their fight. His corpse was sucked by Lockdown's ship and devoured by his henchman when using the giant magnet.\nTRF\n[edit]The Transformers Reaction Force (or TRF for short) is an international military organization that seeks to eradicate all Transformers, both Autobots and Decepticons, hiding on Earth. TRF is created from the remnants of the rogue CIA unit Cemetery Wind, as well as from the remnants of military unit, NEST. They are willing to kill any allies and sympathizers among humans that the Cybertronians might have, such as Cade Yeager, Viviane Wembly, or Edmund Burton. Events cause TRF to create an alliance to the Autobots and Cade to save the Earth from Quintessa. After she is defeated, the former TRF members watch as the Autobots head to Cybertron to rebuild it and the TRF was dissolved.\n- Santos (portrayed by Santiago Cabrera) is the commander of the TRF and a former Delta Force Operator and the major antagonist and anti-hero of the Transformers: The Last Knight movie. He born in São Paulo, Brazil, and grew up in Phoenix, Arizona. He seeks to destroy all remaining Cybertronians left on Earth as he believes them to be a threat. When learning that Cade is hiding Autobots, he sets out on a mission to arrest him. He tried to kill Optimus but is injured when his shot is deflected back. However, he redeems himself after Cade shames him for betraying the Autobots and helps the Autobots prevent Quintessa and the Decepticons from destroying Earth. He also reveals that the HMS Alliance submarine is a female Autobot.\nKSI\n[edit]Kinetic Solutions Incorporated (or KSI for short) is the robotics company who works Cemetery Wind and builds the remote control Transformers in Chicago, later Beijing. After the battle in Hong Kong, KSI stops production of its remote control Transformers.\n- Joshua Joyce (portrayed by Stanley Tucci) is a cynical and arrogant CEO of KSI who wants to build his own Transformers.[63][64][65] He realizes that Megatron had been using his technology to improve himself and the other Decepticons.

Joe\n[edit]- Agent Burke (portrayed by Michael Kelly) is the recruiter who recruited Noah Díaz.\nOther Cybertronians\n[edit]- Dynasty of Primes (three of them voiced by Michael York, Kevin Michael Richardson, Robin Atkin Downes) - Six of the Seven Primes and the overarching protagonists of the Transformers franchise. The Seven Primes are the first Cybertronians who travelled to distant galaxies looking for planets where they could build Star Harvesters. It was during the Dynasty's rule that Star Harvesters were not to be used in containing life. In 17,000 B.C.E., one of them defied the rule by powering up the Star Harvester, an act that ignited a war and earned him the name the Fallen. To stop the destruction of both the planet and its sun, the remaining six stole and hid the Matrix of Leadership, sacrificing themselves to make a tomb of their own bodies, sealing the Matrix away. When Sam dies, his spirit communes with the six Primes and they tell him he has earned his destiny. They resurrect Sam, who uses the Matrix of Leadership to bring Optimus back to life and kill the Fallen.\n- Lockdown (voiced by Mark Ryan in the film,[7] Gregg Berger in Rise of the Dark Spark) - A Cybertronian assassin and bounty hunter who transforms into a grey 2013 Lamborghini Aventador LP 700-4 Coupe,[10] and the secondary antagonist of the Transformers: Age of Extinction movie. In Age of Extinction, Lockdown works for Quintessa to bring Optimus to a damaged Cybertron and kill any Autobots who refuse to give up his location. He also makes a deal with Attinger to kill both the remaining Autobots and Deceptions on Earth, while offering the Seed in exchange for aid in hunting Optimus. In a duel in Hong Kong, while trying to recapture Prime, Lockdown is bisected by Optimus from behind.\n- The Shadow Raiders - Lockdown's techno-organic henchmen. They use their Drone balls to detect intruders on ships. Most are killed by Cade, Shane, and Crosshairs, while the rest remain inside Lockdown's ship.\n- Steeljaws - Lockdown's techno-organic wolf-like hounds. During the Autobots' raid in the Knight Ship, while hanging on the cables, they are killed by Cade and Bumblebee.\n- Unicron (voiced by Colman Domingo) - A planet-sized Chaos Bringer, a very first Cybertronian and Cybertron's ancient enemy who formed around himself as the Earth. In The Last Knight, his six horns only appeared when emerging and sensing a damaged Cybertron's approach to collide with. Unicron appeared as the overarching antagonist of the Transformers: Rise of the Beasts film where he is depicted as a separate entity much like his G1 self-retconning his appearance in The Last Knight.\n- The Creators - The overarching antagonists of the Transformers: Age of Extinction movie, are unseen mysterious pink extraterrestrial race who are the creators of all Cybertronians. 65 million B.C.E., in their ships, they invade every organic planet, using the Seeds, cyberforming the planet, ending the age of Dinosaurs to an KT extinction event on Earth. They harvest and use the resultant metal and the AllSpark to build Cybertronians. Million years later, Quintessa sends Lockdown to Earth for one task - bring Optimus to rebuild a damaged Cybertron, kill any Autobots that interfere, and wanting the Creators' \"chessboard cleaned\". They appear to be hostile and consider the intermingling of species to upset the cosmic balance. After Lockdown is killed, Optimus flies into space, stating that he is coming for them with the Seed.\n- Quintessa (voiced and portrayed by Gemma Chan) - A forceful, malevolent Cybertronian sorceress and the \"Prime of Life\" who seeks to destroy Unicron (and the Earth), and the main antagonist of the Transformers: The Last Knight movie. She originally possesses a magical staff for Cybertron till her Knights betray her, steal, and hide the staff on Earth. After Cybertron was destroyed in Dark of the Moon, she plans to destroy the Earth to rebuild her planet by draining Unicron's energy with Megatron and a formerly-brainwashed Optimus, under her spell as \"Nemesis Prime\", to find her staff. Originally killed by Bumblebee from behind, she secretly survived when she used Space Bridges forcing her to retreat, disguises herself as a human, and shows the humans how to kill Unicron.\n- The Knights of Iacon - Twelve Cybertronian Guardian Knights[69] who betrayed Quintessa, took, hid her staff on Earth within their crashed ship, and later gave it to Merlin during the Dark Ages. They also combine into a giant three-headed dragon named Dragonstorm.\n- Infernocons - Quintessa's six demonic minions who replaced her Knights and which combine into Infernocus. In the climax, they are destroyed by Optimus in one shot.\nNotes\n[edit]References\n[edit]- ^ \"Optimus Prime Trailer in Transformers 3\". Nerdsociety. July 7, 2010.

          "content": "Interface (computing)\nIn computing, an interface is a shared boundary across which two or more separate components of a computer system exchange information. The exchange can be between software, computer hardware, peripheral devices, humans, and combinations of these.[1] Some computer hardware devices, such as a touchscreen, can both send and receive data through the interface, while others such as a mouse or microphone may only provide an interface to send data to a given system.[2]\nHardware interfaces\n[edit]Hardware interfaces exist in many components, such as the various buses, storage devices, other I/O devices, etc. A hardware interface is described by the mechanical, electrical, and logical signals at the interface and the protocol for sequencing them (sometimes called signaling).[3] A standard interface, such as SCSI, decouples the design and introduction of computing hardware, such as I/O devices, from the design and introduction of other components of a computing system, thereby allowing users and manufacturers great flexibility in the implementation of computing systems.[3] Hardware interfaces can be parallel with several electrical connections carrying parts of the data simultaneously or serial where data are sent one bit at a time.[4]\nSoftware interfaces\n[edit]A software interface may refer to a wide range of different types of interfaces at different \"levels\". For example, an operating system may interface with pieces of hardware. Applications or programs running on the operating system may need to interact via data streams, filters, and pipelines.[5] In object oriented programs, objects within an application may need to interact via methods.[6]\nIn practice\n[edit]A key principle of design is to prohibit access to all resources by default, allowing access only through well-defined entry points, i.e., interfaces.[7] Software interfaces provide access to computer resources (such as memory, CPU, storage, etc.) of the underlying computer system; direct access (i.e., not through well-designed interfaces) to such resources by software can have major ramifications—sometimes disastrous ones—for functionality and stability.[citation needed]\nInterfaces between software components can provide constants, data types, types of procedures, exception specifications, and method signatures. Sometimes, public variables are also defined as part of an interface.[8]\nThe interface of a software module A is deliberately defined separately from the implementation of that module. The latter contains the actual code of the procedures and methods described in the interface, as well as other \"private\" variables, procedures, etc. Another software module B, for example the client to A, that interacts with A is forced to do so only through the published interface. One practical advantage of this arrangement is that replacing the implementation of A with another implementation of the same interface should not cause B to fail—how A internally meets the requirements of the interface is not relevant to B, which is only concerned with the specifications of the interface. (See also Liskov substitution principle.)[citation needed]\nIn object-oriented languages\n[edit]In some object-oriented languages, especially those without full multiple inheritance, the term interface is used to define an abstract type that acts as an abstraction of a class. It contains no data, but defines behaviours as method signatures. A class having code and data for all the methods corresponding to that interface and declaring so is said to implement that interface.[9] Furthermore, even in single-inheritance-languages, one can implement multiple interfaces, and hence can be of different types at the same time.[10]\nAn interface is thus a type definition; anywhere an object can be exchanged (for example, in a function or method call) the type of the object to be exchanged can be defined in terms of one of its implemented interfaces or base-classes rather than specifying the specific class. This approach means that any class that implements that interface can be used.[citation needed] For example, a dummy implementation may be used to allow development to progress before the final implementation is available. In another case, a fake or mock implementation may be substituted during testing. Such stub implementations are replaced by real code later in the development process.\nUsually, a method defined in an interface contains no code and thus cannot itself be called; it must be implemented by non-abstract code to be run when it is invoked.[citation needed] An interface called \"Stack\n\" might define two methods: push()\nand pop()\n. It can be implemented in different ways, for example, FastStack\nand GenericStack\n—the first being fast, working with a data structure of fixed size, and the second using a data structure that can be resized, but at the cost of somewhat lower speed.\nThough interfaces can contain many methods, they may contain only one or even none at all. For example, the Java language defines the interface Readable\nthat has the single read()\nmethod; various implementations are used for different purposes, including BufferedReader\n, FileReader\n, InputStreamReader\n, PipedReader\n, and StringReader\n. Marker interfaces like Serializable\ncontain no methods at all and serve to provide run-time information to generic processing using Reflection.[11]\nProgramming to the interface\n[edit]The use of interfaces allows for a programming style called programming to the interface. The idea behind this approach is to base programming logic on the interfaces of the objects used, rather than on internal implementation details. Programming to the interface reduces dependency on implementation specifics and makes code more reusable.[12]\nPushing this idea to the extreme, inversion of control leaves the context to inject the code with the specific implementations of the interface that will be used to perform the work.\nUser interfaces\n[edit]A user interface is a point of interaction between a computer and humans; it includes any number of modalities of interaction (such as graphics, sound, position, movement, etc.) where data is transferred between the user and the computer system.\nSee also\n[edit]- Abstraction inversion\n- Application binary interface\n- Application programming interface\n- Business Interoperability Interface\n- Computer bus\n- Hard disk drive interface\n- Implementation (computer science)\n- Implementation inheritance\n- Interoperability\n- Inheritance semantics\n- Modular programming\n- Software componentry\n- Virtual inheritance\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ Hookway, B.

That means the implementation can vary, and that is a healthy dependency relationship. For example, for testing purposes you can replace a heavy database implementation with a lighter-weight mock implementation. Fortunately, with today's refactoring support you no longer have to come up with an interface up front. You can distill an interface from a concrete class once you have the full insights into a problem. The intended interface is just one 'extract interface' refactoring away. ...\n- ^ Patterson, D.A.; Hennessy, J.L. (7 August 2004).

The company sells modular carpet tiles, luxury vinyl tile, and Nora brand rubber flooring.[4]\nHistory\n[edit]Interface, Inc. and its subsidiaries sells modular carpet tiles, luxury vinyl tile and Nora brand rubber flooring.\nInterface was founded in 1973 by Ray Anderson, whose decade and a half in the carpet trade had led him to create one of the first U.S. manufacturers of carpet tiles, also known as modular carpet or carpet squares. Carpet tiles, which originated in Europe, became highly popular during the 1980s as an alternative to broadloom carpet, especially in office environments that at the time were switching to flexible, “open” plans that required easy access to wiring and infrastructure beneath floors. Interface grew to become the largest carpet-tile maker on the planet.[5]\nStarting in 1994, Interface focused on environmental sustainability, especially in reducing the use of petroleum.[6] At this time, the company announced a program called Mission Zero with a goal of eliminating any negative impact the company may have on the environment by 2020.[5] Since 1996, Interface chose to adopt an innovation-based green strategy.[7] In a short period, it managed to reduce its impact on the environment by one third.[6] Each year, the company releases its annual EcoMetrics, demonstrating the company’s environmental impact and progress.\nIn 2016, Interface announced its new mission, Climate Take Back, which aimed to reverse global warming.[5] In 2018, Interface announced that all of its products, including all carpet tile and luxury vinyl tile (LVT), are carbon neutral across the entire product lifecycle through its Carbon Neutral Floors program.[8] in 2019, 90% of Interface’s energy came from renewables.[9]\nInterface was recognized as Recyclers of the Year by the Carpet America Recovery Effort (CARE).[10] In 2006 and 2016, Interface was voted number one in Globescan's survey of environmentally sustainable businesses.[11] They are also the recipient of The Queen's Award for Enterprise: Sustainable Development (Environmental Achievement) (2008).\nHistorical\n[edit]- 1973: Ray Anderson creates Carpets International.\n- 1974: Carpets International introduces GlasBac, a patented structured backing system that has become the industry standard for high-performance modular backings.[12]\n- 1982: Carpets International becomes Interface Flooring Systems, Inc, and acquires Compact Carpet of Canada, renaming it Interface Flooring Systems Canada, Inc.[13]\n- 1994: Ray Anderson experiences \"spear in the chest” epiphany, leading Interface to establish Mission Zero.[14]\n- 1994: Ray Anderson reads Paul Hawken's book The Ecology of Commerce, inspiring his first environmental speech; develops framework to track and measure sustainability progress, classified as Mount Sustainability.\n- 1995: Interface establishes ReEntry Recycling Program, which reclaims carpet to ensure used flooring tiles do not end up in landfills.[14]\n- 1996: Interface partners with yarn suppliers to develop recycled nylon.[15]\n- 1998: The company introduces NexStep polyurethane cushion backing.\n- 2001: Interface establishes new backing system, GlasBacRE, now featuring up to 81% total recycled content.\n- 2003: Interface launches first residential product through FLOR.[16]\n- 2003: Interface becomes the first carpet company to receive Environmentally Preferable Product (EPP) certification for its products and the first company to introduce Climate Neutral product offering through its Cool Carpet program.\n- 2006: Interface unveils TacTiles, the first glue-free and sustainable flooring installation method.[17]\n- 2008: Interface is first to pilot Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs).[18]\n- 2010: Interface develops first product with 100% recycled nylon with yarn supplier Aquafil.\n- 2012: Interface announces Net-Works in partnership with the Zoological Society of London to collect discarded fishing nets for recycling into new yarn.[19]\n- 2015: Interface introduces Skinny Planks, 25 x 100 cm carpet planks that can be used to create similar patterns to those found on timber or vinyl flooring.[20]\n- 2016: Interface launches new mission, Climate Take Back, which aims to reverse global warming.[21]\n- 2017: Interface announces entry into the hard surface flooring category with a line of luxury vinyl tile (LVT).[22]\n- 2017: Interface announces Proof Positive, a first-of-its-kind, carbon negative carpet tile prototype.[23]\n- 2018: Interface develops first carbon negative carpet tile backing, CircuitBac Green, to further reduce flooring’s carbon footprint.[24]\n- 2018: Interface acquires Nora Systems.[25]\n- 2019: Interface declares its entire portfolio carbon neutral across the entire product lifecycle through its Carbon Neutral Floors program.[26]\n- 2019: Interface celebrates Mission Zero success and continues to activate on Climate Take Back; releases 25th Sustainability Report, highlighting lessons learned and key EcoMetrics.[27]\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ \"Interface appoints Laurel M.

          "content": "Model (person)\nA model is a person with a role either to display commercial products (notably fashion clothing in fashion shows) or to serve as an artist's model.\nModelling (\"modeling\" in American English) entails using one's body to represent someone else's body or someone's artistic imagination of a body. For example, a woman modelling for shoes uses her foot to model the potential customers' feet. Modelling thus is different from posing for portrait photography, portrait painting, and distinct from other types of public performance, such as acting or dancing. Personal opinions are normally not expressed, and a model's reputation and image are considered critical.\nTypes of modelling include: fine art, fashion, glamour, fitness, and body-part promotional modelling. Models are featured in various media formats, including books, magazines, films, newspapers, the Internet, and television. Fashion modelling is sometimes featured in reality TV shows (America's Next Top Model). Modelling often is a part-time activity.\nArtist's models\n[edit]Artist's models pose for any visual artist as part of the creative process. Artist's models are often paid professionals who provide a reference or inspiration for a work of art that includes the human figure. The most common types of art created using models are figure drawing, figure painting, sculpture and photography, but almost any medium may be used. Although commercial motives dominate over aesthetics in illustration, its artwork commonly employs models. Models are most frequently employed for art classes or by informal groups of experienced artists who gather to share the expense of a model.\nFashion modelling\n[edit]History of fashion modelling\n[edit]Early years\n[edit]In 14th-century Europe, fashion had been displayed in miniature form to (often royal) clients by fashion dolls, before the clothes were made in human size.[1]\nModelling as a profession was first established in 1853 by Charles Frederick Worth, the \"father of haute couture\", when he asked his wife, Marie Vernet Worth, to model the potential clients for the clothes he designed.[2][3] The term \"house model\" was coined to describe this type of work. Eventually, this became common practice for Parisian fashion houses. There were no standard physical measurement requirements for a model, and most designers would use women of varying sizes to demonstrate variety in their designs.\nThe modelling profession expanded to photo modelling with the development of fashion photography. Models remained fairly anonymous, and relatively poorly paid, until the late 1940s, when the world's first three supermodels, Barbara Goalen, Bettina Graziani and Lisa Fonssagrives began commanding very large sums. During the 1940s and 1950s, Graziani was the most photographed woman in France and the undisputed queen of couture, while Fonssagrives appeared on over 200 Vogue covers; her name recognition led to the importance of Vogue in shaping the careers of fashion models. One of the most popular models during the 1940s was Jinx Falkenburg, who was paid $25 per hour, a large sum at the time;[4] through the 1950s, Wilhelmina Cooper, Jean Patchett, Dovima, Dorian Leigh, Suzy Parker, Evelyn Tripp and Carmen Dell'Orefice also dominated fashion.[5] Dorothea Church was among the first black models in the industry to gain recognition in Paris. However, these models were unknown outside the fashion community. Wilhelmina Cooper's measurements were 38\"-24\"-36\" whereas Chanel Iman's measurements are 32\"-23\"-33\".[6] In 1946, Ford Models was established by Eileen and Gerard Ford in New York, making it one of the oldest model agencies in the world.\nThe 1960s and the beginning of the industry\n[edit]In the 1960s, the modelling world established modelling agencies. Throughout Europe, secretarial services acted as models' agents charging them weekly rates for their messages and bookings. For the most part, models were responsible for their own billing. In Germany, agents were not allowed to work for a percentage of a person's earnings, so they referred to themselves as secretaries. Except for a few models travelling to Paris or New York, travelling was relatively unheard of for a model. Most models only worked in one market due to different labour laws governing modelling in various countries. In the 1960s, Italy had many fashion houses and fashion magazines but desperately needed models. Italian agencies often coerced models to return to Italy without work visas by withholding their pay.[7] They would also pay their models in cash, which models would have to hide from customs agents. It was not uncommon for models staying in hotels such as La Louisiana in Paris or the Arena in Milan to have their hotel rooms raided by the police looking for their work visas. It was rumoured that competing agencies were behind the raids. This led many agencies to form worldwide chains; for example, the Marilyn Agency has branches in Paris and New York.[7]\nBy the late 1960s, London was considered the best market in Europe due to its more organised and innovative approach to modelling. It was during this period that models began to become household names. Models such as Jean Shrimpton, Tania Mallet, Celia Hammond, Twiggy, and Penelope Tree dominated the London fashion scene and were well paid, unlike their predecessors.[8] Twiggy became The Face of '66 at the age of 16.[9] At this time, model agencies were not as restrictive about the models they represented, although it was uncommon for them to sign shorter models. Twiggy, who stood at 5 feet 6 inches (168 cm) with a 32\" bust and had a boy's haircut, is credited with changing model ideals. At that time, she earned £80 (equivalent to £1,639.1 or US$2,037.32 in 2023)[10] an hour, while the average wage was £15 (equivalent to £307.33 or US$382 in 2023)[10] a week.\nIn 1967, seven of the top model agents in London formed the Association of London Model Agents. The formation of this association helped legitimise modelling and changed the fashion industry. Even with a more professional attitude towards modelling, models were still expected to have their hair and makeup done before they arrived at a shoot. Meanwhile, agencies took responsibility for a model's promotional materials and branding. That same year, former top fashion model Wilhelmina Cooper opened up her own fashion agency with her husband called Wilhelmina Models. By 1968, FM Agency and Models 1 were established and represented models in a similar way that agencies do today.[11][12] By the late 1960s, models were treated better and were making better wages. One of the innovators, Ford Models, was the first agency to advance models money they were owed and would often allow teen models, who did not live locally, to reside in their house, a precursor to model housing.\nThe 1970s and 1980s\n[edit]The innovations of the 1960s flowed into the 1970s fashion scene. As a result of model industry associations and standards,[13] model agencies became more business minded, and more thought went into a model's promotional materials. By this time, agencies were starting to pay for a model's publicity.[7] In the early 1970s, Scandinavia had many tall, leggy, blonde-haired, blue-eyed models and not enough clients. It was during this time that Ford Models pioneered scouting.[7] They would spend time working with agencies holding modeling contests. This was the precursor to the Ford Models Supermodel of the World competition, established in 1980. Ford also focused its attention on Brazil, which had a wide array of seemingly \"exotic\" models, which eventually led to the establishment of Ford Models Brazil. During this time, the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue debuted. The magazine set the trend by photographing \"bigger and healthier\" California models,[14] and printing their names by their photos, thus turning many of them into household names and establishing the issue as a hallmark of supermodel status.[14]\nThe 1970s marked numerous milestones in fashion. Beverly Johnson was the first black woman to appear on the cover of U.S. Vogue in 1974.[15] Models, including Iman, Grace Jones, Pat Cleveland, Alva Chinn, Donyale Luna, Minah Bird, Naomi Sims, and Toukie Smith were some of the top black fashion models who paved the way for black women in fashion.[16] In 1975, Margaux Hemingway landed a then-unprecedented million-dollar contract as the face of Fabergé's Babe perfume and the same year appeared on the cover of Time magazine, labeled one of the \"New Beauties\", giving further name recognition to fashion models.[17]\nMany of the world's most prominent modeling agencies were established in the 1970s and early 1980s. These agencies created the standard by which agencies now run. In 1974, Nevs Models was established in London with only a men's board, the first of its kind. Elite Models was founded in Paris in 1975, as well as Friday's Models in Japan.[18][19] The next year Cal-Carries was established in Singapore, the first of a chain of agencies in Asia. In 1977, Select Model Management and Why Not Models in Milan opened its doors. By the 1980s, agencies such as Premier Model Management, Storm Models, Mikas, Marilyn, and Metropolitan Models had been established.\nIn October 1981, Life cited Shelley Hack, Lauren Hutton and Iman for Revlon, Margaux Hemingway for Fabergé, Karen Graham for Estée Lauder, Cristina Ferrare for Max Factor, and Cheryl Tiegs for CoverGirl by proclaiming them the \"million dollar faces\" of the beauty industry. These models negotiated previously unheard-of lucrative and exclusive deals with giant cosmetics companies, were instantly recognizable, and their names became well known to the public.[20]\nBy the 1980s, most models could make modeling a full-time career. Patti Hansen, one of the top earning models in 1980, earned $200 an hour for print and $2,000 for television plus residuals; it was estimated that she earned about $300,000 a year in 1980 (equivalent to $931,463 in 2023).[21] It was common for models to travel abroad and work throughout Europe. As modeling became global, numerous agencies began to think globally. In 1980, Ford Models, the innovator of scouting, introduced the Ford Models Supermodel of the World contest.[22] That same year, John Casablancas opened Elite Models in New York. In 1981, cosmetics companies began contracting top models to lucrative endorsement deals. By 1983, Elite had developed its own contest, the Elite Model Look competition. In New York, during the 1980s there were so-called \"model wars\" in which the Ford and Elite agencies fought over models and campaigns. Models were jumping back and forth between agencies such Elite, Wilhelmina, and Ford.[23] In New York, the late 1980s trend was the boyish look in which models had short cropped hair and looked androgynous. In Europe, the trend was the exact opposite. During this time, many American models who were considered more feminine-looking moved abroad.[24] By the mid-1980s, big hair was made popular by some musical groups, and the boyish look was out. The hourglass figure, a fashionable trend from the late 1940s to the early 1960s, has made a comeback.\n1990s\n[edit]The high fashion models of the late 1980s dominated the early 1990s. In 1990, Linda Evangelista famously said to Vogue, \"we don't wake up for less than $10,000 a day\". Evangelista and her contemporaries, Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford, Christy Turlington, Tatjana Patitz, Stephanie Seymour, and Yasmeen Ghauri became arguably the most recognisable models in the world, earning the moniker of \"supermodel\", and were boosted to global recognition and new heights of wealth for the industry.[25] In 1991, Turlington signed a contract with Maybelline that paid her $800,000 for twelve days' work each year.\nBy the mid‑1990s, the new \"heroin chic\" trend became popular amongst New York and London editorial clients. Kate Moss became its poster child through her ads for Calvin Klein. With the popularity of lingerie retailer Victoria's Secret, and the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, there was a need for healthier-looking[citation needed] supermodels such as Tyra Banks and Heidi Klum to meet commercial modelling demand. The mid‑1990s also saw many Asian countries establishing modelling agencies.\nBy the late 1990s, the heroin chic era had run its course. Teen-inspired clothing infiltrated mainstream fashion, teen pop music was on the rise, and artists such as Britney Spears, Aaliyah and Christina Aguilera popularised pleather and bare midriffs. As fashion changed to a more youthful demographic, the models who rose to fame had to be sexier for the digital age. Following Gisele Bündchen's breakthrough, a wave of Brazilian models including Adriana Lima and Alessandra Ambrosio rose to fame on runways and became popular in commercial modelling throughout the 2000s. Some have tied this increase in Brazilian models to the trend of magazines featuring celebrities instead of models on their covers.[26]\n2000s and since\n[edit]In the late 2000s, the Brazilians fell out of favour on the runways. Editorial clients were favouring models with a china-doll or alien look to them, such as Gemma Ward and Lily Cole. During the 2000s, Ford Models and NEXT Model Management were engaged in a legal battle, with each agency alleging that the other was stealing its models.[27]\nHowever, the most significant controversy of the 2000s was the health of high-fashion models participating in fashion week. While the health of models had been a concern since the 1970s, there were several high-profile news stories surrounding the deaths of young fashion models due to eating disorders and drug abuse. The British Fashion Council subsequently asked designers to sign a contract stating they would not use models under the age of sixteen.[28] On March 3, 2012, Vogue banned models under the age of sixteen as well as models who appeared to have an eating disorder.[29] Similarly, other countries placed bans on unhealthy, and underage models, including Spain, Italy, Israel and France, which all enacted a minimum body mass index (BMI) requirement. The French law also requires digitally altered pictures of models to be identified as such.[30]\nIn 2013, New York toughened its child labour law protections for models under the age of eighteen by passing New York Senate Bill No. 5486, which gives underage models the same labour protections afforded to child actors. Key new protections included the following: underage models are not to work before 5:00 pm or after 10:00 pm on school nights, nor were they to work later than 12:30 am on non-school nights; the models may not return to work less than twelve hours after they leave; a pediatric nurse must be on-site; an adult chaperone must accompany models under sixteen; parents or guardians of underage models must create a trust fund account into which employers will transfer a minimum of 15% of the child model's gross earnings; and employers must set aside time and a dedicated space for educational instruction.[31]\nRunway modelling\n[edit]Catwalk or runway models, also called live models, display clothes from fashion designers, fashion media, and consumers. During runway shows, models have to constantly change clothes and makeup. Models walk, turn, and stand to demonstrate a garment's key features. Models also go to interviews (called \"go and sees\") to present their portfolios.[32] A runway model can also work in other areas, such as department store fashion shows, and the most successful models sometimes create their own product lines or go into acting.[33]: 191–192\nTop runway models travel around the world to attend fashion shows. The most prestigious events are held in New York City, London, Paris, and Milan. Second-tier international fashion centre cities include Rome, Florence, Venice, Brescia, Barcelona, Los Angeles, Tokyo, and Moscow.\nThe criteria for runway models include certain height and weight requirements. The British Association of Model Agents (AMA) says that female models should be around 34\"-24\"-34\" and between 5 ft 8 in (173 cm) and 5 ft 11 in (180 cm) tall.[34] The average model is very slender. Those not meeting the size requirement may try to become a plus-size model.[35] According to the New York Better Business Career Services website, the preferred dimensions for a male model are a height of 5 ft 11 in (180 cm) to 6 ft 2 in (188 cm), a waist of 26–32 in (66–81 cm) and a chest measurement of 39–40 in (99–102 cm).[36] Male runway models are notably skinny and well toned.[37]\nMale and female models must also possess clear skin, healthy hair, and attractive facial features. Stringent weight and body proportion guidelines form the selection criteria by which established, and would‑be, models are judged for their placement suitability, on an ongoing basis. There can be some variation regionally, and by market tier, subject to current prevailing trends at any point, in any era, by agents, agencies and end-clients.\nFormerly, the required measurements for models were 35\"-23.5\"-35\" in (90-60-90 cm), the alleged measurements of Marilyn Monroe.[citation needed] Today's fashion models tend to have measurements closer to the AMA-recommended shape, but some – such as Afghan model Zohre Esmaeli – still have 35\"-23.5\"-35\" measurements. Although in some fashion centres, a size 00 is more desirable than a size 0.\nThe often thin shape of many fashion models has been criticised for warping girls' body image and encouraging eating disorders.[38] Organisers of a fashion show in Madrid in September 2006 turned away models who were judged to be underweight by medical personnel who were on hand.[39] In February 2007 a Uruguayan model, Luisel Ramos, died from heart problems secondary to malnutrition. Her sister Eliana Ramos also was a model and had died immediately after a runway show several months prior. They were amongst the three fashion models to die of malnutrition in a six-month span. The other victim was Ana Carolina Reston.[40] Luisel Ramos died of heart failure caused by anorexia nervosa just after stepping off the catwalk. In 2015, France passed a law requiring models to be declared healthy by a doctor to participate in fashion shows. The law also requires re-touched images to be marked as such in magazines.[41]\nMagazine modelling\n[edit]Fashion modelling also includes modelling clothing in fashion magazines. In Japan, there are different types of fashion magazine models. Exclusive models (専属モデル, senzoku moderu) are models who regularly appear in a fashion magazine and model exclusively for it.[42] On the other hand, street models, or \"reader models\" (読者モデル, dokusha moderu, abbreviated as \"dokumo\" for short), are amateur models who model part-time for fashion magazines in conjunction to school work and their main jobs.[42][43][44] Unlike professional models, street models are meant to represent the average person in appearance and do not appear on runways.[43] Street models are not exclusively contracted to fashion magazines.[42] If a street model is popular enough, some become exclusive models.[42] Many fashion icons and musicians in Japan began their careers as street models, including Kaela Kimura and Kyary Pamyu Pamyu.[43]\nPlus-size\n[edit]Plus-size models are models who generally have larger measurements than editorial fashion models, and are not necessarily overweight. The primary use of plus-size models is to appear in advertising and runway shows for plus-size labels. Plus-size models are also engaged in work not strictly related to selling large-sized clothing, e.g., stock photography and advertising photography for cosmetics, household and pharmaceutical products and sunglasses, footwear and watches. Therefore, plus-size models do not exclusively wear garments marketed as plus-size clothing. This is especially true when participating in fashion editorials for mainstream fashion magazines. Some plus-size models have appeared in runway shows and campaigns for mainstream retailers and designers such as Gucci, Guess, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Levi's and Versace Jeans.[45][46][47][48]\nNormal-size\n[edit]Also known as the \"in-between\" and \"middle models\",[49] they are neither considered catalogue size (0–2) nor plus-size (10 up).[50] There is criticism that these models have been left out of the conversation because fashion companies and brands opt to employ the extremes of the spectrum.[51][52]\nModel Camille Kostek who was on a solo cover of Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue in 2019 has stated that she was told by a well-known international modelling agency \"...that it was too bad that I wasn't a size 10. That plus size is a big market right now and it's too bad I wasn't measuring bigger. My size (4/6) is considered an \"in-between size\", meaning I'm not a straight model nor plus model, I'm right in the middle.[53][54] Actress Mindy Kaling has described this body type in her 2011 book Is Everybody Hanging Out Without Me? writing, \"Since I am not model-skinny, but also not super-fat... I fall into that nebulous, 'Normal American Woman Size' that legions of fashion stylists detest... Many stylists hate that size because, I think, to them, I lack the self-discipline to be an aesthetic, or the sassy confidence to be a total fatty hedonist. They're like, 'Pick a lane.'\"[55]\nBlack models\n[edit]The arrival of black women modelling as a profession began in early postwar America. It started most notably from the need of advertisers and a rise of black photography magazines. The women who advanced in such careers were those in a middle-class system emphasising the conservative value of marriage, motherhood, and domesticity. Originally titled the \"Brownskin\" model, black women refined the social, sexual, and racial realities confined in the gender expectations of the modelling world. There was a profound need for black women to partake in the advertising process for the new \"Negro Market\".[56] With the help of Branford Models, the first black agency, 1946 was the beginning of the black modelling era. Branford Models' was able to \"overturn the barriers facing African Americans in the early postwar period,\" especially by lifting at least one economic freedom.[56] In this postwar America, the demand for such presence in magazines advanced \"as a stage for models to display consumer goods\" while assisting \"in constructing a new visual discourse of urban middle-class African America\".[56] In March 1966, Donyale Luna became the first Black model to appear on the cover of the British edition of Vogue.[57][58]\nWhile they represented diversity, a major gap in the fashion industry, it was only until the 1970s that black models had a substantial presence in the modelling world. Known as the \"Black is Beautiful\" movement, the 1970s became the era of the black model. With growing disenfranchisement and racial inequality, the United States recognised the urgency of opening the \"doors of social access and visibility to black Americans\".[59] The world of fashion was the gateway for social change. \"The world of fashion was similarly looked to as a place where the culture could find signs of racial progress. Expressions of beauty and glamour mattered. Good race relations required taking note of who was selling women lipsticks and mini skirts, which meant that advertisers began looking for black models\"[59] Black models were looked to as the vehicle of social change. They were given the opportunity to balance out the lack of presence of black individuals in the mainstream culture. Agencies were beginning to scout black models and focus on the social change they were contributing to. Life magazine in October 1969, covered their issue with Naomi Sims, one of the most influential black models in the industry. Her rise to fame led to her being hired by international magazines and working on individual projects with designers across the globe.[60] In the Life Magazine issue, Black Beauty, a new agency that represented black models, had a spread in the magazine that showcased 39 black models. Each one of the models had unique features, allowing black expression to progress through this historic magazine spread.[59]\nWith the movement's presence both in magazines and on the runway, designers began to realise the need to include black models on their runways and advertisements. The Battle of Versailles was one of the most notable moments in fashion history that put black models on the map. Eleanor Lambert, creator of Fashion Week and a major \"[controller] of the narrative of American fashion\", set up a dinner and a fundraiser to both increase American fashion visibility and restore the palace of Versailles.[59] Five French designers and five American designers battled it out on the runway, showing off the fashion, and for the Americans, black models as well. Oscar de la Renta stated \"it was the black models that had made the difference.\" Pat Cleveland, Bethann Hardison, Billie Blair, Jennifer Brice, Alva Chinn, and Ramona Saunders, were among the many black models that helped Team America win and stun the French competition. This competition made the black model a worldwide phenomenon. The French were beginning to welcome diversity on the runway and in their advertising. With the recognition Versailles had given, black presence in the modelling world carried out into the 1980s and the 1990s. The models were now known by name and the publicity that came with the designers they were modelling for. With the rise of the supermodel, models like Naomi Campbell and Tyra Banks paved the way for black success.[59] Naomi Campbell, born in London, was the first black model to cover American Vogue, TIME magazine, Russian Vogue, and the first British black model to cover British vogue. Brands like Chanel, Louis Vitton, Balmain, Prada, and more have all featured Campbell in their campaigns. She used her remarkable success to achieve more than fashion excellence.\nBy the mid-1990s, black presence in the modelling world had dramatically decreased. Designers began to favour a consistent aesthetic and elected for skinnier white models. This reality was paved by models such as Kate Moss and Stella Tennant, who provided a more consistent look for the runway. At this time, \"the number of working black models in high-profile runway presentation... became so dire that stories began appearing in the mainstream media about the whitewashing of the runway\".[61] In response, models like Campbell, Iman, and Bethann Hardison, joined forces throughout the\"Diversity Coalition\" in an attempt to \"call out and accuse prominent fashion houses for snubbing Black and Asian models on the catwalk, editorial spreads, and campaigns\".[59] The lack of representation was, in part, due to the belief that \"black girls don't push products\", which \"encouraged people who work directly and indirectly in the industry to speak out on the injustices that go on within it\".[59] In the 1990s, it was quite clear that the top designers simply preferred a new aesthetic that excluded models of colour, which resulted in only 6% of runway models to be women of colour.[59] Campbell's Diversity Coalition's primary mission was to \"expedite inclusion on the runway by deliberately calling out designers who have executed acts of racism on the runway\".[59] According to Campbell, it was their choice to not include black models on the runway and desire a uniformed runway that resulted in a racist act. Although such a dramatic effort to exclude black presence from the fashion world, models like Tyra Banks and Veronica Webb persisted. Banks not only dominated the runway as a teen, she took over countless pop culture platforms. Being the first black model to cover Sports Illustrated, Banks was one of the most prominent models in the early 2000s. Covering Sports Illustrated, Elle, Essence, Vogue, and walking for Chanel, Chrisitan Dior, and Claude Monanta, Banks was truly dominating the fashion world. In addition, she acted in Fresh Prince of Bel Air and created her own reality competition show called America's Next Top Model.[60] In conversation with Trebay of Los the New York Times, Banks stated that her first cover on Sports Illustrated \"changed [her] life overnight. You have to think back to remember what that did for an appreciation of black beauty to have a black girl, a girl next door type, on the cover of one of the most mass mainstream magazines of our lives. It was a societal statement, a political statement, and an economic one\".[62] Now, models like Joan Smalls, Winne Harlow, Slick Woods, Jasmine Sanders and more are continuing the fight for black presence in the modelling world and using their successors as inspiration.\nFitting models\n[edit]A fit model (sometimes fitting model) is a person who is used by a fashion designer or clothing manufacturer to check the fit, drape and visual appearance of a design on a representative human being, effectively acting as a live mannequin.[63]\nParts models\n[edit]Some models are employed for their body parts. For example, hand models may be used to promote products held in the hand and nail-related products. (e.g. rings, other jewelry or nail polish). They are frequently part of television commercials.[64] Many parts models have exceptionally attractive body parts, but there is also demand for unattractive or unusual looking body parts for particular campaigns.\nHands are the most in-demand body parts. Feet models are also in high demand, particularly those that fit sample-size shoes.[65] Models are also successful modelling other specific parts including abs, arms, back, bust or chest, legs, and lips.[66] Some petite models (females who are under 5 ft 6 in (1.68 m) and do not qualify as fashion models) have found success in women's body part modelling.\nParts model divisions can be found at agencies worldwide. Several agencies solely represent parts models, including Hired Hands in London, Body Parts Models in Los Angeles, Carmen Hand Model Management in New York and Parts Models in New York.[67][68][69] Parts Models is the largest parts agency, representing over 300 parts models.[64][67][70][71][72]\nPetite models\n[edit]Petite models are models that are under the typical height requirements that are expected of fashion models. Petite models typically work more often in commercial and print modelling (rather than runway modelling).\nThe height of models is typically 5 feet 9 inches (1.75 m) and above for women, and 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 m) and above for men.[citation needed] Models who are shorter than these heights usually fall under the category of petite or commercial models.[citation needed]\nPodium models\n[edit]Podium models differ from runway models in that they do not walk down a runway, but rather just stand on an elevated platform. They resemble live mannequins placed in various places throughout an event. Attendees can walk up to the models and inspect and even feel the clothing. Podium Modelling is a practical alternative way of presenting a fashion show when space is too limited to have a full runway fashion show.\nEarnings and demographics\n[edit]According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics the median earnings for a model in the United States, as of 2021, is $34,000 annually. There are approximately 3,200 men and women who work as models full-time in the United States.[73]\nGlamour models\n[edit]Glamour modelling focuses on sexuality; thus, general requirements are often unclear, depending more on each case. Glamour models can be any size or shape. A study from 2014 that analysed glamour model profiles estimated that the mean values of female models were 1.68 metres (5 ft 6 in) height, 54 kilograms (119 lb) weight and 0.73 waist-to-hip ratio.[74]\nThere is no industry standard for glamour modelling and it varies greatly by country. For the most part, glamour models are limited to modelling in calendars, men's magazines, such as Playboy, bikini modelling, lingerie modelling, fetish modelling, music videos, and extra work in films. However, some extremely popular glamour models transition into commercial print modelling, appearing in swimwear, bikini and lingerie campaigns.\nIn the UK, glamour modelling became a prominent feature of the newspaper industry when The Sun established Page 3 in 1969,[75] a section in their newspaper which featured sexually suggestive images of Penthouse and Playboy models. From 1970 models appeared topless. In the 1980s, The Sun's competitors followed suit and produced their own Page 3 sections.[75] It was during this time that glamour models first came to prominence with the likes of Samantha Fox. As a result, the United Kingdom has a very large glamour market and numerous glamour modelling agencies.\nIt was not until the 1990s that modern glamour modelling was established. During this time, the fashion industry was promoting models with waif bodies and androgynous-looking women, which left a void. Several fashion models, who were deemed too commercial, and too curvaceous, were frustrated with industry standards, and took a different approach. Models such as Victoria Silvstedt left the fashion world and began modelling for men's magazines.[76] In the previous decades, posing nude for Playboy resulted in models losing their agencies and endorsements.[77] Playboy was a stepping stone which catapulted the careers of Victoria Silvstedt, Pamela Anderson, Jenny McCarthy, and Anna Nicole Smith. Pamela Anderson became so popular from her Playboy spreads that she was able to land roles on Home Improvement and Baywatch.\nIn the mid-1990s, a series of men's magazines were established such as Maxim, FHM, and Stuff. At the same time, magazines including Sweden's Slitz (formerly a music magazine) re-branded themselves as men's magazines. Pre-internet, these magazines were popular among men in their late teens and early twenties because they were considered more tasteful than their predecessors. With the glamour market growing, fashion moved away from the waifs and onto Brazilian bombshells. The glamour market, consisting mostly of commercial fashion and print models, became its own genre due to its popularity. Even in a large market like the United Kingdom, however, glamour models are not usually signed exclusively to one agency as they can not rely financially on one agency to provide them with enough work. It was, and still is, a common practice for glamour models to partake in kiss-and-tell interviews about their dalliances with famous men.[citation needed] The notoriety of their alleged bed-hopping often propels their popularity and they are often promoted by their current or former fling.[78] With Page 3 models becoming fixtures in the British tabloids, glamour models such as Jordan, now known as Katie Price, became household names. By 2004, Page 3 regulars earned anywhere from £30,000 to 40,000,[75] where the average salary of a non-Page 3 model, as of 2011, was between £10,000 and 20,000.[79] In the early 2000s, glamour models, and aspiring glamour models, appeared on reality television shows such as Big Brother to gain fame.[80] Several Big Brother alumni parlayed their fifteen minutes of fame into successful glamour modelling careers. However, partly because of competition from the upcoming internet -giving audiences access to large amounts of, often free, online content- and its own glamour stars, such as Jordan Capri, the offline glamour market became saturated by the mid-2000s, and numerous men's magazines including Arena, Stuff and FHM in the United States went under.[81] During this time, there was a growing trend of glamour models, including Kellie Acreman and Lauren Pope, becoming DJs to supplement their income. In a 2012 interview, Keeley Hazell said that going topless is not the best way to achieve success and that \"[she] was lucky to be in that 1% of people that get that, and become really successful.\"[82]\nGravure idols\n[edit]In Japan, a gravure idol (グラビアアイドル, gurabia aidoru), often abbreviated to gradol (グラドル, guradoru), is a female model who primarily models for magazines, especially men's magazines, photobooks or DVDs. It is considered part of the overall idol industry in Japan. \"Gurabia\" (グラビア) is a wasei-eigo term derived from \"rotogravure\", which is a type of intaglio printing process that was once a staple of newspaper photo features. The rotogravure process is still used for commercial printing of magazines, postcards, and cardboard product packaging.[83]\nGravure idols appear in a wide range of photographic styles and genres. Their photos are largely aimed at male audiences with poses or activities intended to be provocative or suggestive, generally accentuated by an air of playfulness and innocence rather than aggressive sexuality. Although gravure idols may sometimes wear clothing that exposes most of their body, they seldom appear fully nude. Gravure idols may be as young as pre-teen age up to their early thirties. In addition to appearing in mainstream magazines, gravure idols often release their own professional photobooks and DVDs for their fans. Many popular female idols in Japan started their careers as gravure idols.[83][84]\nAlternative models\n[edit]An alternative model is any model who does not fit into the conventional model types and may include punk, goth, fetish,[85] and tattooed[86] models or models with distinctive attributes. This type of modelling is usually a cross between glamour modelling and art modelling. Publishers such as Goliath Books in Germany introduced alternative models and punk photography to larger audiences. Billi Gordon, then known as Wilbert Anthony Gordon, was[when?] the top greeting card model in the world and inspired a cottage industry, including greeting cards, T-shirts, fans, stationery, gift bags, etc.[87]\nFitness models\n[edit]Fitness modelling focuses on displaying a healthy, toned physique. Fitness models usually have defined muscle groups. The model's body weight is greater due to muscle being denser than fat; however, they have a lower body fat percentage and a higher degree of muscle definition.\nFitness models are often used in magazine advertising; they can also in some cases be certified personal fitness trainers. However, other fitness models are also athletes and compete as professionals in fitness and figure competitions.\nThere are several agencies in large markets such as New York, London, and Germany that have fitness modelling agencies. While there is a large market for these models, most of these agencies are secondary agencies promoting models who typically earn their primary income as commercial models. There are also magazines that are geared towards specifically fitness modelling or getting fit and in shape.\nCommercial models\n[edit]Promotional models\n[edit]A promotional model is a model hired to drive consumer demand for a product, service, brand, or concept by interacting in person with potential consumers. The vast majority of promotional models tend to be attractive in physical appearance. They serve to provide information about the product or service and make it appealing to consumers. While the interaction length may be short, the promotional model delivers a live experience that reflects on the product or service he or she represents. This form of marketing touches fewer consumers for the cost than traditional advertising media (such as print, radio, and television); however, the consumer's perception of a brand, product, service, or company is often more profoundly affected by a live person-to-person experience.\nMarketing campaigns that make use of promotional models may take place in stores or shopping malls, at tradeshows, special promotional events, clubs, or even at outdoor public spaces. Promotional models may also be used as TV hosts/anchors for interviewing celebrities at film awards, sports events, etc. They are often held at high-traffic locations to reach as many consumers as possible or at venues where a particular type of target consumer is expected to be present.\nSpokesmodels\n[edit]\"Spokesmodel\" is a term used for a model who is employed to be associated with a specific brand in advertisements. A spokesmodel may be a celebrity used only in advertisements (in contrast to a brand ambassador who is also expected to represent the company at various events), but more often the term refers to a model who is not a celebrity in their own right. A classic example of the spokesmodel is the models hired to be the Marlboro Man between 1954 and 1999.\nTrade show models\n[edit]Trade show models work a trade show floorspace or booth and represent a company to attendees. Trade show models are typically not regular employees of the company, but are freelancers hired by the company renting the booth space. They are hired for several reasons: trade show models can make a company's booth more visible from the hundreds of other booths competing for attendee attention. They are articulate and quickly learn and explain or disseminate information on the company and its product(s) and service(s). And they can assist a company in handling a large number of attendees, which the company might otherwise not have enough employees to accommodate, possibly increasing the number of sales or leads resulting from participation in the show.\nAtmosphere models\n[edit]Atmosphere models are hired by the producers of themed events to enhance the atmosphere or ambience of their event. They are usually dressed in costumes exemplifying the event's theme and are often placed strategically in various locations around the venue. It is common for event guests to have their picture taken with atmosphere models. For example, if someone is throwing a \"Brazilian Day\" celebration, they would hire models dressed in samba costumes and headdresses to stand or walk around the party.[citation needed]\nInstagram models\n[edit]Instagram models are people who have accumulated a large number of followers on Instagram by posting engaging photos of themselves and their lifestyles, and are consequently hired by a company to advertise products as their influence and popularity can increase sales.[88] They should not be confused with established models such as Cara Delevingne and Gigi Hadid, who use Instagram to promote their traditional modelling careers,[89] although some models, such as Playboy model Lindsey Pelas, begin their careers conventionally and subsequently become Instagram models. Some models use Instagram success to develop their careers, such as Rosie Roff, who worked as a fashion model before being discovered via Instagram and gaining work as a ring girl in American boxing. In some cases, Instagram gives unsigned models a platform to attract the attention of agencies and talent scouts.[90] American model Matthew Noszka entered the profession as a result of being discovered on Instagram by Wilhelmina Models.[89]\nThe Instagram model concept originated in the late 2000s, when the boyfriends of fashion bloggers such as Rumi Neely and Chiara Ferragni began photographing their girlfriends in various outfits.[91] Instagram models often attempt to become social media influencers and engage in influencer marketing,[90] promoting products such as fashion brands and detox teas.[91] High-profile influencers can earn thousands of dollars for promoting commercial brands. When choosing whom to employ, brands have become less concerned with the number of followers an influencer has and more focused on their engagement marketing strategy. Research indicates that 89% of influencers use Instagram to promote themselves, compared to 20% using Twitter and 16% using Facebook.[90]\nSome Instagram models have gained high-profile modelling jobs and become celebrities.[92] Fitness model Jen Selter had become an Internet celebrity by 2014 and modelled for Vanity Fair magazine.[93] Cosplayer and model Anna Faith acquired over 250,000 Instagram followers by 2014, gaining success from her ability to impersonate the Disney character Elsa.[94][95] With Facebook's continuing decrease in post reach, Instagram has increasingly become cosplayers' favourite platform.[96][97] American actress Caitlin O'Connor had almost 300,000 Instagram followers in 2016, earning most of her social media income from endorsing products on Instagram.[98] Australian personal trainer Kayla Itsines acquired 5.5 million Instagram followers, allowing her to build a business in the fitness industry.[99] Brazilian model Claudia Alende gained a following of 2.8 million people on Instagram by 2015 and developed a career as a lingerie model.[100] Plus-size models Iskra Lawrence and Tess Holliday have used Instagram to demonstrate their potential as models.[90] Yashika Aannand, an Indian teenage actress, rose to prominence in the Tamil film industry after gaining popularity as an Instagram model with over 145,000 followers on her account by 2017.[101] Iraqi cross-dressing model, Noor Alsaffar, was killed in September 2023 as part of an increase in violence against LGBTQ+ people.[102]\nInstagram model techniques and aesthetics have also been used in unconventional or parody profiles. Instagram model Lil Miquela has blurred the line between reality and social media, amassing more than 200,000 followers without revealing whether she is real or computer-generated.[103] Australian comedian Celeste Barber had acquired 1.8 million Instagram followers by 2017, parodying celebrity fashion photographs with real-life reenactments.[104] In 2016, French organisation Addict Aide ran a campaign to raise awareness for alcohol abuse among young people in which a model posed as Louise Delage, a fictitious 25-year-old Parisian whose Instagram photos nearly always featured alcohol. The account amassed 65,000 followers in a month, after which a reveal video posted to it had over 160,000 views.[105]\nSome reports[106] suggest that a number of Instagram models obtain extra income by covertly working as prostitutes. Websites accusing various models of this, often without reliable evidence, have increased in popularity recently, sometimes with the unintended effect of increasing their earnings.[107] But false accusations on these sites can harm legitimate models' reputations, and some women in the industry consider them a way for men to exert power over women.[108]\nSee also\n[edit]- Hip hop model\n- Instagram's impact on people\n- List of models in music videos\n- Modeling agency\n- List of modeling agencies\n- Ring girl\n- Time for print\n- Female body shape\n- Size zero\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ Tom Tierney:Great Fashion Designs of the Victorian Era Paper Dolls in Full Color\n- ^ \"modelworker.com\".

          "description": "This article will help to answer some of your questions on how to break into the industry and guide you towards becoming a successful model.",
          "content": "How to Get into Modeling\nGetting started in the modeling world can feel like a daunting task. You’ve probably got all sorts of questions, like “Do I have what it takes?” “How do I get an agent?” “What are the pros and cons of becoming a model?” If you’re looking for help when if comes to getting into modeling, this article will help to answer some of your questions on how to break into the industry and guide you towards becoming a successful model.\nDo I Have What it Takes?\nDo you have the look? Being a model isn’t just about being “good looking” or “pretty.” There are a lot of beautiful people in the world. If you’re serious about getting into modeling, it’s important to have “a look.” There should be something unique about the way you look or the way you’re built. It could be a beauty mark (a la Cindy Crawford,) the way your dimples look when you smile, something about the shape of your chin or your nose that adds dimension to your face, or another unique quality. Embrace this. It will be what sets you apart from other models in the industry.\nAs far as common characteristics that are important for anyone looking to get into modeling, height is probably the single most important physical attribute for most models, with 5’7’’ generally considered a minimum. Of course there are exceptions to this rule (take Kate Moss, for example), but this is a good place to start in order to determine if you are meant for the modeling industry. Runway models should be at least 5’8” as a female and 6’0” as a male. For editorial modeling, having the right look is more important than height or slender frame alone. For convention/promotional models, it’s more about having an engaging personality and the ability to act as a product spokesperson. Different types of modeling have certain requirements, but before you get into modeling you should understand what type of modeling work you will be pursuing. Will you be on the runway? Do you want to be in magazines or be a part of private events?\nIn recent years, for example, there has been a move towards more plus-sized models in the business, along with growth in other niche areas like tattooed models. Your look can help to determine what area of modeling you will fit best into, as there are numerous subdivisions under the larger modeling umbrella. Remember, getting into modeling doesn’t just mean being tall and thin with perfect posture. It means identifying and playing to your own strengths, looking for the type of work that’s right for you.\nWhat are the Different Types of Modeling?\nMany models brand-new to the industry express surprise at just how many different genres are available for them to find work.\nHere is a list of the most well-known genres:\n- Runway (cat-walk) modeling – High-end models typically shooting for editorials, high-end designers, runway and fashion campaigns. Fashion models have very particular age, height, and measurement standards. The typical age is 16-21. Models can be younger than this, but many agencies will require models to be at least 16. Likewise, models can be older but agencies and clients tend to like their models looking younger and more youthful. Height is typically between 5’9″-6″, bust is between 32″-36″, waist is between 22″-26″, and hips should be between 33″-35″. Of course most woman don’t meet these standards and that is why fashion models generally get paid the most and work the most. If you do not meet these requirements, don’t worry, most women don’t and that doesn’t mean agencies don’t make exceptions and you can’t walk the runway.\n- Print (catalog, editorial) modeling – Another lucrative modeling genre that is slightly less restrictive than fashion modeling. Height is generally between 5’8″ and 5’11” and typical measurements are as follows: Bust 32″-35″, hips 33″-35″, and waist 22″-26″. Catalog and fashion are the two most specific modeling genres. That is why they are the most profitable.\n- Lingerie/swimsuit modeling – Models also tend to have specific measurement requirements. Typical lingerie measurements are: height 5’7″-6′, bust 32″-35″ C cup,waist 22″-26″, and hips 33″-35″. A bikini model will be similar to a lingerie model but with a slightly larger bust size.\n- Other types of modeling include television commercial, live product/brand, live showroom, web, and niche modeling (tattoo’s, piercings, petite, plus-size, mature, body part, fitness/body building, without clothes et al). Measurements will always vary depending on type of modeling and industry you’re working in.\nAre there areas of modeling listed above that you aren’t familiar with? You’re probably not alone. So which genre is right for you? Well, models with a girl-next-door look are often a great fit for commercial and catalog modeling to sell beauty products, clothes, and accessories in magazines and advertisements. If fitness is your passion, a major growing area of modeling is fitness modeling for girls who are in great shape and can help promote athletic wear and fitness companies. Knowing what type of model you best embody will allow you to be more successful because you can focus on that area. There are a lot of opportunities in the entertainment industry.This will help you avoid frustration as you try to get started in modeling, and will allow agencies and casting directors to see you more clearly fitting into their roster or filling their needs for a certain job.\nIf you’re just now getting into modeling, you may want to know if there are training classes specifically for modeling. It is important to be cautious if you believe you’ve found a modeling class because it could be a scam. It is generally safer and more beneficial to take other types of classes, like a dance class to improve your movement quality and body awareness, an acting class to help you feel more comfortable speaking and taking on commercial jobs, or a fitness class to help keep your body in shape. It is also hugely beneficial to spend time with a professional photographer since they can give you real-world advice on exactly what other photographers and directors are looking for from their subjects.\nHow Do I Get Started?\nSo you’ve decided you want to give the model life a shot. The first step to a successful career is to find a qualified, experienced agent. As with the “modeling classes” mentioned above, some modeling agencies are actually scams. It is extremely important to make sure the agencies you are considering working with are legitimate. Do your research! Checking out the websites of agencies you are interested in will help you get a sense of what types of models they look for, the jobs that their clients have booked and their overall professionalism. Model management is very important, it’s best to do your research before signing up with companies.\nThere are often references or recommendations online that can help lead you in the right direction. One of the biggest red flags is if an agency asks for money from a new client upfront, whether this is for a photo/portfolio package or for any other reason. Reputable agencies will never have a cost. They make money if you book a job, and only if you book a job. If you see signs that they are trying to earn their money in any other way, run – don’t walk, run – away.\nBuilding a Portfolio\nOnce you have compiled a list of reputable agencies that represent the type of model that you would like to be, it’s time to send them your “book.” This will include your “stats” (your basic measurements, height and weight,) and a portfolio of pictures. The most essential photos for you to have are simple digitals. Try to get pictures of yourself with little or no makeup, a very basic outfit with minimal accessories, and shot using natural lighting. It is important for the agency to see both your face and body so make sure to include a wide angle shot that shows your body and a closer in shot of your face. Wear fitted clothes to allow the agency to see the basic shape of your body. If you are hoping to land swimsuit or lingerie gigs, you should include those photos as well. Play around with angles and poses to find your most flattering look to send to agencies. Plan on a similar approach when attending open modeling calls; your clothes should be well-fitted and hair and makeup should be minimal.\nIf you have prior modeling experience and have professional pictures from past jobs, those are great to include as well. However, if you are just getting started, it will probably be well worth the investment to spend the money on a professional photographer for the purpose of getting high-quality photos to submit to agencies. From there, if you can afford to invest in quality, up-to-date photos each year it will be a huge benefit for you.\nPros and Cons\nThere is more to modeling than just looking pretty in front of the camera. It is a business first and foremost, so it is critical that aspiring models treat it as such and approach it as they would any other job, with professionalism, grace and resilience. There are many great benefits to being a model. You get the chance to help bring others’ visions to life. It can truly be an amazing opportunity to do what you love, meet really great people – whether they are photographers, designers or fellow models – and explore cities all over the globe.\nHowever, the industry is certainly not all about the glitz and glamor as it may appear from an outsider’s perspective. Unless you are a supermodel doing major campaigns, you typically won’t make a lot of money (at least not consistently.) Modeling can be physically, mentally and emotionally taxing. There can be a lot of competition between models since there are often a number of models all vying for the same, small pool of jobs. This inevitably means a lot of rejection, which can be emotionally draining.\nIt is important to develop a thick skin to protect yourself from the rejection you will face. Try not to take the rejections personally. They will happen. Companies hiring models for shoots and casting for shows have specific needs, and you may not fit what they are looking for on that particular day. If you are able to embrace the realities of the business and stay persistent, it will not only benefit your career but also make you a stronger person.\nA Few Tips for Every Model\n- Be on time! Communication is key\n- Show commitment\n- Be persistent and stay positive\n- You will hear “no” more times than you’ll hear “yes”. Don’t let it affect your confidence. Don’t let it affect your life.\n- Take care of yourself, your body, your lifestyle.\n- Be careful of who you are working with and what you’re willing to do.\n- Have a plan B. There may not be enough work for you to make a living\n- Make sure you have a real relationship with your agent. Be willing to give and take. Help them out and they will help you out.\n- Always be expanding your talents. If you want to book new types of work, gain new skills.\nDon’t Give Up\nA person with a thick skin and strong sense of self-worth is in a good position mentally and emotionally to take on the modeling world. But what about financially? Jobs early on in your career may be sparse and not pay you enough to help cover your rent, especially if you live in a major market. These major cities may offer the most in the way of job opportunities, but they can also be extremely expensive to live in. As you get into modeling, you should plan on picking up another job in order to pay the bills. A job in hospitality, for example, can be a good option for a model since it will offer flexible hours and still allow you to earn decent money in limited time. Plan ahead for this.\nIt is important to be both patient and determined when pursuing a career in modeling. Opportunities may not come right away. It will take time to develop relationships with influential people in the industry.

          "content": "Model\nA model is an informative representation of an object, person, or system. The term originally denoted the plans of a building in late 16th-century English, and derived via French and Italian ultimately from Latin modulus, 'a measure'.[1]\nModels can be divided into physical models (e.g. a ship model or a fashion model) and abstract models (e.g. a set of mathematical equations describing the workings of the atmosphere for the purpose of weather forecasting). Abstract or conceptual models are central to philosophy of science.[2][3]\nIn scholarly research and applied science, a model should not be confused with a theory: while a model seeks only to represent reality with the purpose of better understanding or predicting the world, a theory is more ambitious in that it claims to be an explanation of reality.[4]\nTypes of model\n[edit]Model in specific contexts\n[edit]As a noun, model has specific meanings in certain fields, derived from its original meaning of \"structural design or layout\":\n- Model (art), a person posing for an artist, e.g. a 15th-century criminal representing the biblical Judas in Leonardo da Vinci's painting The Last Supper\n- Model (person), a person who serves as a template for others to copy, as in a role model, often in the context of advertising commercial products; e.g. the first fashion model, Marie Vernet Worth in 1853, wife of designer Charles Frederick Worth.[5][6]\n- Model (product), a particular design of a product as displayed in a catalogue or show room (e.g. Ford Model T, an early car model)\n- Model (organism) a non-human species that is studied to understand biological phenomena in other organisms, e.g. a guinea pig starved of vitamin C to study scurvy, an experiment that would be immoral to conduct on a person\n- Model (mimicry), a species that is mimicked by another species\n- Model (logic), a structure (a set of items, such as natural numbers 1, 2, 3,..., along with mathematical operations such as addition and multiplication, and relations, such as ) that satisfies a given system of axioms (basic truisms), i.e. that satisfies the statements of a given theory[7]\n- Model (CGI), a mathematical representation of any surface of an object in three dimensions via specialized software\n- Model (MVC), the information-representing internal component of a software, as distinct from its user interface\nPhysical model\n[edit]A physical model (most commonly referred to simply as a model but in this context distinguished from a conceptual model) is a smaller or larger physical representation of an object, person or system. The object being modelled may be small (e.g., an atom) or large (e.g., the Solar System) or life-size (e.g., a fashion model displaying clothes for similarly-built potential customers).\nThe geometry of the model and the object it represents are often similar in the sense that one is a rescaling of the other. However, in many cases the similarity is only approximate or even intentionally distorted. Sometimes the distortion is systematic, e.g., a fixed scale horizontally and a larger fixed scale vertically when modelling topography to enhance a region's mountains.\nAn architectural model permits visualization of internal relationships within the structure or external relationships of the structure to the environment. Another use is as a toy.\nInstrumented physical models are an effective way of investigating fluid flows for engineering design. Physical models are often coupled with computational fluid dynamics models to optimize the design of equipment and processes. This includes external flow such as around buildings, vehicles, people, or hydraulic structures. Wind tunnel and water tunnel testing is often used for these design efforts. Instrumented physical models can also examine internal flows, for the design of ductwork systems, pollution control equipment, food processing machines, and mixing vessels. Transparent flow models are used in this case to observe the detailed flow phenomenon. These models are scaled in terms of both geometry and important forces, for example, using Froude number or Reynolds number scaling (see Similitude). In the pre-computer era, the UK economy was modelled with the hydraulic model MONIAC, to predict for example the effect of tax rises on employment.\n-\nWater-powered model of the UK economy – MONIAC in the Science Museum, London\n-\nFemale model demonstrating brassiere for similarly-built potential buyers\n-\nModel of a war scene — Australian War Memorial, Canberra\n-\nGuinea pig used as animal model for studying human leptospirosis\n-\nNASA wind tunnel with the scale model of an aeroplane\nConceptual model\n[edit]A conceptual model is a theoretical representation of a system, e.g. a set of mathematical equations attempting to describe the workings of the atmosphere for the purpose of weather forecasting.[8] It consists of concepts used to help understand or simulate a subject the model represents.\nAbstract or conceptual models are central to philosophy of science,[2][3] as almost every scientific theory effectively embeds some kind of model of the physical or human sphere. In some sense, a physical model \"is always the reification of some conceptual model; the conceptual model is conceived ahead as the blueprint of the physical one\", which is then constructed as conceived.[9] Thus, the term refers to models that are formed after a conceptualization or generalization process.[2][3]\nExamples\n[edit]- Conceptual model (computer science), an agreed representation of entities and their relationships, to assist in developing software\n- Economic model, a theoretical construct representing economic processes\n- Language model a probabilistic model of a natural language, used for speech recognition, language generation, and information retrieval\n- Large language models are artificial neural networks used for generative artificial intelligence (AI), e.g. ChatGPT\n- Mathematical model, a description of a system using mathematical concepts and language\n- Statistical model, a mathematical model that usually specifies the relationship between one or more random variables and other non-random variables\n- Model (CGI), a mathematical representation of any surface of an object in three dimensions via specialized software\n- Medical model, a proposed \"set of procedures in which all doctors are trained\"\n- Mental model, in psychology, an internal representation of external reality\n- Model (logic), a set along with a collection of finitary operations, and relations that are defined on it, satisfying a given collection of axioms\n- Model (MVC), information-representing component of a software, distinct from the user interface (the \"view\"), both linked by the \"controller\" component, in the context of the model–view–controller software design\n- Model act, a law drafted centrally to be disseminated and proposed for enactment in multiple independent legislatures\n- Standard model (disambiguation)\nProperties of models, according to general model theory\n[edit]According to Herbert Stachowiak, a model is characterized by at least three properties:[10]\n- 1. Mapping\n- A model always is a model of something—it is an image or representation of some natural or artificial, existing or imagined original,[11] where this original itself could be a model.\n- 2. Reduction\n- In general, a model will not include all attributes that describe the original but only those that appear relevant to the model's creator or user.\n- 3. Pragmatism\n- A model does not relate unambiguously to its original. It is intended to work as a replacement for the original\n- a) for certain subjects (for whom?)\n- b) within a certain time range (when?)\n- c) restricted to certain conceptual or physical actions (what for?).\nFor example, a street map is a model of the actual streets in a city (mapping), showing the course of the streets while leaving out, say, traffic signs and road markings (reduction), made for pedestrians and vehicle drivers for the purpose of finding one's way in the city (pragmatism).\nAdditional properties have been proposed, like extension and distortion[12] as well as validity.[13] The American philosopher Michael Weisberg differentiates between concrete and mathematical models and proposes computer simulations (computational models) as their own class of models.[14]\nUses of models\n[edit]According to Bruce Edmonds, there are at least 5 general uses for models:[15]\n- Prediction: reliably anticipating unknown data, including data within the domain of the training data (interpolation), and outside the domain (extrapolation)\n- Explanation: establishing plausible chains of causality by proposing mechanisms that can explain patterns seen in data\n- Theoretical exposition: discovering or proposing new hypotheses, or refuting existing hypotheses about the behaviour of the system being modelled\n- Description: representing important aspects of the system being modelled\n- Illustration: communicating an idea or explanation\nSee also\n[edit]References\n[edit]- ^ Oxford English Dictionary, Oxford University Press, doi:10.1093/OED/3984201854, retrieved 1 July 2023\n- ^ a b c Merriam-Webster, Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, Merriam-Webster.\n- ^ a b c Tatomir, A.; et al.

          "content": "Modeling and simulation\nModeling and simulation (M&S) is the use of models (e.g., physical, mathematical, behavioral, or logical representation of a system, entity, phenomenon, or process) as a basis for simulations to develop data utilized for managerial or technical decision making.[1][2]\nIn the computer application of modeling and simulation a computer is used to build a mathematical model which contains key parameters of the physical model. The mathematical model represents the physical model in virtual form, and conditions are applied that set up the experiment of interest. The simulation starts – i.e., the computer calculates the results of those conditions on the mathematical model – and outputs results in a format that is either machine- or human-readable, depending upon the implementation.\nThe use of M&S within engineering is well recognized. Simulation technology belongs to the tool set of engineers of all application domains and has been included in the body of knowledge of engineering management. M&S helps to reduce costs, increase the quality of products and systems, and document and archive lessons learned. Because the results of a simulation are only as good as the underlying model(s), engineers, operators, and analysts must pay particular attention to its construction. To ensure that the results of the simulation are applicable to the real world, the user must understand the assumptions, conceptualizations, and constraints of its implementation. Additionally, models may be updated and improved using results of actual experiments. M&S is a discipline on its own. Its many application domains often lead to the assumption that M&S is a pure application. This is not the case and needs to be recognized by engineering management in the application of M&S.\nThe use of such mathematical models and simulations avoids actual experimentation, which can be costly and time-consuming. Instead, mathematical knowledge and computational power is used to solve real-world problems cheaply and in a time efficient manner. As such, M&S can facilitate understanding a system's behavior without actually testing the system in the real world. For example, to determine which type of spoiler would improve traction the most while designing a race car, a computer simulation of the car could be used to estimate the effect of different spoiler shapes on the coefficient of friction in a turn. Useful insights about different decisions in the design could be gleaned without actually building the car. In addition, simulation can support experimentation that occurs totally in software, or in human-in-the-loop environments where simulation represents systems or generates data needed to meet experiment objectives. Furthermore, simulation can be used to train persons using a virtual environment that would otherwise be difficult or expensive to produce.\nInterest in simulations\n[edit]Technically, simulation is well accepted. The 2006 National Science Foundation (NSF) Report on \"Simulation-based Engineering Science\"[3] showed the potential of using simulation technology and methods to revolutionize the engineering science. Among the reasons for the steadily increasing interest in simulation applications are the following:\n- Using simulations is generally cheaper, safer and sometimes more ethical than conducting real-world experiments. For example, supercomputers are sometimes used to simulate the detonation of nuclear devices and their effects in order to support better preparedness in the event of a nuclear explosion.[4] Similar efforts are conducted to simulate hurricanes and other natural catastrophes.[5][6][7]\n- Simulations can often be even more realistic than traditional experiments, as they allow the free configuration of the realistic range of environment parameters found in the operational application field of the final product. Examples are supporting deep water operation of the US Navy or the simulating the surface of neighbored planets in preparation of NASA missions.\n- Simulations can often be conducted faster than real time. This allows using them for efficient if-then-else analyses of different alternatives, in particular when the necessary data to initialize the simulation can easily be obtained from operational data. This use of simulation adds decision support simulation systems to the tool box of traditional decision support systems.\n- Simulations allow setting up a coherent synthetic environment that allows for integration of simulated systems in the early analysis phase via mixed virtual systems with first prototypical components to a virtual test environment for the final system. If managed correctly, the environment can be migrated from the development and test domain to the training and education domain in follow-on life cycle phases for the systems (including the option to train and optimize a virtual twin of the real system under realistic constraints even before first components are being built).\nThe military and defense domain, in particular within the United States, has been the main M&S champion, in form of funding as well as application of M&S. E.g., M&S in modern military organizations is part of the acquisition/procurement strategy. Specifically, M&S is used to conduct Events and Experiments that influence requirements and training for military systems. As such, M&S is considered an integral part of systems engineering of military systems. Other application domains, however, are currently catching up. M&S in the fields of medicine, transportation, and other industries is poised to rapidly outstrip DoD's use of M&S in the years ahead, if it hasn't already happened.[8]\nSimulation in science\n[edit]Modeling and simulation are important in research. Representing the real systems either via physical reproductions at smaller scale, or via mathematical models that allow representing the dynamics of the system via simulation, allows exploring system behavior in an articulated way which is often either not possible, or too risky in the real world.\nAs an emerging discipline\n[edit]\"The emerging discipline of M&S is based on developments in diverse computer science areas as well as influenced by developments in Systems Theory, Systems Engineering, Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, and more. This foundation is as diverse as that of engineering management and brings elements of art, engineering, and science together in a complex and unique way that requires domain experts to enable appropriate decisions when it comes to application or development of M&S technology in the context of this paper. The diversity and application-oriented nature of this new discipline sometimes result in the challenge, that the supported application domains themselves already have vocabularies in place that are not necessarily aligned between disjunctive domains. A comprehensive and concise representation of concepts, terms, and activities is needed that make up a professional Body of Knowledge for the M&S discipline. Due to the broad variety of contributors, this process is still ongoing.\"[9]\nPadilla et al. recommend in \"Do we Need M&S Science\" to distinguish between M&S Science, Engineering, and Applications.[10]\n- M&S Science contributes to the Theory of M&S, defining the academic foundations of the discipline.\n- M&S Engineering is rooted in Theory but looks for applicable solution patterns. The focus is general methods that can be applied in various problem domains.\n- M&S Applications solve real world problems by focusing on solutions using M&S. Often, the solution results from applying a method, but many solutions are very problem domain specific and are derived from problem domain expertise and not from any general M&S theory or method.\nModels can be composed of different units (models at finer granularity) linked to achieving a specific goal; for this reason they can be also called modeling solutions.\nMore generally, modeling and simulation is a key enabler for systems engineering activities as the system representation in a computer readable (and possibly executable) model enables engineers to reproduce the system (or Systems of System) behavior. A collection of applicative modeling and simulation method to support systems engineering activities in provided in.[11]\nApplication domains\n[edit]There are many categorizations possible, but the following taxonomy has been very successfully used in the defense domain, and is currently applied to medical simulation and transportation simulation as well.\n- Analyses Support is conducted in support of planning and experimentation. Very often, the search for an optimal solution that shall be implemented is driving these efforts. What-if analyses of alternatives fall into this category as well. This style of work is often accomplished by simulysts - those having skills in both simulation and as analysts. This blending of simulation and analyst is well noted in Kleijnen.[citation needed]\n- Systems Engineering Support is applied for the procurement, development, and testing of systems. This support can start in early phases and include topics like executable system architectures, and it can support testing by providing a virtual environment in which tests are conducted. This style of work is often accomplished by engineers and architects.\n- Training and Education Support provides simulators, virtual training environments, and serious games to train and educate people. This style of work is often accomplished by trainers working in concert with computer scientists.\nA special use of Analyses Support is applied to ongoing business operations. Traditionally, decision support systems provide this functionality. Simulation systems improve their functionality by adding the dynamic element and allow to compute estimates and predictions, including optimization and what-if analyses.\nIndividual concepts\n[edit]Although the terms \"modeling\" and \"simulation\" are often used as synonyms within disciplines applying M&S exclusively as a tool, within the discipline of M&S both are treated as individual and equally important concepts. Modeling is understood as the purposeful abstraction of reality, resulting in the formal specification of a conceptualization and underlying assumptions and constraints. M&S is in particular interested in models that are used to support the implementation of an executable version on a computer. The execution of a model over time is understood as the simulation. While modeling targets the conceptualization, simulation challenges mainly focus on implementation, in other words, modeling resides on the abstraction level, whereas simulation resides on the implementation level.\nConceptualization and implementation – modeling and simulation – are two activities that are mutually dependent, but can nonetheless be conducted by separate individuals. Management and engineering knowledge and guidelines are needed to ensure that they are well connected. Like an engineering management professional in systems engineering needs to make sure that the systems design captured in a systems architecture is aligned with the systems development, this task needs to be conducted with the same level of professionalism for the model that has to be implemented as well. As the role of big data and analytics continues to grow, the role of combined simulation of analysis is the realm of yet another professional called a simplest – in order to blend algorithmic and analytic techniques through visualizations available directly to decision makers. A study designed for the Bureau of Labor and Statistics[12] by Lee et al. provides an interesting look at how bootstrap techniques (statistical analysis) were used with simulation to generate population data where there existed none.\nAcademic programs\n[edit]Modeling and Simulation has only recently become an academic discipline of its own. Formerly, those working in the field usually had a background in engineering.\nThe following institutions offer degrees in Modeling and Simulation:\n- Ph D.

          "content": "Data modeling\nData modeling in software engineering is the process of creating a data model for an information system by applying certain formal techniques. It may be applied as part of broader Model-driven engineering (MDE) concept.\nOverview\n[edit]Data modeling is a process used to define and analyze data requirements needed to support the business processes within the scope of corresponding information systems in organizations. Therefore, the process of data modeling involves professional data modelers working closely with business stakeholders, as well as potential users of the information system.\nThere are three different types of data models produced while progressing from requirements to the actual database to be used for the information system.[2] The data requirements are initially recorded as a conceptual data model which is essentially a set of technology independent specifications about the data and is used to discuss initial requirements with the business stakeholders. The conceptual model is then translated into a logical data model, which documents structures of the data that can be implemented in databases. Implementation of one conceptual data model may require multiple logical data models. The last step in data modeling is transforming the logical data model to a physical data model that organizes the data into tables, and accounts for access, performance and storage details. Data modeling defines not just data elements, but also their structures and the relationships between them.[3]\nData modeling techniques and methodologies are used to model data in a standard, consistent, predictable manner in order to manage it as a resource. The use of data modeling standards is strongly recommended for all projects requiring a standard means of defining and analyzing data within an organization, e.g., using data modeling:\n- to assist business analysts, programmers, testers, manual writers, IT package selectors, engineers, managers, related organizations and clients to understand and use an agreed-upon semi-formal model that encompasses the concepts of the organization and how they relate to one another\n- to manage data as a resource\n- to integrate information systems\n- to design databases/data warehouses (aka data repositories)\nData modelling may be performed during various types of projects and in multiple phases of projects. Data models are progressive; there is no such thing as the final data model for a business or application. Instead, a data model should be considered a living document that will change in response to a changing business. The data models should ideally be stored in a repository so that they can be retrieved, expanded, and edited over time. Whitten et al. (2004) determined two types of data modelling:[4]\n- Strategic data modelling: This is part of the creation of an information systems strategy, which defines an overall vision and architecture for information systems. Information technology engineering is a methodology that embraces this approach.\n- Data modelling during systems analysis: In systems analysis logical data models are created as part of the development of new databases.\nData modelling is also used as a technique for detailing business requirements for specific databases. It is sometimes called database modelling because a data model is eventually implemented in a database.[4]\nTopics\n[edit]Data models\n[edit]Data models provide a framework for data to be used within information systems by providing specific definitions and formats. If a data model is used consistently across systems then compatibility of data can be achieved. If the same data structures are used to store and access data then different applications can share data seamlessly. The results of this are indicated in the diagram. However, systems and interfaces are often expensive to build, operate, and maintain. They may also constrain the business rather than support it. This may occur when the quality of the data models implemented in systems and interfaces is poor.[1]\nSome common problems found in data models are:\n- Business rules, specific to how things are done in a particular place, are often fixed in the structure of a data model. This means that small changes in the way business is conducted lead to large changes in computer systems and interfaces. So, business rules need to be implemented in a flexible way that does not result in complicated dependencies, rather the data model should be flexible enough so that changes in the business can be implemented within the data model in a relatively quick and efficient way.\n- Entity types are often not identified, or are identified incorrectly. This can lead to replication of data, data structure and functionality, together with the attendant costs of that duplication in development and maintenance. Therefore, data definitions should be made as explicit and easy to understand as possible to minimize misinterpretation and duplication.\n- Data models for different systems are arbitrarily different. The result of this is that complex interfaces are required between systems that share data. These interfaces can account for between 25 and 70% of the cost of current systems. Required interfaces should be considered inherently while designing a data model, as a data model on its own would not be usable without interfaces within different systems.\n- Data cannot be shared electronically with customers and suppliers, because the structure and meaning of data have not been standardised. To obtain optimal value from an implemented data model, it is very important to define standards that will ensure that data models will both meet business needs and be consistent.[1]\nConceptual, logical and physical schemas\n[edit]In 1975 ANSI described three kinds of data-model instance:[5]\n- Conceptual schema: describes the semantics of a domain (the scope of the model). For example, it may be a model of the interest area of an organization or of an industry. This consists of entity classes, representing kinds of things of significance in the domain, and relationship assertions about associations between pairs of entity classes. A conceptual schema specifies the kinds of facts or propositions that can be expressed using the model. In that sense, it defines the allowed expressions in an artificial \"language\" with a scope that is limited by the scope of the model. Simply described, a conceptual schema is the first step in organizing the data requirements.\n- Logical schema: describes the structure of some domain of information. This consists of descriptions of (for example) tables, columns, object-oriented classes, and XML tags. The logical schema and conceptual schema are sometimes implemented as one and the same.[2]\n- Physical schema: describes the physical means used to store data. This is concerned with partitions, CPUs, tablespaces, and the like.\nAccording to ANSI, this approach allows the three perspectives to be relatively independent of each other. Storage technology can change without affecting either the logical or the conceptual schema. The table/column structure can change without (necessarily) affecting the conceptual schema. In each case, of course, the structures must remain consistent across all schemas of the same data model.\nData modelling process\n[edit]In the context of business process integration (see figure), data modeling complements business process modeling, and ultimately results in database generation.[6]\nThe process of designing a database involves producing the previously described three types of schemas – conceptual, logical, and physical. The database design documented in these schemas is converted through a Data Definition Language, which can then be used to generate a database. A fully attributed data model contains detailed attributes (descriptions) for every entity within it. The term \"database design\" can describe many different parts of the design of an overall database system. Principally, and most correctly, it can be thought of as the logical design of the base data structures used to store the data. In the relational model these are the tables and views. In an object database the entities and relationships map directly to object classes and named relationships. However, the term \"database design\" could also be used to apply to the overall process of designing, not just the base data structures, but also the forms and queries used as part of the overall database application within the Database Management System or DBMS.\nIn the process, system interfaces account for 25% to 70% of the development and support costs of current systems. The primary reason for this cost is that these systems do not share a common data model. If data models are developed on a system by system basis, then not only is the same analysis repeated in overlapping areas, but further analysis must be performed to create the interfaces between them. Most systems within an organization contain the same basic data, redeveloped for a specific purpose. Therefore, an efficiently designed basic data model can minimize rework with minimal modifications for the purposes of different systems within the organization[1]\nModeling methodologies\n[edit]Data models represent information areas of interest. While there are many ways to create data models, according to Len Silverston (1997)[7] only two modeling methodologies stand out, top-down and bottom-up:\n- Bottom-up models or View Integration models are often the result of a reengineering effort. They usually start with existing data structures forms, fields on application screens, or reports. These models are usually physical, application-specific, and incomplete from an enterprise perspective. They may not promote data sharing, especially if they are built without reference to other parts of the organization.[7]\n- Top-down logical data models, on the other hand, are created in an abstract way by getting information from people who know the subject area. A system may not implement all the entities in a logical model, but the model serves as a reference point or template.[7]\nSometimes models are created in a mixture of the two methods: by considering the data needs and structure of an application and by consistently referencing a subject-area model. In many environments, the distinction between a logical data model and a physical data model is blurred. In addition, some CASE tools don't make a distinction between logical and physical data models.[7]\nEntity–relationship diagrams\n[edit]There are several notations for data modeling. The actual model is frequently called \"entity–relationship model\", because it depicts data in terms of the entities and relationships described in the data.[4] An entity–relationship model (ERM) is an abstract conceptual representation of structured data. Entity–relationship modeling is a relational schema database modeling method, used in software engineering to produce a type of conceptual data model (or semantic data model) of a system, often a relational database, and its requirements in a top-down fashion.\nThese models are being used in the first stage of information system design during the requirements analysis to describe information needs or the type of information that is to be stored in a database. The data modeling technique can be used to describe any ontology (i.e. an overview and classifications of used terms and their relationships) for a certain universe of discourse i.e. the area of interest.\nSeveral techniques have been developed for the design of data models. While these methodologies guide data modelers in their work, two different people using the same methodology will often come up with very different results. Most notable are:\n- Bachman diagrams\n- Barker's notation\n- Chen's notation\n- Data Vault Modeling\n- Extended Backus–Naur form\n- IDEF1X\n- Object-relational mapping\n- Object-Role Modeling and Fully Communication Oriented Information Modeling\n- Relational Model\n- Relational Model/Tasmania\nGeneric data modeling\n[edit]Generic data models are generalizations of conventional data models. They define standardized general relation types, together with the kinds of things that may be related by such a relation type. The definition of the generic data model is similar to the definition of a natural language. For example, a generic data model may define relation types such as a 'classification relation', being a binary relation between an individual thing and a kind of thing (a class) and a 'part-whole relation', being a binary relation between two things, one with the role of part, the other with the role of whole, regardless the kind of things that are related.\nGiven an extensible list of classes, this allows the classification of any individual thing and to specification of part-whole relations for any individual object. By standardization of an extensible list of relation types, a generic data model enables the expression of an unlimited number of kinds of facts and will approach the capabilities of natural languages. Conventional data models, on the other hand, have a fixed and limited domain scope, because the instantiation (usage) of such a model only allows expressions of kinds of facts that are predefined in the model.\nSemantic data modeling\n[edit]The logical data structure of a DBMS, whether hierarchical, network, or relational, cannot totally satisfy the requirements for a conceptual definition of data because it is limited in scope and biased toward the implementation strategy employed by the DBMS. That is unless the semantic data model is implemented in the database on purpose, a choice which may slightly impact performance but generally vastly improves productivity.\nTherefore, the need to define data from a conceptual view has led to the development of semantic data modeling techniques. That is, techniques to define the meaning of data within the context of its interrelationships with other data. As illustrated in the figure the real world, in terms of resources, ideas, events, etc., is symbolically defined by its description within physical data stores. A semantic data model is an abstraction which defines how the stored symbols relate to the real world. Thus, the model must be a true representation of the real world.[8]\nThe purpose of semantic data modeling is to create a structural model of a piece of the real world, called \"universe of discourse\". For this, three fundamental structural relations are considered:\n- Classification/instantiation: Objects with some structural similarity are described as instances of classes\n- Aggregation/decomposition: Composed objects are obtained by joining their parts\n- Generalization/specialization: Distinct classes with some common properties are reconsidered in a more generic class with the common attributes\nA semantic data model can be used to serve many purposes, such as:[8]\n- Planning of data resources\n- Building of shareable databases\n- Evaluation of vendor software\n- Integration of existing databases\nThe overall goal of semantic data models is to capture more meaning of data by integrating relational concepts with more powerful abstraction concepts known from the artificial intelligence field. The idea is to provide high-level modeling primitives as integral parts of a data model in order to facilitate the representation of real-world situations.[10]\nSee also\n[edit]- Architectural pattern\n- Comparison of data modeling tools\n- Data (computer science)\n- Data dictionary\n- Document modeling\n- Enterprise data modelling\n- Entity Data Model\n- Information management\n- Information model\n- Building information modeling\n- Metadata modeling\n- Three-schema approach\n- Zachman Framework\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ a b c d e f Matthew West and Julian Fowler (1999).

          "content": "Fragmentation (reproduction)\nFragmentation in multicellular or colonial organisms is a form of asexual reproduction or cloning, where an organism is split into fragments upon maturation and the split part becomes the new individual.\nThe organism may develop specific organs or zones to shed or be easily broken off. If the splitting occurs without the prior preparation of the organism, both fragments must be able to regenerate the complete organism for it to function as reproduction.\nFragmentation as a method of reproduction is seen in organisms such as spirogyra, filamentous cyanobacteria, molds, lichens, sponges, acoel flatworms, some annelid worms and sea stars.\nFragmentation in various organisms\n[edit]Molds, yeasts and mushrooms, all of which are part of the Fungi kingdom, produce tiny filaments called hyphae. These hyphae obtain food and nutrients from the body of other organisms to grow and fertilize. Then a piece of hyphae breaks off and grows into a new individual and the cycle continues.\nMany lichens produce specialized structures that can easily break away and disperse. These structures contain both hyphae of the mycobiont and the algae (phycobiont) (see soredia and isidia). Larger fragments of the thallus may break away when the lichen dries or due to mechanical disturbances (see the section on reproduction in lichens).\nPlants\n[edit]Fragmentation is a very common type of vegetative reproduction in plants. Many trees, shrubs, nonwoody perennials, and ferns form clonal colonies by producing new rooted shoots by rhizomes or stolons, which increases the diameter of the colony. If a rooted shoot becomes detached from the colony, then fragmentation has occurred. There are several other mechanisms of natural fragmentation in plants.\n- Production of specialized reproductive structures: A few plants produce adventitious plantlets on their leaves, which drop off and form independent plants, e.g. Tolmiea menziesii and Kalanchoe daigremontiana. Others produce organs like bulbils and turions.\n- Easily lost parts that have high potential to grow into a complete plant: Some woody plants like the willow naturally shed twigs. This is termed cladoptosis. The lost twigs may form roots in a suitable environment to establish a new plant. River currents often tear off branch fragments from certain cottonwood species growing on riverbanks. Fragments reaching suitable environments can root and establish new plants.[1] Some cacti and other plants have jointed stems. When a stem segment, called a pad, falls off, it can root and form a new plant. Leaves of some plants readily root when they fall off, e.g. Sedum and Echeveria.\n- Fragmentation is observed in nonvascular plants as well, for example, in liverworts and mosses. Small pieces of moss \"stems\" or \"leaves\" are often scattered by the wind, water or animals. If a moss fragment reaches a suitable environment, it can establish a new plant.[2] They also produce gemmae, for example in the splash-cups of Marchantia polymorpha,[3] that are easily broken off and distributed.\nPeople use fragmentation to artificially propagate many plants via division, layering, cuttings, grafting, micropropagation and storage organs, such as bulbs, corms, tubers and rhizomes.\nMany algae too, spirogyra for example also fragment, the mother plant breaks into two or more smaller fragments which then grow independently. After growing these individual spirogyra fragment, repeating the cycle.\nAnimals\n[edit]Sponges and coral colonies naturally fragment and reproduce. Many species of annelids and flatworms produce by this method. When the splitting occurs due to specific developmental changes, the terms orchiectomy, laparotomy, and budding are used. In 'architomy' the animal splits at a particular point and the two fragments regenerate the missing organs and tissues. The splitting is not preceded by the development of the tissues to be lost. Before splitting, the animal may develop furrows at the zone of splitting. The headless fragment must regenerate a completely new head. In 'paratomy', the split occurs perpendicular to the antero-posterior axis and the split is preceded by the \"pregeneration\" of the anterior structures in the posterior portion. The two organisms have their body axis aligned i.e. they develop in a head to tail fashion. Budding is similar to paratomy except that the body axes need not be aligned: the new head may grow toward the side or even point backward (e.g. Convolutriloba retrogemma an acoel flat worm).[4][5]\nCoral\n[edit]Many types of coral colonies can increase in number by fragmentation occurring naturally[6] or artificially. Reef aquarium enthusiasts fragment corals for various purposes including shape control; sharing with others; regrowth experiments; and minimizing damage to natural coral reefs. Both hard and soft corals can be fragmented. Genera highly tolerant of fragmentation include Acropora, Montipora, Pocillopora, Euphyllia, and Caulastraea among others.[7] Most sea anemones reproduce through fragmentation via a variety of methods including longitudinal fission, where the original anemone splits across the middle forming two equal-sized anemones, and basal laceration, in which small parts of the animal split from the base to form new anemones.[8]\nEchinoderms\n[edit]In echinoderms, the process is usually known as fissiparity (a term also used infrequently for biological fission in general). Some species can intentionally reproduce in this manner through autotomy. This method is more common during the larval editing stages.[9]\nDisadvantage of this process of reproduction\n[edit]As this process is a form of asexual reproduction, it does not produce genetic diversity in the offspring. Therefore, these are more vulnerable to changing environments, parasites, and diseases.\nSee also\n[edit]References\n[edit]- ^ Rood, S.B., Kalischuk, M.L., and Braatne, J.H. 2003.

          "content": "Fragmentation (weaponry)\nFragmentation is the process by which the casing, shot, or other components of an anti-personnel weapon, bomb, barrel bomb, land mine, IED, artillery, mortar, tank gun, autocannon shell, rocket, missile, grenade, etc. are dispersed and/or shattered by the detonation of the explosive filler.\nThe correct term for those pieces is \"fragments” (nicknamed “splinters” or “shards”).[1] Preformed fragments can be of various shapes (spheres, cubes, rods, etc.) and sizes and are normally held rigidly within some form of matrix or body until the high explosive (HE) filling is detonated. The resulting high-velocity fragments produced by either method are the main lethal mechanisms of these weapons, rather than the heat or overpressure caused by detonation, although offensive grenades are often constructed without a frag matrix.[citation needed]\nThe casing pieces are often incorrectly referred to as \"shrapnel\", particularly by non-military media sources.[1][2][3]\nA fragmentation sleeve is a sleeve that fits onto an explosive weapon to provide fragmentation effect. Offensive grenades can be converted into a fragmentation grenade using an add-on sleeve.[4]\nHistory\n[edit]The use of fragmentation in bombs dates to the 14th century, and appears in the Ming Dynasty text Huolongjing. The fragmentation bombs were filled with iron pellets and pieces of broken porcelain. Once the bomb explodes, the resulting fragments are capable of piercing the skin and blinding enemy soldiers.[5]\nFor this bomb you take tung oil, yin hsiu, salammoniac, chin chih, scallion juice, and heat them so as to coat a lot of iron pellets and bits of broken porcelain. Then fill in (with a gunpowder core) to a case of cast iron making a fragmentation bomb. When it bursts, it breaks into pieces that wound the skin and break the bones (of enemy soldiers) and blinds their eyes.\n— Huolongjing, Part 1 Chapter 2[5]\nThe modern fragmentation grenade was developed during the 20th century. The Mills bomb, first adopted in 1915 by the British army, is an early fragmentation grenade used in World War I. The Mk 2 grenade was a fragmentation grenade adopted by the American military based on the Mills bomb, and was in use during World War II.[6]\nDifference between fragmentation and shrapnel shells\n[edit]The term \"shrapnel\" is commonly, although incorrectly from a technical standpoint, used to refer to fragments produced by any explosive weapon. However, the shrapnel shell, named for Major General Henry Shrapnel of the British Royal Artillery, predates the modern high-explosive shell and operates by an entirely different process.[2]\nA shrapnel shell consists of a shell casing filled with steel or lead balls suspended in a resin matrix, with a small explosive charge at the base of the shell. When the projectile is fired, it travels a pre-set distance along a ballistic trajectory, then the fuse ignites a relatively weak secondary charge (often black powder or cordite) in the base of the shell. This charge fractures the matrix holding the balls in place and expels the nose of the shell to open a path for the balls, which are then propelled out of the front of the shell without rupturing the casing (which falls to earth relatively unharmed and can be retrieved and reused).[7] These balls continue onward to the target, spreading out in a cone-shaped pattern at ground level, with most of their energy coming from the original velocity of the shell itself rather than the lesser force of the secondary charge that freed them from the shell. Since the cone of impact is relatively small, no more than 10 to 15 times the diameter of the shell, true shrapnel shells needed to be carefully sighted and judiciously used in order to maximize their impact on the enemy.\nIn contrast, a high-explosive shell contains a relatively large and energetic secondary charge of high explosive (known as a burster charge) which, when ignited by the fuse, produces a powerful supersonic shock wave that shatters the entire shell casing into many fragments that fly in all directions.[8] The use of high explosives with a fragmenting case improves efficiency as well as propelling a larger number of fragments at a higher velocity over a much wider area (40 to 60 times the diameter of the shell), giving high-explosive shells a vastly superior battlefield lethality that was largely impossible before the Industrial Era. World War I was the first major conflict in which HE shells were the dominant form of artillery; the failure to adapt infantry tactics to the massive increase in lethality they produced was a major element in producing the ghastly subterranean stalemate conditions of trench warfare, in which neither side could risk movement above ground without the guarantee of instant casualties from the constant, indiscriminate hail of HE shell fragments.\nOne easy comparison between fragmenting HE and shrapnel shells would be to imagine a shell of each type standing stationary and base-first on the ground; a high-explosive shell would be equally lethal if detonated in this state vs. detonating on impact after being fired, whereas a shrapnel shell would ineffectually fire its contents only a few feet into the air in a cone-shaped pattern (while the casing itself remained intact).[2] However, the reduced area of effect of shrapnel shells can be exploited, such as in the creeping barrage tactics of World War I, where shrapnel shells were able to be used much closer to friendly infantry than HE shells could.\nGallery of images\n[edit]-\nEarly artillery shell, with the fragments it would generate. 1900\n-\nArtillery shell fragment from the Gulf War\n-\nGrenade fragments in the soft tissue of the lower leg (along with an old fracture of the fibula)\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ a b Fawcett, Kirstin (20 February 2020). \"The Difference Between 'Shell Fragments' and 'Shrapnel'\".

          "content": "Fragmentation (computing)\nIn computer storage, fragmentation is a phenomenon in the computer system which involves the distribution of data in to smaller pieces which storage space, such as computer memory or a hard drive, is used inefficiently, reducing capacity or performance and often both. The exact consequences of fragmentation depend on the specific system of storage allocation in use and the particular form of fragmentation. In many cases, fragmentation leads to storage space being \"wasted\", and programs will tend to run inefficiently due to the shortage of memory.\nBasic principle\n[edit]In main memory fragmentation, when a computer program requests blocks of memory from the computer system, the blocks are allocated in chunks. When the computer program is finished with a chunk, it can free it back to the system, making it available to later be allocated again to another or the same program. The size and the amount of time a chunk is held by a program varies. During its lifespan, a computer program can request and free many chunks of memory.\nFragmentation can occur when a block of memory is requested by a program, and is allocated to that program, but the program has not freed it.[1] This leads to theoretically \"available\", unused memory, being marked as allocated - which reduces the amount of globally available memory, making it harder for programs to request and access memory.\nWhen a program is started, the free memory areas are long and contiguous. Over time and with use, the long contiguous regions become fragmented into smaller and smaller contiguous areas. Eventually, it may become impossible for the program to obtain large contiguous chunks of memory.\nTypes\n[edit]There are three different but related forms of fragmentation: external fragmentation, internal fragmentation, and data fragmentation, which can be present in isolation or conjunction. Fragmentation is often accepted in return for improvements in speed or simplicity. Analogous phenomena occur for other resources such as processors; see below.\nInternal fragmentation\n[edit]Memory paging creates internal fragmentation because an entire page frame will be allocated whether or not that much storage is needed.[2] Due to the rules governing memory allocation, more computer memory is sometimes allocated than is needed. For example, memory can only be provided to programs in chunks (usually a multiple of 4 bytes), and as a result if a program requests perhaps 29 bytes, it will actually get a chunk of 32 bytes. When this happens, the excess memory goes to waste. In this scenario, the unusable memory, known as slack space, is contained within an allocated region. This arrangement, termed fixed partitions, suffers from inefficient memory use - any process, no matter how small, occupies an entire partition. This waste is called internal fragmentation.[3][4]\nUnlike other types of fragmentation, internal fragmentation is difficult to reclaim; usually the best way to remove it is with a design change. For example, in dynamic memory allocation, memory pools drastically cut internal fragmentation by spreading the space overhead over a larger number of objects.\nExternal fragmentation\n[edit]External fragmentation arises when free memory is separated into small blocks and is interspersed by allocated memory. It is a weakness of certain storage allocation algorithms, when they fail to order memory used by programs efficiently. The result is that, although free storage is available, it is effectively unusable because it is divided into pieces that are too small individually to satisfy the demands of the application. The term \"external\" refers to the fact that the unusable storage is outside the allocated regions.\nFor example, consider a situation wherein a program allocates three continuous blocks of memory and then frees the middle block. The memory allocator can use this free block of memory for future allocations. However, it cannot use this block if the memory to be allocated is larger in size than this free block.\nExternal fragmentation also occurs in file systems as many files of different sizes are created, change size, and are deleted. The effect is even worse if a file which is divided into many small pieces is deleted, because this leaves similarly small regions of free spaces.\nData fragmentation\n[edit]Data fragmentation occurs when a collection of data in memory is broken up into many pieces that are not close together. It is typically the result of attempting to insert a large object into storage that has already suffered external fragmentation. For example, files in a file system are usually managed in units called blocks or clusters. When a file system is created, there is free space to store file blocks together contiguously. This allows for rapid sequential file reads and writes. However, as files are added, removed, and changed in size, the free space becomes externally fragmented, leaving only small holes in which to place new data. When a new file is written, or when an existing file is extended, the operating system puts the new data in new non-contiguous data blocks to fit into the available holes. The new data blocks are necessarily scattered, slowing access due to seek time and rotational latency of the read/write head, and incurring additional overhead to manage additional locations. This is called file system fragmentation.\nWhen writing a new file of a known size, if there are any empty holes that are larger than that file, the operating system can avoid data fragmentation by putting the file into any one of those holes. There are a variety of algorithms for selecting which of those potential holes to put the file; each of them is a heuristic approximate solution to the bin packing problem. The \"best fit\" algorithm chooses the smallest hole that is big enough. The \"worst fit\" algorithm chooses the largest hole. The \"first-fit algorithm\" chooses the first hole that is big enough. The \"next fit\" algorithm keeps track of where each file was written. The \"next fit\" algorithm is faster than \"first fit,\" which is in turn faster than \"best fit,\" which is the same speed as \"worst fit\".[5]\nJust as compaction can eliminate external fragmentation, data fragmentation can be eliminated by rearranging data storage so that related pieces are close together. For example, the primary job of a defragmentation tool is to rearrange blocks on disk so that the blocks of each file are contiguous. Most defragmenting utilities also attempt to reduce or eliminate free space fragmentation. Some moving garbage collectors, utilities that perform automatic memory management, will also move related objects close together (this is called compacting) to improve cache performance.\nThere are four kinds of systems that never experience data fragmentation—they always store every file contiguously. All four kinds have significant disadvantages compared to systems that allow at least some temporary data fragmentation:\n- Simply write each file contiguously. If there isn't already enough contiguous free space to hold the file, the system immediately fails to store the file—even when there are many little bits of free space from deleted files that add up to more than enough to store the file.\n- If there isn't already enough contiguous free space to hold the file, use a copying collector to convert many little bits of free space into one contiguous free region big enough to hold the file. This takes a lot more time than breaking the file up into fragments and putting those fragments into the available free space.\n- Write the file into any free block, through fixed-size blocks storage. If a programmer picks a fixed block size too small, the system immediately fails to store some files—files larger than the block size—even when there are many free blocks that add up to more than enough to store the file. If a programmer picks a block size too big, a lot of space is wasted on internal fragmentation.\n- Some systems avoid dynamic allocation entirely, pre-storing (contiguous) space for all possible files they will need—for example, MultiFinder pre-allocates a chunk of RAM to each application as it was started according to how much RAM that application's programmer claimed it would need.\nComparison\n[edit]Compared to external fragmentation, overhead and internal fragmentation account for little loss in terms of wasted memory and reduced performance. It is defined as:\nFragmentation of 0% means that all the free memory is in a single large block; fragmentation is 90% (for example) when 100 MB free memory is present but largest free block of memory for storage is just 10 MB.\nExternal fragmentation tends to be less of a problem in file systems than in primary memory (RAM) storage systems, because programs usually require their RAM storage requests to be fulfilled with contiguous blocks, but file systems typically are designed to be able to use any collection of available blocks (fragments) to assemble a file which logically appears contiguous. Therefore, if a highly fragmented file or many small files are deleted from a full volume and then a new file with size equal to the newly freed space is created, the new file will simply reuse the same fragments that were freed by the deletion. If what was deleted was one file, the new file will be just as fragmented as that old file was, but in any case there will be no barrier to using all the (highly fragmented) free space to create the new file. In RAM, on the other hand, the storage systems used often cannot assemble a large block to meet a request from small noncontiguous free blocks, and so the request cannot be fulfilled and the program cannot proceed to do whatever it needed that memory for (unless it can reissue the request as a number of smaller separate requests).\nProblems\n[edit]Storage failure\n[edit]The most severe problem caused by fragmentation is causing a process or system to fail, due to premature resource exhaustion: if a contiguous block must be stored and cannot be stored, failure occurs. Fragmentation causes this to occur even if there is enough of the resource, but not a contiguous amount. For example, if a computer has 4 GiB of memory and 2 GiB are free, but the memory is fragmented in an alternating sequence of 1 MiB used, 1 MiB free, then a request for 1 contiguous GiB of memory cannot be satisfied even though 2 GiB total are free.\nIn order to avoid this, the allocator may, instead of failing, trigger a defragmentation (or memory compaction cycle) or other resource reclamation, such as a major garbage collection cycle, in the hope that it will then be able to satisfy the request. This allows the process to proceed, but can severely impact performance.\nPerformance degradation\n[edit]Fragmentation causes performance degradation for a number of reasons. Most basically, fragmentation increases the work required to allocate and access a resource. For example, on a hard drive or tape drive, sequential data reads are very fast, but seeking to a different address is slow, so reading or writing a fragmented file requires numerous seeks and is thus much slower, in addition to causing greater wear on the device. Further, if a resource is not fragmented, allocation requests can simply be satisfied by returning a single block from the start of the free area. However, if it is fragmented, the request requires either searching for a large enough free block, which may take a long time, or fulfilling the request by several smaller blocks (if this is possible), which results in this allocation being fragmented, and requiring additional overhead to manage the several pieces.\nA subtler problem is that fragmentation may prematurely exhaust a cache, causing thrashing, due to caches holding blocks, not individual data. For example, suppose a program has a working set of 256 KiB, and is running on a computer with a 256 KiB cache (say L2 instruction+data cache), so the entire working set fits in cache and thus executes quickly, at least in terms of cache hits. Suppose further that it has 64 translation lookaside buffer (TLB) entries, each for a 4 KiB page: each memory access requires a virtual-to-physical translation, which is fast if the page is in cache (here TLB). If the working set is unfragmented, then it will fit onto exactly 64 pages (the page working set will be 64 pages), and all memory lookups can be served from cache. However, if the working set is fragmented, then it will not fit into 64 pages, and execution will slow due to thrashing: pages will be repeatedly added and removed from the TLB during operation. Thus cache sizing in system design must include margin to account for fragmentation.\nMemory fragmentation is one of the most severe problems faced by system managers.[citation needed] Over time, it leads to degradation of system performance. Eventually, memory fragmentation may lead to complete loss of (application-usable) free memory.\nMemory fragmentation is a kernel programming level problem. During real-time computing of applications, fragmentation levels can reach as high as 99%, and may lead to system crashes or other instabilities.[citation needed] This type of system crash can be difficult to avoid, as it is impossible to anticipate the critical rise in levels of memory fragmentation. However, while it may not be possible for a system to continue running all programs in the case of excessive memory fragmentation, a well-designed system should be able to recover from the critical fragmentation condition by moving in some memory blocks used by the system itself in order to enable consolidation of free memory into fewer, larger blocks, or, in the worst case, by terminating some programs to free their memory and then defragmenting the resulting sum total of free memory. This will at least avoid a true crash in the sense of system failure and allow the system to continue running some programs, save program data, etc.\nFragmentation is a phenomenon of system software design; different software will be susceptible to fragmentation to different degrees, and it is possible to design a system that will never be forced to shut down or kill processes as a result of memory fragmentation.\nAnalogous phenomena\n[edit]While fragmentation is best known as a problem in memory allocation, analogous phenomena occur for other resources, notably processors.[6] For example, in a system that uses time-sharing for preemptive multitasking, but that does not check if a process is blocked, a process that executes for part of its time slice but then blocks and cannot proceed for the remainder of its time slice wastes time because of the resulting internal fragmentation of time slices. More fundamentally, time-sharing itself causes external fragmentation of processes due to running them in fragmented time slices, rather than in a single unbroken run. The resulting cost of process switching and increased cache pressure from multiple processes using the same caches can result in degraded performance.\nIn concurrent systems, particularly distributed systems, when a group of processes must interact in order to progress, if the processes are scheduled at separate times or on separate machines (fragmented across time or machines), the time spent waiting for each other or in communicating with each other can severely degrade performance. Instead, performant systems require coscheduling of the group.[6]\nSome flash file systems have several different kinds of internal fragmentation involving \"dead space\" and \"dark space\".[7]\nSee also\n[edit]- Defragmentation\n- File system fragmentation\n- Memory management\n- Memory management (operating systems)\n- Block (data storage)\n- Data cluster\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ \"CS360 Lecture notes -- Fragmentation\". web.eecs.utk.edu.

          "content": "Cluster analysis\nCluster analysis or clustering is the data analyzing technique in which task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some specific sense defined by the analyst) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). It is a main task of exploratory data analysis, and a common technique for statistical data analysis, used in many fields, including pattern recognition, image analysis, information retrieval, bioinformatics, data compression, computer graphics and machine learning.\nCluster analysis refers to a family of algorithms and tasks rather than one specific algorithm. It can be achieved by various algorithms that differ significantly in their understanding of what constitutes a cluster and how to efficiently find them. Popular notions of clusters include groups with small distances between cluster members, dense areas of the data space, intervals or particular statistical distributions. Clustering can therefore be formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. The appropriate clustering algorithm and parameter settings (including parameters such as the distance function to use, a density threshold or the number of expected clusters) depend on the individual data set and intended use of the results. Cluster analysis as such is not an automatic task, but an iterative process of knowledge discovery or interactive multi-objective optimization that involves trial and failure. It is often necessary to modify data preprocessing and model parameters until the result achieves the desired properties.\nBesides the term clustering, there are a number of terms with similar meanings, including automatic classification, numerical taxonomy, botryology (from Greek: βότρυς 'grape'), typological analysis, and community detection. The subtle differences are often in the use of the results: while in data mining, the resulting groups are the matter of interest, in automatic classification the resulting discriminative power is of interest.\nCluster analysis originated in anthropology by Driver and Kroeber in 1932[1] and introduced to psychology by Joseph Zubin in 1938[2] and Robert Tryon in 1939[3] and famously used by Cattell beginning in 1943[4] for trait theory classification in personality psychology.\nDefinition\n[edit]The notion of a \"cluster\" cannot be precisely defined, which is one of the reasons why there are so many clustering algorithms.[5] There is a common denominator: a group of data objects. However, different researchers employ different cluster models, and for each of these cluster models again different algorithms can be given. The notion of a cluster, as found by different algorithms, varies significantly in its properties. Understanding these \"cluster models\" is key to understanding the differences between the various algorithms. Typical cluster models include:\n- Connectivity models: for example, hierarchical clustering builds models based on distance connectivity.\n- Centroid models: for example, the k-means algorithm represents each cluster by a single mean vector.\n- Distribution models: clusters are modeled using statistical distributions, such as multivariate normal distributions used by the expectation-maximization algorithm.\n- Density models: for example, DBSCAN and OPTICS defines clusters as connected dense regions in the data space.\n- Subspace models: in biclustering (also known as co-clustering or two-mode-clustering), clusters are modeled with both cluster members and relevant attributes.\n- Group models: some algorithms do not provide a refined model for their results and just provide the grouping information.\n- Graph-based models: a clique, that is, a subset of nodes in a graph such that every two nodes in the subset are connected by an edge can be considered as a prototypical form of cluster. Relaxations of the complete connectivity requirement (a fraction of the edges can be missing) are known as quasi-cliques, as in the HCS clustering algorithm.\n- Signed graph models: Every path in a signed graph has a sign from the product of the signs on the edges. Under the assumptions of balance theory, edges may change sign and result in a bifurcated graph. The weaker \"clusterability axiom\" (no cycle has exactly one negative edge) yields results with more than two clusters, or subgraphs with only positive edges.[6]\n- Neural models: the most well-known unsupervised neural network is the self-organizing map and these models can usually be characterized as similar to one or more of the above models, and including subspace models when neural networks implement a form of Principal Component Analysis or Independent Component Analysis.\nA \"clustering\" is essentially a set of such clusters, usually containing all objects in the data set. Additionally, it may specify the relationship of the clusters to each other, for example, a hierarchy of clusters embedded in each other. Clusterings can be roughly distinguished as:\n- Hard clustering: each object belongs to a cluster or not\n- Soft clustering (also: fuzzy clustering): each object belongs to each cluster to a certain degree (for example, a likelihood of belonging to the cluster)\nThere are also finer distinctions possible, for example:\n- Strict partitioning clustering: each object belongs to exactly one cluster\n- Strict partitioning clustering with outliers: objects can also belong to no cluster; in which case they are considered outliers\n- Overlapping clustering (also: alternative clustering, multi-view clustering): objects may belong to more than one cluster; usually involving hard clusters\n- Hierarchical clustering: objects that belong to a child cluster also belong to the parent cluster\n- Subspace clustering: while an overlapping clustering, within a uniquely defined subspace, clusters are not expected to overlap\nAlgorithms\n[edit]As listed above, clustering algorithms can be categorized based on their cluster model. The following overview will only list the most prominent examples of clustering algorithms, as there are possibly over 100 published clustering algorithms. Not all provide models for their clusters and can thus not easily be categorized. An overview of algorithms explained in Wikipedia can be found in the list of statistics algorithms.\nThere is no objectively \"correct\" clustering algorithm, but as it was noted, \"clustering is in the eye of the beholder.\"[5] In fact, an axiomatic approach to clustering demonstrates that it is impossible for any clustering method to meet three fundamental properties simultaneously: scale invariance (results remain unchanged under proportional scaling of distances), richness (all possible partitions of the data can be achieved), and consistency between distances and the clustering structure.[7] The most appropriate clustering algorithm for a particular problem often needs to be chosen experimentally, unless there is a mathematical reason to prefer one cluster model over another. An algorithm that is designed for one kind of model will generally fail on a data set that contains a radically different kind of model.[5] For example, k-means cannot find non-convex clusters.[5] Most traditional clustering methods assume the clusters exhibit a spherical, elliptical or convex shape.[8]\nConnectivity-based clustering (hierarchical clustering)\n[edit]Connectivity-based clustering, also known as hierarchical clustering, is based on the core idea of objects being more related to nearby objects than to objects farther away. These algorithms connect \"objects\" to form \"clusters\" based on their distance. A cluster can be described largely by the maximum distance needed to connect parts of the cluster. At different distances, different clusters will form, which can be represented using a dendrogram, which explains where the common name \"hierarchical clustering\" comes from: these algorithms do not provide a single partitioning of the data set, but instead provide an extensive hierarchy of clusters that merge with each other at certain distances. In a dendrogram, the y-axis marks the distance at which the clusters merge, while the objects are placed along the x-axis such that the clusters don't mix.\nConnectivity-based clustering is a whole family of methods that differ by the way distances are computed. Apart from the usual choice of distance functions, the user also needs to decide on the linkage criterion (since a cluster consists of multiple objects, there are multiple candidates to compute the distance) to use. Popular choices are known as single-linkage clustering (the minimum of object distances), complete linkage clustering (the maximum of object distances), and UPGMA or WPGMA (\"Unweighted or Weighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean\", also known as average linkage clustering). Furthermore, hierarchical clustering can be agglomerative (starting with single elements and aggregating them into clusters) or divisive (starting with the complete data set and dividing it into partitions).\nThese methods will not produce a unique partitioning of the data set, but a hierarchy from which the user still needs to choose appropriate clusters. They are not very robust towards outliers, which will either show up as additional clusters or even cause other clusters to merge (known as \"chaining phenomenon\", in particular with single-linkage clustering). In the general case, the complexity is for agglomerative clustering and for divisive clustering,[9] which makes them too slow for large data sets. For some special cases, optimal efficient methods (of complexity ) are known: SLINK[10] for single-linkage and CLINK[11] for complete-linkage clustering.\n-\nSingle-linkage on Gaussian data. At 35 clusters, the biggest cluster starts fragmenting into smaller parts, while before it was still connected to the second largest due to the single-link effect.\n-\nSingle-linkage on density-based clusters. 20 clusters extracted, most of which contain single elements, since linkage clustering does not have a notion of \"noise\".\nCentroid-based clustering\n[edit]In centroid-based clustering, each cluster is represented by a central vector, which is not necessarily a member of the data set. When the number of clusters is fixed to k, k-means clustering gives a formal definition as an optimization problem: find the k cluster centers and assign the objects to the nearest cluster center, such that the squared distances from the cluster are minimized.\nThe optimization problem itself is known to be NP-hard, and thus the common approach is to search only for approximate solutions. A particularly well-known approximate method is Lloyd's algorithm,[12] often just referred to as \"k-means algorithm\" (although another algorithm introduced this name). It does however only find a local optimum, and is commonly run multiple times with different random initializations. Variations of k-means often include such optimizations as choosing the best of multiple runs, but also restricting the centroids to members of the data set (k-medoids), choosing medians (k-medians clustering), choosing the initial centers less randomly (k-means++) or allowing a fuzzy cluster assignment (fuzzy c-means).\nMost k-means-type algorithms require the number of clusters – k – to be specified in advance, which is considered to be one of the biggest drawbacks of these algorithms. Furthermore, the algorithms prefer clusters of approximately similar size, as they will always assign an object to the nearest centroid; often yielding improperly cut borders of clusters. This happens primarily because the algorithm optimizes cluster centers, not cluster borders. Steps involved in the centroid-based clustering algorithm are:\n- Choose, k distinct clusters at random. These are the initial centroids to be improved upon.\n- Suppose a set of observations, (x1, x2, ..., xn). Assign each observation to the centroid to which it has the smallest squared Euclidean distance. This results in k distinct groups, each containing unique observations.\n- Recalculate centroids (see k-means clustering).\n- Exit iff the new centroids are equivalent to the previous iteration's centroids. Else, repeat the algorithm, the centroids have yet to converge.\nK-means has a number of interesting theoretical properties. First, it partitions the data space into a structure known as a Voronoi diagram. Second, it is conceptually close to nearest neighbor classification, and as such is popular in machine learning. Third, it can be seen as a variation of model-based clustering, and Lloyd's algorithm as a variation of the Expectation-maximization algorithm for this model discussed below.\n-\nk-means separates data into Voronoi cells, which assumes equal-sized clusters (not adequate here).\n-\nk-means cannot represent density-based clusters.\nCentroid-based clustering problems such as k-means and k-medoids are special cases of the uncapacitated, metric facility location problem, a canonical problem in the operations research and computational geometry communities. In a basic facility location problem (of which there are numerous variants that model more elaborate settings), the task is to find the best warehouse locations to optimally service a given set of consumers. One may view \"warehouses\" as cluster centroids and \"consumer locations\" as the data to be clustered. This makes it possible to apply the well-developed algorithmic solutions from the facility location literature to the presently considered centroid-based clustering problem.\nModel-based clustering\n[edit]The clustering framework most closely related to statistics is model-based clustering, which is based on distribution models. This approach models the data as arising from a mixture of probability distributions. It has the advantages of providing principled statistical answers to questions such as how many clusters there are, what clustering method or model to use, and how to detect and deal with outliers.\nWhile the theoretical foundation of these methods is excellent, they suffer from overfitting unless constraints are put on the model complexity. A more complex model will usually be able to explain the data better, which makes choosing the appropriate model complexity inherently difficult. Standard model-based clustering methods include more parsimonious models based on the eigenvalue decomposition of the covariance matrices, that provide a balance between overfitting and fidelity to the data.\nOne prominent method is known as Gaussian mixture models (using the expectation-maximization algorithm). Here, the data set is usually modeled with a fixed (to avoid overfitting) number of Gaussian distributions that are initialized randomly and whose parameters are iteratively optimized to better fit the data set. This will converge to a local optimum, so multiple runs may produce different results. In order to obtain a hard clustering, objects are often then assigned to the Gaussian distribution they most likely belong to; for soft clusterings, this is not necessary.\nDistribution-based clustering produces complex models for clusters that can capture correlation and dependence between attributes. However, these algorithms put an extra burden on the user: for many real data sets, there may be no concisely defined mathematical model (e.g. assuming Gaussian distributions is a rather strong assumption on the data).\n-\nOn Gaussian-distributed data, EM works well, since it uses Gaussians for modelling clusters.\n-\nDensity-based clusters cannot be modeled using Gaussian distributions.\nDensity-based clustering\n[edit]In density-based clustering,[13] clusters are defined as areas of higher density than the remainder of the data set. Objects in sparse areas – that are required to separate clusters – are usually considered to be noise and border points.\nThe most popular[14] density-based clustering method is DBSCAN.[15] In contrast to many newer methods, it features a well-defined cluster model called \"density-reachability\". Similar to linkage-based clustering, it is based on connecting points within certain distance thresholds. However, it only connects points that satisfy a density criterion, in the original variant defined as a minimum number of other objects within this radius. A cluster consists of all density-connected objects (which can form a cluster of an arbitrary shape, in contrast to many other methods) plus all objects that are within these objects' range. Another interesting property of DBSCAN is that its complexity is fairly low – it requires a linear number of range queries on the database – and that it will discover essentially the same results (it is deterministic for core and noise points, but not for border points) in each run, therefore there is no need to run it multiple times. OPTICS[16] is a generalization of DBSCAN that removes the need to choose an appropriate value for the range parameter , and produces a hierarchical result related to that of linkage clustering. DeLi-Clu,[17] Density-Link-Clustering combines ideas from single-linkage clustering and OPTICS, eliminating the parameter entirely and offering performance improvements over OPTICS by using an R-tree index.\nThe key drawback of DBSCAN and OPTICS is that they expect some kind of density drop to detect cluster borders. On data sets with, for example, overlapping Gaussian distributions – a common use case in artificial data – the cluster borders produced by these algorithms will often look arbitrary, because the cluster density decreases continuously. On a data set consisting of mixtures of Gaussians, these algorithms are nearly always outperformed by methods such as EM clustering that are able to precisely model this kind of data.\nMean-shift is a clustering approach where each object is moved to the densest area in its vicinity, based on kernel density estimation. Eventually, objects converge to local maxima of density. Similar to k-means clustering, these \"density attractors\" can serve as representatives for the data set, but mean-shift can detect arbitrary-shaped clusters similar to DBSCAN. Due to the expensive iterative procedure and density estimation, mean-shift is usually slower than DBSCAN or k-Means. Besides that, the applicability of the mean-shift algorithm to multidimensional data is hindered by the unsmooth behaviour of the kernel density estimate, which results in over-fragmentation of cluster tails.[17]\n-\nDensity-based clustering with DBSCAN\n-\nDBSCAN assumes clusters of similar density, and may have problems separating nearby clusters.\n-\nOPTICS is a DBSCAN variant, improving handling of different densities clusters.\nGrid-based clustering\n[edit]The grid-based technique is used for a multi-dimensional data set.[18] In this technique, we create a grid structure, and the comparison is performed on grids (also known as cells). The grid-based technique is fast and has low computational complexity. There are two types of grid-based clustering methods: STING and CLIQUE. Steps involved in the grid-based clustering algorithm are:\n- Divide data space into a finite number of cells.\n- Randomly select a cell ‘c’, where c should not be traversed beforehand.\n- Calculate the density of ‘c’\n- If the density of ‘c’ greater than threshold density\n- Mark cell ‘c’ as a new cluster\n- Calculate the density of all the neighbors of ‘c’\n- If the density of a neighboring cell is greater than threshold density then, add the cell in the cluster and repeat steps 4.2 and 4.3 till there is no neighbor with a density greater than threshold density.\n- Repeat steps 2,3 and 4 till all the cells are traversed.\n- Stop.\nRecent developments\n[edit]In recent years, considerable effort has been put into improving the performance of existing algorithms.[19][20] Among them are CLARANS,[21] and BIRCH.[22] With the recent need to process larger and larger data sets (also known as big data), the willingness to trade semantic meaning of the generated clusters for performance has been increasing. This led to the development of pre-clustering methods such as canopy clustering, which can process huge data sets efficiently, but the resulting \"clusters\" are merely a rough pre-partitioning of the data set to then analyze the partitions with existing slower methods such as k-means clustering.\nFor high-dimensional data, many of the existing methods fail due to the curse of dimensionality, which renders particular distance functions problematic in high-dimensional spaces. This led to new clustering algorithms for high-dimensional data that focus on subspace clustering (where only some attributes are used, and cluster models include the relevant attributes for the cluster) and correlation clustering that also looks for arbitrary rotated (\"correlated\") subspace clusters that can be modeled by giving a correlation of their attributes.[23] Examples for such clustering algorithms are CLIQUE[24] and SUBCLU.[25]\nIdeas from density-based clustering methods (in particular the DBSCAN/OPTICS family of algorithms) have been adapted to subspace clustering (HiSC,[26] hierarchical subspace clustering and DiSH[27]) and correlation clustering (HiCO,[28] hierarchical correlation clustering, 4C[29] using \"correlation connectivity\" and ERiC[30] exploring hierarchical density-based correlation clusters).\nSeveral different clustering systems based on mutual information have been proposed. One is Marina Meilă's variation of information metric;[31] another provides hierarchical clustering.[32] Using genetic algorithms, a wide range of different fit-functions can be optimized, including mutual information.[33] Also belief propagation, a recent development in computer science and statistical physics, has led to the creation of new types of clustering algorithms.[34]\nEvaluation and assessment\n[edit]Evaluation (or \"validation\") of clustering results is as difficult as the clustering itself.[35] Popular approaches involve \"internal\" evaluation, where the clustering is summarized to a single quality score, \"external\" evaluation, where the clustering is compared to an existing \"ground truth\" classification, \"manual\" evaluation by a human expert, and \"indirect\" evaluation by evaluating the utility of the clustering in its intended application.[36]\nInternal evaluation measures suffer from the problem that they represent functions that themselves can be seen as a clustering objective. For example, one could cluster the data set by the Silhouette coefficient; except that there is no known efficient algorithm for this. By using such an internal measure for evaluation, one rather compares the similarity of the optimization problems,[36] and not necessarily how useful the clustering is.\nExternal evaluation has similar problems: if we have such \"ground truth\" labels, then we would not need to cluster; and in practical applications we usually do not have such labels. On the other hand, the labels only reflect one possible partitioning of the data set, which does not imply that there does not exist a different, and maybe even better, clustering.\nNeither of these approaches can therefore ultimately judge the actual quality of a clustering, but this needs human evaluation,[36] which is highly subjective. Nevertheless, such statistics can be quite informative in identifying bad clusterings,[37] but one should not dismiss subjective human evaluation.[37]\nInternal evaluation\n[edit]When a clustering result is evaluated based on the data that was clustered itself, this is called internal evaluation. These methods usually assign the best score to the algorithm that produces clusters with high similarity within a cluster and low similarity between clusters. One drawback of using internal criteria in cluster evaluation is that high scores on an internal measure do not necessarily result in effective information retrieval applications.[38] Additionally, this evaluation is biased towards algorithms that use the same cluster model. For example, k-means clustering naturally optimizes object distances, and a distance-based internal criterion will likely overrate the resulting clustering.\nTherefore, the internal evaluation measures are best suited to get some insight into situations where one algorithm performs better than another, but this shall not imply that one algorithm produces more valid results than another.[5] Validity as measured by such an index depends on the claim that this kind of structure exists in the data set. An algorithm designed for some kind of models has no chance if the data set contains a radically different set of models, or if the evaluation measures a radically different criterion.[5] For example, k-means clustering can only find convex clusters, and many evaluation indexes assume convex clusters. On a data set with non-convex clusters neither the use of k-means, nor of an evaluation criterion that assumes convexity, is sound.\nMore than a dozen of internal evaluation measures exist, usually based on the intuition that items in the same cluster should be more similar than items in different clusters.[39]: 115–121 For example, the following methods can be used to assess the quality of clustering algorithms based on internal criterion:\nThe Davies–Bouldin index can be calculated by the following formula: where n is the number of clusters, is the centroid of cluster , is the average distance of all elements in cluster to centroid , and is the distance between centroids and . Since algorithms that produce clusters with low intra-cluster distances (high intra-cluster similarity) and high inter-cluster distances (low inter-cluster similarity) will have a low Davies–Bouldin index, the clustering algorithm that produces a collection of clusters with the smallest Davies–Bouldin index is considered the best algorithm based on this criterion.\nThe Dunn index aims to identify dense and well-separated clusters. It is defined as the ratio between the minimal inter-cluster distance to maximal intra-cluster distance. For each cluster partition, the Dunn index can be calculated by the following formula:[40]\nwhere d(i,j) represents the distance between clusters i and j, and d '(k) measures the intra-cluster distance of cluster k. The inter-cluster distance d(i,j) between two clusters may be any number of distance measures, such as the distance between the centroids of the clusters. Similarly, the intra-cluster distance d '(k) may be measured in a variety of ways, such as the maximal distance between any pair of elements in cluster k. Since internal criterion seek clusters with high intra-cluster similarity and low inter-cluster similarity, algorithms that produce clusters with high Dunn index are more desirable.\nThe silhouette coefficient contrasts the average distance to elements in the same cluster with the average distance to elements in other clusters. Objects with a high silhouette value are considered well clustered, objects with a low value may be outliers. This index works well with k-means clustering, and is also used to determine the optimal number of clusters.[41]\nExternal evaluation\n[edit]In external evaluation, clustering results are evaluated based on data that was not used for clustering, such as known class labels and external benchmarks. Such benchmarks consist of a set of pre-classified items, and these sets are often created by (expert) humans. Thus, the benchmark sets can be thought of as a gold standard for evaluation.[35] These types of evaluation methods measure how close the clustering is to the predetermined benchmark classes. However, it has recently been discussed whether this is adequate for real data, or only on synthetic data sets with a factual ground truth, since classes can contain internal structure, the attributes present may not allow separation of clusters or the classes may contain anomalies.[42] Additionally, from a knowledge discovery point of view, the reproduction of known knowledge may not necessarily be the intended result.[42] In the special scenario of constrained clustering, where meta information (such as class labels) is used already in the clustering process, the hold-out of information for evaluation purposes is non-trivial.[43]\nA number of measures are adapted from variants used to evaluate classification tasks. In place of counting the number of times a class was correctly assigned to a single data point (known as true positives), such pair counting metrics assess whether each pair of data points that is truly in the same cluster is predicted to be in the same cluster.[35]\nAs with internal evaluation, several external evaluation measures exist,[39]: 125–129 for example:\nPurity\n[edit]Purity is a measure of the extent to which clusters contain a single class.[38] Its calculation can be thought of as follows: For each cluster, count the number of data points from the most common class in said cluster. Now take the sum over all clusters and divide by the total number of data points. Formally, given some set of clusters and some set of classes , both partitioning data points, purity can be defined as:\nThis measure doesn't penalize having many clusters, and more clusters will make it easier to produce a high purity. A purity score of 1 is always possible by putting each data point in its own cluster. Also, purity doesn't work well for imbalanced data, where even poorly performing clustering algorithms will give a high purity value. For example, if a size 1000 dataset consists of two classes, one containing 999 points and the other containing 1 point, then every possible partition will have a purity of at least 99.9%.\nThe Rand index[44] computes how similar the clusters (returned by the clustering algorithm) are to the benchmark classifications. It can be computed using the following formula:\nwhere is the number of true positives, is the number of true negatives, is the number of false positives, and is the number of false negatives. The instances being counted here are the number of correct pairwise assignments. That is, is the number of pairs of points that are clustered together in the predicted partition and in the ground truth partition, is the number of pairs of points that are clustered together in the predicted partition but not in the ground truth partition etc. If the dataset is of size N, then . One issue with the Rand index is that false positives and false negatives are equally weighted. This may be an undesirable characteristic for some clustering applications. The F-measure addresses this concern,[citation needed] as does the chance-corrected adjusted Rand index.\nThe F-measure can be used to balance the contribution of false negatives by weighting recall through a parameter . Let precision and recall (both external evaluation measures in themselves) be defined as follows: where is the precision rate and is the recall rate. We can calculate the F-measure by using the following formula:[38] When , . In other words, recall has no impact on the F-measure when , and increasing allocates an increasing amount of weight to recall in the final F-measure. Also is not taken into account and can vary from 0 upward without bound.\nThe Jaccard index is used to quantify the similarity between two datasets. The Jaccard index takes on a value between 0 and 1. An index of 1 means that the two dataset are identical, and an index of 0 indicates that the datasets have no common elements. The Jaccard index is defined by the following formula: This is simply the number of unique elements common to both sets divided by the total number of unique elements in both sets. Note that is not taken into account.\nThe Dice symmetric measure doubles the weight on while still ignoring :\nThe Fowlkes–Mallows index[45] computes the similarity between the clusters returned by the clustering algorithm and the benchmark classifications. The higher the value of the Fowlkes–Mallows index the more similar the clusters and the benchmark classifications are. It can be computed using the following formula: where is the number of true positives, is the number of false positives, and is the number of false negatives. The index is the geometric mean of the precision and recall and , and is thus also known as the G-measure, while the F-measure is their harmonic mean.[46][47] Moreover, precision and recall are also known as Wallace's indices and .[48] Chance normalized versions of recall, precision and G-measure correspond to Informedness, Markedness and Matthews Correlation and relate strongly to Kappa.[49]\nChi Index\n[edit]The Chi index[50] is an external validation index that measure the clustering results by applying the chi-squared statistic. This index scores positively the fact that the labels are as sparse as possible across the clusters, i.e., that each cluster has as few different labels as possible. The higher the value of the Chi Index the greater the relationship between the resulting clusters and the label used.\nThe mututal information is an information theoretic measure of how much information is shared between a clustering and a ground-truth classification that can detect a non-linear similarity between two clusterings. Normalized mutual information is a family of corrected-for-chance variants of this that has a reduced bias for varying cluster numbers.[35]\nA confusion matrix can be used to quickly visualize the results of a classification (or clustering) algorithm. It shows how different a cluster is from the gold standard cluster.\nValidity Measure\n[edit]The validity measure (short v-measure) is a combined metric for homogeneity and completeness of the clusters[51]\nCluster tendency\n[edit]To measure cluster tendency is to measure to what degree clusters exist in the data to be clustered, and may be performed as an initial test, before attempting clustering. One way to do this is to compare the data against random data. On average, random data should not have clusters [verification needed].\n- There are multiple formulations of the Hopkins statistic.[52] A typical one is as follows.[53] Let be the set of data points in dimensional space. Consider a random sample (without replacement) of data points with members . Also generate a set of uniformly randomly distributed data points. Now define two distance measures, to be the distance of from its nearest neighbor in X and to be the distance of from its nearest neighbor in X. We then define the Hopkins statistic as:\n- With this definition, uniform random data should tend to have values near to 0.5, and clustered data should tend to have values nearer to 1.\n- However, data containing just a single Gaussian will also score close to 1, as this statistic measures deviation from a uniform distribution, not multimodality, making this statistic largely useless in application (as real data never is remotely uniform).\nApplications\n[edit]Biology, computational biology and bioinformatics\n[edit]- Plant and animal ecology\n- Cluster analysis is used to describe and to make spatial and temporal comparisons of communities (assemblages) of organisms in heterogeneous environments. It is also used in plant systematics to generate artificial phylogenies or clusters of organisms (individuals) at the species, genus or higher level that share a number of attributes.\n- Transcriptomics\n- Clustering is used to build groups of genes with related expression patterns (also known as coexpressed genes) as in HCS clustering algorithm.[54][55] Often such groups contain functionally related proteins, such as enzymes for a specific pathway, or genes that are co-regulated. High throughput experiments using expressed sequence tags (ESTs) or DNA microarrays can be a powerful tool for genome annotation – a general aspect of genomics.\n- Sequence analysis\n- Sequence clustering is used to group homologous sequences into gene families.[56] This is a very important concept in bioinformatics, and evolutionary biology in general. See evolution by gene duplication.\n- High-throughput genotyping platforms\n- Clustering algorithms are used to automatically assign genotypes.[57]\n- Human genetic clustering\n- The similarity of genetic data is used in clustering to infer population structures.\n- Medical imaging\n- On PET scans, cluster analysis can be used to differentiate between different types of tissue in a three-dimensional image for many different purposes.[58]\n- Analysis of antimicrobial activity\n- Cluster analysis can be used to analyse patterns of antibiotic resistance, to classify antimicrobial compounds according to their mechanism of action, to classify antibiotics according to their antibacterial activity.\n- IMRT segmentation\n- Clustering can be used to divide a fluence map into distinct regions for conversion into deliverable fields in MLC-based Radiation Therapy.\nBusiness and marketing\n[edit]- Market research\n- Cluster analysis is widely used in market research when working with multivariate data from surveys and test panels. Market researchers use cluster analysis to partition the general population of consumers into market segments and to better understand the relationships between different groups of consumers/potential customers, and for use in market segmentation, product positioning, new product development and selecting test markets.\n- Grouping of shopping items\n- Clustering can be used to group all the shopping items available on the web into a set of unique products. For example, all the items on eBay can be grouped into unique products (eBay does not have the concept of a SKU).\n- Social network analysis\n- In the study of social networks, clustering may be used to recognize communities within large groups of people.\n- Search result grouping\n- In the process of intelligent grouping of the files and websites, clustering may be used to create a more relevant set of search results compared to normal search engines like Google[citation needed]. There are currently a number of web-based clustering tools such as Clusty. It also may be used to return a more comprehensive set of results in cases where a search term could refer to vastly different things. Each distinct use of the term corresponds to a unique cluster of results, allowing a ranking algorithm to return comprehensive results by picking the top result from each cluster.[59]\n- Slippy map optimization\n- Flickr's map of photos and other map sites use clustering to reduce the number of markers on a map.[citation needed] This makes it both faster and reduces the amount of visual clutter.\n- Software evolution\n- Clustering is useful in software evolution as it helps to reduce legacy properties in code by reforming functionality that has become dispersed. It is a form of restructuring and hence is a way of direct preventative maintenance.\n- Image segmentation\n- Image segmentation is the process of dividing a digital image into multiple meaningful regions or segments to simplify and/or change the representation of an image, making it easier to analyze. These segments may correspond to different objects, parts of objects, or background areas. The goal is to assign a label to every pixel in the image so that the pixels with similar attributes are grouped together.\n- This process is used in fields like medical imaging, computer vision, satellite imaging, and in daily applications like face detection and photo editing.\n- Clustering in Image Segmentation:\n- Clustering plays a significant role in image segmentation. It groups pixels into clusters based on similarity without needing labeled data. These clusters then define segments within the image.\n- Here are the most commonly used clustering algorithms for image segmentation:\n- K-means Clustering: One of the most popular and straightforward methods. Pixels are treated as data points in a feature space (usually defined by color or intensity) and grouped into k clusters. Each pixel is assigned to the nearest cluster center, and the centers are updated iteratively.\n- Mean Shift Clustering: A non-parametric method that does not require specifying the number of clusters in advance. It identifies clusters by locating dense areas of data points in the feature space.\n- Fuzzy C-means: Unlike k-means, which assigns pixels to exactly one cluster, fuzzy c-means allows each pixel to belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of membership.\n- Evolutionary algorithms\n- Clustering may be used to identify different niches within the population of an evolutionary algorithm so that reproductive opportunity can be distributed more evenly amongst the evolving species or subspecies.\n- Recommender systems\n- Recommender systems suggest items, products, or other users to an individual based on their past behavior and current preferences. These systems will occasionally use clustering algorithms to predict a user's unknown preferences by analyzing the preferences and activities of other users within the same cluster. Cluster analysis is not the only approach for recommendation systems, for example there are systems that leverage graph theory. Recommendation algorithms that utilize cluster analysis often fall into one of the three main categories: Collaborative filtering, Content-Based filtering, and a hybrid of the collaborative and content-based.\n- Collaborative Filtering Recommendation Algorithm\n- Collaborative filtering works by analyzing large amounts of data on user behavior, preferences, and activities to predict what a user might like based on similarities with others. It detects patterns in how users rate items and groups similar users or items into distinct “neighborhoods.” Recommendations are then generated by leveraging the ratings of content from others within the same neighborhood. The algorithm can focus on either user-based or item-based grouping depending on the context.[60]\n- Content-Based Filtering Recommendation Algorithm\n- Content-based filtering uses item descriptions and a user's preference profile to recommend items with similar characteristics to those the user previously liked. It evaluates the distance between feature vectors of item clusters, or “neighborhoods.” The user's past interactions are represented as a weighted feature vector, which is compared to these clusters. Recommendations are generated by identifying the cluster evaluated be the closest in distance with the user's preferences.[60]\n- Hybrid Recommendation Algorithms\n- Hybrid recommendation algorithms combine collaborative and content-based filtering to better meet the requirements of specific use cases. In certain cases this approach leads to more effective recommendations. Common strategies include: (1) running collaborative and content-based filtering separately and combining the results, (2) adding onto one approach with specific features of the other, and (3) integrating both hybrid methods into one model.[60]\n- Markov chain Monte Carlo methods\n- Clustering is often utilized to locate and characterize extrema in the target distribution.\n- Anomaly detection\n- Anomalies/outliers are typically – be it explicitly or implicitly – defined with respect to clustering structure in data.\n- Natural language processing\n- Clustering can be used to resolve lexical ambiguity.[59]\n- DevOps\n- Clustering has been used to analyse the effectiveness of DevOps teams.[61]\nSocial science\n[edit]- Sequence analysis in social sciences\n- Cluster analysis is used to identify patterns of family life trajectories, professional careers, and daily or weekly time use for example.\n- Crime analysis\n- Cluster analysis can be used to identify areas where there are greater incidences of particular types of crime. By identifying these distinct areas or \"hot spots\" where a similar crime has happened over a period of time, it is possible to manage law enforcement resources more effectively.\n- Educational data mining\n- Cluster analysis is for example used to identify groups of schools or students with similar properties.\n- Typologies\n- From poll data, projects such as those undertaken by the Pew Research Center use cluster analysis to discern typologies of opinions, habits, and demographics that may be useful in politics and marketing.\nOthers\n[edit]- Field robotics\n- Clustering algorithms are used for robotic situational awareness to track objects and detect outliers in sensor data.[62]\n- Mathematical chemistry\n- To find structural similarity, etc., for example, 3000 chemical compounds were clustered in the space of 90 topological indices.[63]\n- Climatology\n- To find weather regimes or preferred sea level pressure atmospheric patterns.[64]\n- Finance\n- Cluster analysis has been used to cluster stocks into sectors.[65]\n- Petroleum geology\n- Cluster analysis is used to reconstruct missing bottom hole core data or missing log curves in order to evaluate reservoir properties.\n- Geochemistry\n- The clustering of chemical properties in different sample locations.\nSee also\n[edit]Specialized types of cluster analysis\n[edit]- Automatic clustering algorithms\n- Balanced clustering\n- Clustering high-dimensional data\n- Conceptual clustering\n- Consensus clustering\n- Constrained clustering\n- Community detection\n- Data stream clustering\n- HCS clustering\n- Sequence clustering\n- Spectral clustering\nTechniques used in cluster analysis\n[edit]- Artificial neural network (ANN)\n- Nearest neighbor search\n- Neighbourhood components analysis\n- Latent class analysis\n- Affinity propagation\nData projection and preprocessing\n[edit]Other\n[edit]- Cluster-weighted modeling\n- Curse of dimensionality\n- Determining the number of clusters in a data set\n- Parallel coordinates\n- Structured data analysis\n- Linear separability\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ Driver and Kroeber (1932). \"Quantitative Expression of Cultural Relationships\".

Have you ever wondered how Netflix groups similar movies together or how Amazon organizes its vast product catalog? These are real-world applications of clustering. This kind of data cannot be analyzed using supervised learning algorithms. When the goal is to group similar data points in a dataset, then we use cluster analysis. In this guide, we'll learn understand concept of clustering, its applications, and some popular clustering algorithms.What is Clustering?The task of grouping data points based on their similarity with each other is called Clustering or Cluster Analysis. This method is defined under the branch of unsupervised learning, which aims at gaining insights from unlabelled data points. Think of it as you have a dataset of customers shopping habits. Clustering can help you group customers with similar purchasing behaviors, which can then be used for targeted marketing, product recommendations, or customer segmentationFor Example, In the graph given below, we can clearly see that there are 3 circular clusters forming on the basis of distance.Now it is not necessary that the clusters formed must be circular in shape. The shape of clusters can be arbitrary. There are many algorithms that work well with detecting arbitrary shaped clusters. For example, In the below given graph we can see that the clusters formed are not circular in shape.Types of ClusteringBroadly speaking, there are 2 types of clustering that can be performed to group similar data points:Hard Clustering: In this type of clustering, each data point belongs to a cluster completely or not. For example, Let's say there are 4 data point and we have to cluster them into 2 clusters. So each data point will either belong to cluster 1 or cluster 2.Data PointsClustersAC1BC2CC2DC1Soft Clustering: In this type of clustering, instead of assigning each data point into a separate cluster, a probability or likelihood of that point being that cluster is evaluated. For example, Let's say there are 4 data point and we have to cluster them into 2 clusters. So we will be evaluating a probability of a data point belonging to both clusters. This probability is calculated for all data points.Data PointsProbability of C1Probability of C2A0.910.09B0.30.7C0.170.83D10Uses of ClusteringNow before we begin with types of clustering algorithms, we will go through the use cases of Clustering algorithms. Clustering algorithms are majorly used for:Market Segmentation: Businesses use clustering to group their customers and use targeted advertisements to attract more audience.Market Basket Analysis: Shop owners analyze their sales and figure out which items are majorly bought together by the customers. For example, In USA, according to a study diapers and beers were usually bought together by fathers.Social Network Analysis: Social media sites use your data to understand your browsing behavior and provide you with targeted friend recommendations or content recommendations.Medical Imaging: Doctors use Clustering to find out diseased areas in diagnostic images like X-rays.Anomaly Detection: To find outliers in a stream of real-time dataset or forecasting fraudulent transactions we can use clustering to identify them.Simplify working with large datasets: Each cluster is given a cluster ID after clustering is complete. Now, you may reduce a feature set's whole feature set into its cluster ID. Clustering is effective when it can represent a complicated case with a straightforward cluster ID. Using the same principle, clustering data can make complex datasets simpler.There are many more use cases for clustering but there are some of the major and common use cases of clustering. Moving forward we will be discussing Clustering Algorithms that will help you perform the above tasks.Types of Clustering MethodsAt the surface level, clustering helps in the analysis of unstructured data. Graphing, the shortest distance, and the density of the data points are a few of the elements that influence cluster formation. Clustering is the process of determining how related the objects are based on a metric called the similarity measure. Similarity metrics are easier to locate in smaller sets of features and harder as the number of features increases. Depending on the type of clustering algorithm being utilized, several techniques are employed to group the data from the datasets. In this part, the clustering techniques are described. Various types of clustering algorithms are:Centroid-based Clustering (Partitioning methods)Density-based Clustering (Model-based methods)Connectivity-based Clustering (Hierarchical clustering)We will be going through each of these types in brief.1. Centroid-based Clustering (Partitioning methods)Centroid-based clustering organizes data points around central vectors (centroids) that represent clusters. Each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest centroid. Generally, the similarity measure chosen for these algorithms are Euclidian distance, Manhattan Distance or Minkowski Distance. The datasets are separated into a predetermined number of clusters, and each cluster is referenced by a vector of values. When compared to the vector value, the input data variable shows no difference and joins the cluster. The major drawback for centroid-based algorithms is the requirement that we establish the number of clusters, \"k,\" either intuitively or scientifically (using the Elbow Method) before any clustering machine learning system starts allocating the data points. Despite this limitation, it remains the most popular type of clustering due to its simplicity and efficiency. Popular algorithms of Centroid-based clustering are:K-means and K-medoids clustering are some examples of this type clustering.2. Density-based Clustering (Model-based methods)Density-based clustering identifies clusters as areas of high density separated by regions of low density in the data space. Unlike centroid-based methods, density-based clustering automatically determines the number of clusters and is less susceptible to initialization positions. Key Characteristics:Can find arbitrarily shaped clustersHandles noise and outliers wellExcels with clusters of different sizes and shapesIdeal for datasets with irregularly shaped or overlapping clustersEffectively manages both dense and sparse data regionsFocus on local density allows detection of various cluster morphologiesThe most popular density-based clustering algorithm is DBSCAN and OPTICS (Ordering Points To Identify Clustering Structure). 3. Connectivity-based Clustering (Hierarchical clustering)Connectivity-based clustering builds a hierarchy of clusters using a measure of connectivity based on distance when organizing a collection of items based on their similarities. This method builds a dendrogram, a tree-like structure that visually represents the relationships between objects.At the base of the tree, each object starts as its own individual cluster. The algorithm then evaluates how similar the objects are to one another and begins merging the closest pairs of clusters into larger groups. This process continues iteratively, with clusters being combined step by step, until all objects are united into a single cluster at the top of the tree.There are 2 approaches for Hierarchical clustering:Divisive Clustering: It follows a top-down approach, here we consider all data points to be part one big cluster and then this cluster is divide into smaller groups.Agglomerative Clustering: It follows a bottom-up approach, here we consider all data points to be part of individual clusters and then these clusters are clubbed together to make one big cluster with all data points. For implementing and understand difference between both techniques , please refer to : Agglomerative clustering and Divisive clusteringTill now, we have understood traditional \"hard\" clustering methods, where each data point is assigned to exactly one cluster. These methods, like K-Means and hierarchical clustering, are powerful and widely used, but they have limitations when dealing with ambiguous or overlapping data. After learning all about hard clustering methods we can addresses these limitations with soft clustering that allows data points to belong to multiple clusters simultaneously, with varying degrees of membership. This approach is particularly useful when the boundaries between clusters are not clear-cut or when data points exhibit characteristics of more than one group.Two of the most popular soft clustering techniques are:4. Distribution-based ClusteringDistribution-based clustering is a technique that assumes data points are generated from a mixture of probability distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Poisson, etc.). The goal is to identify clusters by estimating the parameters of these distributions. In distribution-based clustering:Each cluster is represented by a probability distribution.Data points are assigned to clusters based on how likely they are to belong to each distribution.Unlike distance-based methods (e.g., K-Means), this approach can capture clusters of varying shapes, sizes, and densities.Many real-world datasets, such as sensor data, financial data, or biological measurements, naturally follow statistical distributions. The most popular distribution-based clustering algorithm is Gaussian Mixture Model.5. Fuzzy Clustering Fuzzy clustering allows data points to belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of membership. Each data point is assigned a membership value between 0 and 1 for every cluster.These membership values indicate the degree to which a data point belongs to a particular cluster.Please refer to fuzzy clustering methods for in-depth understanding.

          "content": "2.3. Clustering#\nClustering of\nunlabeled data can be performed with the module sklearn.cluster\n.\nEach clustering algorithm comes in two variants: a class, that implements\nthe fit\nmethod to learn the clusters on train data, and a function,\nthat, given train data, returns an array of integer labels corresponding\nto the different clusters. For the class, the labels over the training\ndata can be found in the labels_\nattribute.\n2.3.1. Overview of clustering methods#\nNon-flat geometry clustering is useful when the clusters have a specific shape, i.e. a non-flat manifold, and the standard euclidean distance is not the right metric. This case arises in the two top rows of the figure above.\nGaussian mixture models, useful for clustering, are described in another chapter of the documentation dedicated to mixture models. KMeans can be seen as a special case of Gaussian mixture model with equal covariance per component.\nTransductive clustering methods (in contrast to inductive clustering methods) are not designed to be applied to new, unseen data.\n2.3.2. K-means#\nThe KMeans\nalgorithm clusters data by trying to separate samples in n\ngroups of equal variance, minimizing a criterion known as the inertia or\nwithin-cluster sum-of-squares (see below). This algorithm requires the number\nof clusters to be specified. It scales well to large numbers of samples and has\nbeen used across a large range of application areas in many different fields.\nThe k-means algorithm divides a set of \\(N\\) samples \\(X\\) into \\(K\\) disjoint clusters \\(C\\), each described by the mean \\(\\mu_j\\) of the samples in the cluster. The means are commonly called the cluster “centroids”; note that they are not, in general, points from \\(X\\), although they live in the same space.\nThe K-means algorithm aims to choose centroids that minimise the inertia, or within-cluster sum-of-squares criterion:\nInertia can be recognized as a measure of how internally coherent clusters are. It suffers from various drawbacks:\nInertia makes the assumption that clusters are convex and isotropic, which is not always the case. It responds poorly to elongated clusters, or manifolds with irregular shapes.\nInertia is not a normalized metric: we just know that lower values are better and zero is optimal. But in very high-dimensional spaces, Euclidean distances tend to become inflated (this is an instance of the so-called “curse of dimensionality”). Running a dimensionality reduction algorithm such as Principal component analysis (PCA) prior to k-means clustering can alleviate this problem and speed up the computations.\nFor more detailed descriptions of the issues shown above and how to address them, refer to the examples Demonstration of k-means assumptions and Selecting the number of clusters with silhouette analysis on KMeans clustering.\nK-means is often referred to as Lloyd’s algorithm. In basic terms, the algorithm has three steps. The first step chooses the initial centroids, with the most basic method being to choose \\(k\\) samples from the dataset \\(X\\). After initialization, K-means consists of looping between the two other steps. The first step assigns each sample to its nearest centroid. The second step creates new centroids by taking the mean value of all of the samples assigned to each previous centroid. The difference between the old and the new centroids are computed and the algorithm repeats these last two steps until this value is less than a threshold. In other words, it repeats until the centroids do not move significantly.\nK-means is equivalent to the expectation-maximization algorithm with a small, all-equal, diagonal covariance matrix.\nThe algorithm can also be understood through the concept of Voronoi diagrams. First the Voronoi diagram of the points is calculated using the current centroids. Each segment in the Voronoi diagram becomes a separate cluster. Secondly, the centroids are updated to the mean of each segment. The algorithm then repeats this until a stopping criterion is fulfilled. Usually, the algorithm stops when the relative decrease in the objective function between iterations is less than the given tolerance value. This is not the case in this implementation: iteration stops when centroids move less than the tolerance.\nGiven enough time, K-means will always converge, however this may be to a local\nminimum. This is highly dependent on the initialization of the centroids.\nAs a result, the computation is often done several times, with different\ninitializations of the centroids. One method to help address this issue is the\nk-means++ initialization scheme, which has been implemented in scikit-learn\n(use the init='k-means++'\nparameter). This initializes the centroids to be\n(generally) distant from each other, leading to probably better results than\nrandom initialization, as shown in the reference. For detailed examples of\ncomparing different initialization schemes, refer to\nA demo of K-Means clustering on the handwritten digits data and\nEmpirical evaluation of the impact of k-means initialization.\nK-means++ can also be called independently to select seeds for other\nclustering algorithms, see sklearn.cluster.kmeans_plusplus\nfor details\nand example usage.\nThe algorithm supports sample weights, which can be given by a parameter\nsample_weight\n. This allows to assign more weight to some samples when\ncomputing cluster centers and values of inertia. For example, assigning a\nweight of 2 to a sample is equivalent to adding a duplicate of that sample\nto the dataset \\(X\\).\nExamples\nClustering text documents using k-means: Document clustering using\nKMeans\nandMiniBatchKMeans\nbased on sparse dataAn example of K-Means++ initialization: Using K-means++ to select seeds for other clustering algorithms.\n2.3.2.1.

Mini Batch K-Means#\nThe MiniBatchKMeans\nis a variant of the KMeans\nalgorithm\nwhich uses mini-batches to reduce the computation time, while still attempting\nto optimise the same objective function. Mini-batches are subsets of the input\ndata, randomly sampled in each training iteration. These mini-batches\ndrastically reduce the amount of computation required to converge to a local\nsolution. In contrast to other algorithms that reduce the convergence time of\nk-means, mini-batch k-means produces results that are generally only slightly\nworse than the standard algorithm.\nThe algorithm iterates between two major steps, similar to vanilla k-means. In the first step, \\(b\\) samples are drawn randomly from the dataset, to form a mini-batch. These are then assigned to the nearest centroid. In the second step, the centroids are updated. In contrast to k-means, this is done on a per-sample basis. For each sample in the mini-batch, the assigned centroid is updated by taking the streaming average of the sample and all previous samples assigned to that centroid. This has the effect of decreasing the rate of change for a centroid over time. These steps are performed until convergence or a predetermined number of iterations is reached.\nMiniBatchKMeans\nconverges faster than KMeans\n, but the quality\nof the results is reduced. In practice this difference in quality can be quite\nsmall, as shown in the example and cited reference.\nExamples\nComparison of the K-Means and MiniBatchKMeans clustering algorithms: Comparison of\nKMeans\nandMiniBatchKMeans\nClustering text documents using k-means: Document clustering using\nKMeans\nandMiniBatchKMeans\nbased on sparse data\nReferences#\n“Web Scale K-Means clustering” D. Sculley, Proceedings of the 19th international conference on World wide web (2010)\n2.3.3. Affinity Propagation#\nAffinityPropagation\ncreates clusters by sending messages between\npairs of samples until convergence. A dataset is then described using a small\nnumber of exemplars, which are identified as those most representative of other\nsamples. The messages sent between pairs represent the suitability for one\nsample to be the exemplar of the other, which is updated in response to the\nvalues from other pairs. This updating happens iteratively until convergence,\nat which point the final exemplars are chosen, and hence the final clustering\nis given.\nAffinity Propagation can be interesting as it chooses the number of clusters based on the data provided. For this purpose, the two important parameters are the preference, which controls how many exemplars are used, and the damping factor which damps the responsibility and availability messages to avoid numerical oscillations when updating these messages.\nThe main drawback of Affinity Propagation is its complexity. The algorithm has a time complexity of the order \\(O(N^2 T)\\), where \\(N\\) is the number of samples and \\(T\\) is the number of iterations until convergence. Further, the memory complexity is of the order \\(O(N^2)\\) if a dense similarity matrix is used, but reducible if a sparse similarity matrix is used. This makes Affinity Propagation most appropriate for small to medium sized datasets.\nAlgorithm description#\nThe messages sent between points belong to one of two categories. The first is the responsibility \\(r(i, k)\\), which is the accumulated evidence that sample \\(k\\) should be the exemplar for sample \\(i\\). The second is the availability \\(a(i, k)\\) which is the accumulated evidence that sample \\(i\\) should choose sample \\(k\\) to be its exemplar, and considers the values for all other samples that \\(k\\) should be an exemplar. In this way, exemplars are chosen by samples if they are (1) similar enough to many samples and (2) chosen by many samples to be representative of themselves.\nMore formally, the responsibility of a sample \\(k\\) to be the exemplar of sample \\(i\\) is given by:\nWhere \\(s(i, k)\\) is the similarity between samples \\(i\\) and \\(k\\). The availability of sample \\(k\\) to be the exemplar of sample \\(i\\) is given by:\nTo begin with, all values for \\(r\\) and \\(a\\) are set to zero, and the calculation of each iterates until convergence. As discussed above, in order to avoid numerical oscillations when updating the messages, the damping factor \\(\\lambda\\) is introduced to iteration process:\nwhere \\(t\\) indicates the iteration times.\nExamples\nDemo of affinity propagation clustering algorithm: Affinity Propagation on a synthetic 2D datasets with 3 classes\nVisualizing the stock market structure Affinity Propagation on financial time series to find groups of companies\n2.3.4. Mean Shift#\nMeanShift\nclustering aims to discover blobs in a smooth density of\nsamples. It is a centroid based algorithm, which works by updating candidates\nfor centroids to be the mean of the points within a given region. These\ncandidates are then filtered in a post-processing stage to eliminate\nnear-duplicates to form the final set of centroids.\nMathematical details#\nThe position of centroid candidates is iteratively adjusted using a technique called hill climbing, which finds local maxima of the estimated probability density. Given a candidate centroid \\(x\\) for iteration \\(t\\), the candidate is updated according to the following equation:\nWhere \\(m\\) is the mean shift vector that is computed for each centroid that points towards a region of the maximum increase in the density of points. To compute \\(m\\) we define \\(N(x)\\) as the neighborhood of samples within a given distance around \\(x\\). Then \\(m\\) is computed using the following equation, effectively updating a centroid to be the mean of the samples within its neighborhood:\nIn general, the equation for \\(m\\) depends on a kernel used for density estimation. The generic formula is:\nIn our implementation, \\(K(x)\\) is equal to 1 if \\(x\\) is small enough and is equal to 0 otherwise. Effectively \\(K(y - x)\\) indicates whether \\(y\\) is in the neighborhood of \\(x\\).\nThe algorithm automatically sets the number of clusters, instead of relying on a\nparameter bandwidth\n, which dictates the size of the region to search through.\nThis parameter can be set manually, but can be estimated using the provided\nestimate_bandwidth\nfunction, which is called if the bandwidth is not set.\nThe algorithm is not highly scalable, as it requires multiple nearest neighbor searches during the execution of the algorithm. The algorithm is guaranteed to converge, however the algorithm will stop iterating when the change in centroids is small.\nLabelling a new sample is performed by finding the nearest centroid for a given sample.\nExamples\nA demo of the mean-shift clustering algorithm: Mean Shift clustering on a synthetic 2D datasets with 3 classes.\nReferences#\n“Mean shift: A robust approach toward feature space analysis” D. Comaniciu and P. Meer, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (2002)\n2.3.5. Spectral clustering#\nSpectralClustering\nperforms a low-dimension embedding of the\naffinity matrix between samples, followed by clustering, e.g., by KMeans,\nof the components of the eigenvectors in the low dimensional space.\nIt is especially computationally efficient if the affinity matrix is sparse\nand the amg\nsolver is used for the eigenvalue problem (Note, the amg\nsolver\nrequires that the pyamg module is installed.)\nThe present version of SpectralClustering requires the number of clusters to be specified in advance. It works well for a small number of clusters, but is not advised for many clusters.\nFor two clusters, SpectralClustering solves a convex relaxation of the normalized cuts problem on the similarity graph: cutting the graph in two so that the weight of the edges cut is small compared to the weights of the edges inside each cluster. This criteria is especially interesting when working on images, where graph vertices are pixels, and weights of the edges of the similarity graph are computed using a function of a gradient of the image.\nWarning\nTransforming distance to well-behaved similarities\nNote that if the values of your similarity matrix are not well distributed, e.g. with negative values or with a distance matrix rather than a similarity, the spectral problem will be singular and the problem not solvable. In which case it is advised to apply a transformation to the entries of the matrix. For instance, in the case of a signed distance matrix, is common to apply a heat kernel:\nsimilarity = np.exp(-beta * distance / distance.std())\nSee the examples for such an application.\nExamples\nSpectral clustering for image segmentation: Segmenting objects from a noisy background using spectral clustering.\nSegmenting the picture of greek coins in regions: Spectral clustering to split the image of coins in regions.\n2.3.5.1. Different label assignment strategies#\nDifferent label assignment strategies can be used, corresponding to the\nassign_labels\nparameter of SpectralClustering\n.\n\"kmeans\"\nstrategy can match finer details, but can be unstable.\nIn particular, unless you control the random_state\n, it may not be\nreproducible from run-to-run, as it depends on random initialization.\nThe alternative \"discretize\"\nstrategy is 100% reproducible, but tends\nto create parcels of fairly even and geometrical shape.\nThe recently added \"cluster_qr\"\noption is a deterministic alternative that\ntends to create the visually best partitioning on the example application\nbelow.\nReferences#\n“Multiclass spectral clustering” Stella X.

Spectral Clustering Graphs#\nSpectral Clustering can also be used to partition graphs via their spectral\nembeddings. In this case, the affinity matrix is the adjacency matrix of the\ngraph, and SpectralClustering is initialized with affinity='precomputed'\n:\n>>> from sklearn.cluster import SpectralClustering\n>>> sc = SpectralClustering(3, affinity='precomputed', n_init=100,\n... assign_labels='discretize')\n>>> sc.fit_predict(adjacency_matrix)\nReferences#\n“A Tutorial on Spectral Clustering” Ulrike von Luxburg, 2007\n“Normalized cuts and image segmentation” Jianbo Shi, Jitendra Malik, 2000\n“A Random Walks View of Spectral Segmentation” Marina Meila, Jianbo Shi, 2001\n“On Spectral Clustering: Analysis and an algorithm” Andrew Y.

Hierarchical clustering#\nHierarchical clustering is a general family of clustering algorithms that build nested clusters by merging or splitting them successively. This hierarchy of clusters is represented as a tree (or dendrogram). The root of the tree is the unique cluster that gathers all the samples, the leaves being the clusters with only one sample. See the Wikipedia page for more details.\nThe AgglomerativeClustering\nobject performs a hierarchical clustering\nusing a bottom up approach: each observation starts in its own cluster, and\nclusters are successively merged together. The linkage criteria determines the\nmetric used for the merge strategy:\nWard minimizes the sum of squared differences within all clusters. It is a variance-minimizing approach and in this sense is similar to the k-means objective function but tackled with an agglomerative hierarchical approach.\nMaximum or complete linkage minimizes the maximum distance between observations of pairs of clusters.\nAverage linkage minimizes the average of the distances between all observations of pairs of clusters.\nSingle linkage minimizes the distance between the closest observations of pairs of clusters.\nAgglomerativeClustering\ncan also scale to large number of samples\nwhen it is used jointly with a connectivity matrix, but is computationally\nexpensive when no connectivity constraints are added between samples: it\nconsiders at each step all the possible merges.\n2.3.6.1. Different linkage type: Ward, complete, average, and single linkage#\nAgglomerativeClustering\nsupports Ward, single, average, and complete\nlinkage strategies.\nAgglomerative cluster has a “rich get richer” behavior that leads to uneven cluster sizes. In this regard, single linkage is the worst strategy, and Ward gives the most regular sizes. However, the affinity (or distance used in clustering) cannot be varied with Ward, thus for non Euclidean metrics, average linkage is a good alternative. Single linkage, while not robust to noisy data, can be computed very efficiently and can therefore be useful to provide hierarchical clustering of larger datasets. Single linkage can also perform well on non-globular data.\nExamples\nVarious Agglomerative Clustering on a 2D embedding of digits: exploration of the different linkage strategies in a real dataset.\nComparing different hierarchical linkage methods on toy datasets: exploration of the different linkage strategies in toy datasets.\n2.3.6.2. Visualization of cluster hierarchy#\nIt’s possible to visualize the tree representing the hierarchical merging of clusters as a dendrogram. Visual inspection can often be useful for understanding the structure of the data, though more so in the case of small sample sizes.\nExamples\n2.3.6.3. Adding connectivity constraints#\nAn interesting aspect of AgglomerativeClustering\nis that\nconnectivity constraints can be added to this algorithm (only adjacent\nclusters can be merged together), through a connectivity matrix that defines\nfor each sample the neighboring samples following a given structure of the\ndata. For instance, in the swiss-roll example below, the connectivity\nconstraints forbid the merging of points that are not adjacent on the swiss\nroll, and thus avoid forming clusters that extend across overlapping folds of\nthe roll.\nThese constraint are useful to impose a certain local structure, but they also make the algorithm faster, especially when the number of the samples is high.\nThe connectivity constraints are imposed via an connectivity matrix: a\nscipy sparse matrix that has elements only at the intersection of a row\nand a column with indices of the dataset that should be connected. This\nmatrix can be constructed from a-priori information: for instance, you\nmay wish to cluster web pages by only merging pages with a link pointing\nfrom one to another. It can also be learned from the data, for instance\nusing sklearn.neighbors.kneighbors_graph\nto restrict\nmerging to nearest neighbors as in this example, or\nusing sklearn.feature_extraction.image.grid_to_graph\nto\nenable only merging of neighboring pixels on an image, as in the\ncoin example.\nWarning\nConnectivity constraints with single, average and complete linkage\nConnectivity constraints and single, complete or average linkage can enhance\nthe ‘rich getting richer’ aspect of agglomerative clustering,\nparticularly so if they are built with\nsklearn.neighbors.kneighbors_graph\n. In the limit of a small\nnumber of clusters, they tend to give a few macroscopically occupied\nclusters and almost empty ones. (see the discussion in\nAgglomerative clustering with and without structure).\nSingle linkage is the most brittle linkage option with regard to this issue.\nExamples\nA demo of structured Ward hierarchical clustering on an image of coins: Ward clustering to split the image of coins in regions.\nHierarchical clustering: structured vs unstructured ward: Example of Ward algorithm on a swiss-roll, comparison of structured approaches versus unstructured approaches.\nFeature agglomeration vs. univariate selection: Example of dimensionality reduction with feature agglomeration based on Ward hierarchical clustering.\n2.3.6.4. Varying the metric#\nSingle, average and complete linkage can be used with a variety of distances (or affinities), in particular Euclidean distance (l2), Manhattan distance (or Cityblock, or l1), cosine distance, or any precomputed affinity matrix.\nl1 distance is often good for sparse features, or sparse noise: i.e. many of the features are zero, as in text mining using occurrences of rare words.\ncosine distance is interesting because it is invariant to global scalings of the signal.\nThe guidelines for choosing a metric is to use one that maximizes the distance between samples in different classes, and minimizes that within each class.\nExamples\n2.3.6.5. Bisecting K-Means#\nThe BisectingKMeans\nis an iterative variant of KMeans\n, using\ndivisive hierarchical clustering. Instead of creating all centroids at once, centroids\nare picked progressively based on a previous clustering: a cluster is split into two\nnew clusters repeatedly until the target number of clusters is reached.\nBisectingKMeans\nis more efficient than KMeans\nwhen the number of\nclusters is large since it only works on a subset of the data at each bisection\nwhile KMeans\nalways works on the entire dataset.\nAlthough BisectingKMeans\ncan’t benefit from the advantages of the \"k-means++\"\ninitialization by design, it will still produce comparable results than\nKMeans(init=\"k-means++\")\nin terms of inertia at cheaper computational costs, and will\nlikely produce better results than KMeans\nwith a random initialization.\nThis variant is more efficient to agglomerative clustering if the number of clusters is small compared to the number of data points.\nThis variant also does not produce empty clusters.\n- There exist two strategies for selecting the cluster to split:\nbisecting_strategy=\"largest_cluster\"\nselects the cluster having the most pointsbisecting_strategy=\"biggest_inertia\"\nselects the cluster with biggest inertia (cluster with biggest Sum of Squared Errors within)\nPicking by largest amount of data points in most cases produces result as accurate as picking by inertia and is faster (especially for larger amount of data points, where calculating error may be costly).\nPicking by largest amount of data points will also likely produce clusters of similar\nsizes while KMeans\nis known to produce clusters of different sizes.\nDifference between Bisecting K-Means and regular K-Means can be seen on example Bisecting K-Means and Regular K-Means Performance Comparison. While the regular K-Means algorithm tends to create non-related clusters, clusters from Bisecting K-Means are well ordered and create quite a visible hierarchy.\nReferences#\n“A Comparison of Document Clustering Techniques” Michael Steinbach, George Karypis and Vipin Kumar, Department of Computer Science and Egineering, University of Minnesota (June 2000)\n“Performance Analysis of K-Means and Bisecting K-Means Algorithms in Weblog Data” K.Abirami and Dr.P.Mayilvahanan, International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Engineering Research (IJETER) Volume 4, Issue 8, (August 2016)\n“Bisecting K-means Algorithm Based on K-valued Self-determining and Clustering Center Optimization” Jian Di, Xinyue Gou School of Control and Computer Engineering,North China Electric Power University, Baoding, Hebei, China (August 2017)\n2.3.7. DBSCAN#\nThe DBSCAN\nalgorithm views clusters as areas of high density\nseparated by areas of low density. Due to this rather generic view, clusters\nfound by DBSCAN can be any shape, as opposed to k-means which assumes that\nclusters are convex shaped. The central component to the DBSCAN is the concept\nof core samples, which are samples that are in areas of high density. A\ncluster is therefore a set of core samples, each close to each other\n(measured by some distance measure)\nand a set of non-core samples that are close to a core sample (but are not\nthemselves core samples). There are two parameters to the algorithm,\nmin_samples\nand eps\n,\nwhich define formally what we mean when we say dense.\nHigher min_samples\nor lower eps\nindicate higher density necessary to form a cluster.\nMore formally, we define a core sample as being a sample in the dataset such\nthat there exist min_samples\nother samples within a distance of\neps\n, which are defined as neighbors of the core sample. This tells\nus that the core sample is in a dense area of the vector space. A cluster\nis a set of core samples that can be built by recursively taking a core\nsample, finding all of its neighbors that are core samples, finding all of\ntheir neighbors that are core samples, and so on. A cluster also has a\nset of non-core samples, which are samples that are neighbors of a core sample\nin the cluster but are not themselves core samples. Intuitively, these samples\nare on the fringes of a cluster.\nAny core sample is part of a cluster, by definition. Any sample that is not a\ncore sample, and is at least eps\nin distance from any core sample, is\nconsidered an outlier by the algorithm.\nWhile the parameter min_samples\nprimarily controls how tolerant the\nalgorithm is towards noise (on noisy and large data sets it may be desirable\nto increase this parameter), the parameter eps\nis crucial to choose\nappropriately for the data set and distance function and usually cannot be\nleft at the default value. It controls the local neighborhood of the points.\nWhen chosen too small, most data will not be clustered at all (and labeled\nas -1\nfor “noise”). When chosen too large, it causes close clusters to\nbe merged into one cluster, and eventually the entire data set to be returned\nas a single cluster. Some heuristics for choosing this parameter have been\ndiscussed in the literature, for example based on a knee in the nearest neighbor\ndistances plot (as discussed in the references below).\nIn the figure below, the color indicates cluster membership, with large circles indicating core samples found by the algorithm. Smaller circles are non-core samples that are still part of a cluster. Moreover, the outliers are indicated by black points below.\nExamples\nImplementation#\nThe DBSCAN algorithm is deterministic, always generating the same clusters when\ngiven the same data in the same order. However, the results can differ when\ndata is provided in a different order. First, even though the core samples will\nalways be assigned to the same clusters, the labels of those clusters will\ndepend on the order in which those samples are encountered in the data. Second\nand more importantly, the clusters to which non-core samples are assigned can\ndiffer depending on the data order. This would happen when a non-core sample\nhas a distance lower than eps\nto two core samples in different clusters. By\nthe triangular inequality, those two core samples must be more distant than\neps\nfrom each other, or they would be in the same cluster. The non-core\nsample is assigned to whichever cluster is generated first in a pass through the\ndata, and so the results will depend on the data ordering.\nThe current implementation uses ball trees and kd-trees to determine the\nneighborhood of points, which avoids calculating the full distance matrix (as\nwas done in scikit-learn versions before 0.14). The possibility to use custom\nmetrics is retained; for details, see NearestNeighbors\n.\nMemory consumption for large sample sizes#\nThis implementation is by default not memory efficient because it constructs a full pairwise similarity matrix in the case where kd-trees or ball-trees cannot be used (e.g., with sparse matrices). This matrix will consume \\(n^2\\) floats. A couple of mechanisms for getting around this are:\nUse OPTICS clustering in conjunction with the\nextract_dbscan\nmethod. OPTICS clustering also calculates the full pairwise matrix, but only keeps one row in memory at a time (memory complexity n).A sparse radius neighborhood graph (where missing entries are presumed to be out of eps) can be precomputed in a memory-efficient way and dbscan can be run over this with\nmetric='precomputed'\n. Seesklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors.radius_neighbors_graph\n.The dataset can be compressed, either by removing exact duplicates if these occur in your data, or by using BIRCH. Then you only have a relatively small number of representatives for a large number of points. You can then provide a\nsample_weight\nwhen fitting DBSCAN.\nReferences#\nA Density-Based Algorithm for Discovering Clusters in Large Spatial Databases with Noise Ester, M., H. P. Kriegel, J.

HDBSCAN#\nThe HDBSCAN\nalgorithm can be seen as an extension of DBSCAN\nand OPTICS\n. Specifically, DBSCAN\nassumes that the clustering\ncriterion (i.e. density requirement) is globally homogeneous.\nIn other words, DBSCAN\nmay struggle to successfully capture clusters\nwith different densities.\nHDBSCAN\nalleviates this assumption and explores all possible density\nscales by building an alternative representation of the clustering problem.\nNote\nThis implementation is adapted from the original implementation of HDBSCAN, scikit-learn-contrib/hdbscan based on [LJ2017].\nExamples\n2.3.8.1. Mutual Reachability Graph#\nHDBSCAN first defines \\(d_c(x_p)\\), the core distance of a sample \\(x_p\\), as the\ndistance to its min_samples\nth-nearest neighbor, counting itself. For example,\nif min_samples=5\nand \\(x_*\\) is the 5th-nearest neighbor of \\(x_p\\)\nthen the core distance is:\nNext it defines \\(d_m(x_p, x_q)\\), the mutual reachability distance of two points \\(x_p, x_q\\), as:\nThese two notions allow us to construct the mutual reachability graph\n\\(G_{ms}\\) defined for a fixed choice of min_samples\nby associating each\nsample \\(x_p\\) with a vertex of the graph, and thus edges between points\n\\(x_p, x_q\\) are the mutual reachability distance \\(d_m(x_p, x_q)\\)\nbetween them. We may build subsets of this graph, denoted as\n\\(G_{ms,\\varepsilon}\\), by removing any edges with value greater than \\(\\varepsilon\\):\nfrom the original graph. Any points whose core distance is less than \\(\\varepsilon\\):\nare at this staged marked as noise. The remaining points are then clustered by\nfinding the connected components of this trimmed graph.\nNote\nTaking the connected components of a trimmed graph \\(G_{ms,\\varepsilon}\\) is\nequivalent to running DBSCAN* with min_samples\nand \\(\\varepsilon\\). DBSCAN* is a\nslightly modified version of DBSCAN mentioned in [CM2013].\n2.3.8.2. Hierarchical Clustering#\nHDBSCAN can be seen as an algorithm which performs DBSCAN* clustering across all values of \\(\\varepsilon\\). As mentioned prior, this is equivalent to finding the connected components of the mutual reachability graphs for all values of \\(\\varepsilon\\). To do this efficiently, HDBSCAN first extracts a minimum spanning tree (MST) from the fully -connected mutual reachability graph, then greedily cuts the edges with highest weight. An outline of the HDBSCAN algorithm is as follows:\nExtract the MST of \\(G_{ms}\\).\nExtend the MST by adding a “self edge” for each vertex, with weight equal to the core distance of the underlying sample.\nInitialize a single cluster and label for the MST.\nRemove the edge with the greatest weight from the MST (ties are removed simultaneously).\nAssign cluster labels to the connected components which contain the end points of the now-removed edge. If the component does not have at least one edge it is instead assigned a “null” label marking it as noise.\nRepeat 4-5 until there are no more connected components.\nHDBSCAN is therefore able to obtain all possible partitions achievable by\nDBSCAN* for a fixed choice of min_samples\nin a hierarchical fashion.\nIndeed, this allows HDBSCAN to perform clustering across multiple densities\nand as such it no longer needs \\(\\varepsilon\\) to be given as a hyperparameter. Instead\nit relies solely on the choice of min_samples\n, which tends to be a more robust\nhyperparameter.\nHDBSCAN can be smoothed with an additional hyperparameter min_cluster_size\nwhich specifies that during the hierarchical clustering, components with fewer\nthan minimum_cluster_size\nmany samples are considered noise. In practice, one\ncan set minimum_cluster_size = min_samples\nto couple the parameters and\nsimplify the hyperparameter space.\nReferences\nCampello, R.J.G.B., Moulavi, D., Sander, J. (2013).

OPTICS#\nThe OPTICS\nalgorithm shares many similarities with the DBSCAN\nalgorithm, and can be considered a generalization of DBSCAN that relaxes the\neps\nrequirement from a single value to a value range. The key difference\nbetween DBSCAN and OPTICS is that the OPTICS algorithm builds a reachability\ngraph, which assigns each sample both a reachability_\ndistance, and a spot\nwithin the cluster ordering_\nattribute; these two attributes are assigned\nwhen the model is fitted, and are used to determine cluster membership. If\nOPTICS is run with the default value of inf set for max_eps\n, then DBSCAN\nstyle cluster extraction can be performed repeatedly in linear time for any\ngiven eps\nvalue using the cluster_optics_dbscan\nmethod. Setting\nmax_eps\nto a lower value will result in shorter run times, and can be\nthought of as the maximum neighborhood radius from each point to find other\npotential reachable points.\nThe reachability distances generated by OPTICS allow for variable density\nextraction of clusters within a single data set. As shown in the above plot,\ncombining reachability distances and data set ordering_\nproduces a\nreachability plot, where point density is represented on the Y-axis, and\npoints are ordered such that nearby points are adjacent. ‘Cutting’ the\nreachability plot at a single value produces DBSCAN like results; all points\nabove the ‘cut’ are classified as noise, and each time that there is a break\nwhen reading from left to right signifies a new cluster. The default cluster\nextraction with OPTICS looks at the steep slopes within the graph to find\nclusters, and the user can define what counts as a steep slope using the\nparameter xi\n. There are also other possibilities for analysis on the graph\nitself, such as generating hierarchical representations of the data through\nreachability-plot dendrograms, and the hierarchy of clusters detected by the\nalgorithm can be accessed through the cluster_hierarchy_\nparameter. The\nplot above has been color-coded so that cluster colors in planar space match\nthe linear segment clusters of the reachability plot. Note that the blue and\nred clusters are adjacent in the reachability plot, and can be hierarchically\nrepresented as children of a larger parent cluster.\nExamples\nComparison with DBSCAN#\nThe results from OPTICS cluster_optics_dbscan\nmethod and DBSCAN are very\nsimilar, but not always identical; specifically, labeling of periphery and noise\npoints. This is in part because the first samples of each dense area processed\nby OPTICS have a large reachability value while being close to other points in\ntheir area, and will thus sometimes be marked as noise rather than periphery.\nThis affects adjacent points when they are considered as candidates for being\nmarked as either periphery or noise.\nNote that for any single value of eps\n, DBSCAN will tend to have a shorter\nrun time than OPTICS; however, for repeated runs at varying eps\nvalues, a\nsingle run of OPTICS may require less cumulative runtime than DBSCAN. It is also\nimportant to note that OPTICS’ output is close to DBSCAN’s only if eps\nand\nmax_eps\nare close.\nComputational Complexity#\nSpatial indexing trees are used to avoid calculating the full distance matrix,\nand allow for efficient memory usage on large sets of samples. Different\ndistance metrics can be supplied via the metric\nkeyword.\nFor large datasets, similar (but not identical) results can be obtained via\nHDBSCAN\n. The HDBSCAN implementation is multithreaded, and has better\nalgorithmic runtime complexity than OPTICS, at the cost of worse memory scaling.\nFor extremely large datasets that exhaust system memory using HDBSCAN, OPTICS\nwill maintain \\(n\\) (as opposed to \\(n^2\\)) memory scaling; however,\ntuning of the max_eps\nparameter will likely need to be used to give a\nsolution in a reasonable amount of wall time.\nReferences#\n“OPTICS: ordering points to identify the clustering structure.” Ankerst, Mihael, Markus M.

BIRCH#\nThe Birch\nbuilds a tree called the Clustering Feature Tree (CFT)\nfor the given data. The data is essentially lossy compressed to a set of\nClustering Feature nodes (CF Nodes). The CF Nodes have a number of\nsubclusters called Clustering Feature subclusters (CF Subclusters)\nand these CF Subclusters located in the non-terminal CF Nodes\ncan have CF Nodes as children.\nThe CF Subclusters hold the necessary information for clustering which prevents the need to hold the entire input data in memory. This information includes:\nNumber of samples in a subcluster.\nLinear Sum - An n-dimensional vector holding the sum of all samples\nSquared Sum - Sum of the squared L2 norm of all samples.\nCentroids - To avoid recalculation linear sum / n_samples.\nSquared norm of the centroids.\nThe BIRCH algorithm has two parameters, the threshold and the branching factor. The branching factor limits the number of subclusters in a node and the threshold limits the distance between the entering sample and the existing subclusters.\nThis algorithm can be viewed as an instance or data reduction method,\nsince it reduces the input data to a set of subclusters which are obtained directly\nfrom the leaves of the CFT. This reduced data can be further processed by feeding\nit into a global clusterer. This global clusterer can be set by n_clusters\n.\nIf n_clusters\nis set to None, the subclusters from the leaves are directly\nread off, otherwise a global clustering step labels these subclusters into global\nclusters (labels) and the samples are mapped to the global label of the nearest subcluster.\nAlgorithm description#\nA new sample is inserted into the root of the CF Tree which is a CF Node. It is then merged with the subcluster of the root, that has the smallest radius after merging, constrained by the threshold and branching factor conditions. If the subcluster has any child node, then this is done repeatedly till it reaches a leaf. After finding the nearest subcluster in the leaf, the properties of this subcluster and the parent subclusters are recursively updated.\nIf the radius of the subcluster obtained by merging the new sample and the nearest subcluster is greater than the square of the threshold and if the number of subclusters is greater than the branching factor, then a space is temporarily allocated to this new sample. The two farthest subclusters are taken and the subclusters are divided into two groups on the basis of the distance between these subclusters.\nIf this split node has a parent subcluster and there is room for a new subcluster, then the parent is split into two. If there is no room, then this node is again split into two and the process is continued recursively, till it reaches the root.\nBIRCH or MiniBatchKMeans?#\nBIRCH does not scale very well to high dimensional data. As a rule of thumb if\nn_features\nis greater than twenty, it is generally better to use MiniBatchKMeans.If the number of instances of data needs to be reduced, or if one wants a large number of subclusters either as a preprocessing step or otherwise, BIRCH is more useful than MiniBatchKMeans.\nHow to use partial_fit?#\nTo avoid the computation of global clustering, for every call of partial_fit\nthe user is advised:\nTo set\nn_clusters=None\ninitially.Train all data by multiple calls to partial_fit.\nSet\nn_clusters\nto a required value usingbrc.set_params(n_clusters=n_clusters)\n.Call\npartial_fit\nfinally with no arguments, i.e.brc.partial_fit()\nwhich performs the global clustering.\nReferences#\nTian Zhang, Raghu Ramakrishnan, Maron Livny BIRCH: An efficient data clustering method for large databases. https://www.cs.sfu.ca/CourseCentral/459/han/papers/zhang96.pdf\nRoberto Perdisci JBirch - Java implementation of BIRCH clustering algorithm https://code.google.com/archive/p/jbirch\n2.3.11. Clustering performance evaluation#\nEvaluating the performance of a clustering algorithm is not as trivial as counting the number of errors or the precision and recall of a supervised classification algorithm. In particular any evaluation metric should not take the absolute values of the cluster labels into account but rather if this clustering define separations of the data similar to some ground truth set of classes or satisfying some assumption such that members belong to the same class are more similar than members of different classes according to some similarity metric.\n2.3.11.1. Rand index#\nGiven the knowledge of the ground truth class assignments\nlabels_true\nand our clustering algorithm assignments of the same\nsamples labels_pred\n, the (adjusted or unadjusted) Rand index\nis a function that measures the similarity of the two assignments,\nignoring permutations:\n>>> from sklearn import metrics\n>>> labels_true = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n>>> labels_pred = [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n>>> metrics.rand_score(labels_true, labels_pred)\n0.66...\nThe Rand index does not ensure to obtain a value close to 0.0 for a random labelling. The adjusted Rand index corrects for chance and will give such a baseline.\n>>> metrics.adjusted_rand_score(labels_true, labels_pred)\n0.24...\nAs with all clustering metrics, one can permute 0 and 1 in the predicted labels, rename 2 to 3, and get the same score:\n>>> labels_pred = [1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3]\n>>> metrics.rand_score(labels_true, labels_pred)\n0.66...\n>>> metrics.adjusted_rand_score(labels_true, labels_pred)\n0.24...\nFurthermore, both rand_score\nadjusted_rand_score\nare\nsymmetric: swapping the argument does not change the scores. They can\nthus be used as consensus measures:\n>>> metrics.rand_score(labels_pred, labels_true)\n0.66...\n>>> metrics.adjusted_rand_score(labels_pred, labels_true)\n0.24...\nPerfect labeling is scored 1.0:\n>>> labels_pred = labels_true[:]\n>>> metrics.rand_score(labels_true, labels_pred)\n1.0\n>>> metrics.adjusted_rand_score(labels_true, labels_pred)\n1.0\nPoorly agreeing labels (e.g. independent labelings) have lower scores, and for the adjusted Rand index the score will be negative or close to zero. However, for the unadjusted Rand index the score, while lower, will not necessarily be close to zero.:\n>>> labels_true = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n>>> labels_pred = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6]\n>>> metrics.rand_score(labels_true, labels_pred)\n0.39...\n>>> metrics.adjusted_rand_score(labels_true, labels_pred)\n-0.07...\nExamples\nAdjustment for chance in clustering performance evaluation: Analysis of the impact of the dataset size on the value of clustering measures for random assignments.\nMathematical formulation#\nIf C is a ground truth class assignment and K the clustering, let us define \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as:\n\\(a\\), the number of pairs of elements that are in the same set in C and in the same set in K\n\\(b\\), the number of pairs of elements that are in different sets in C and in different sets in K\nThe unadjusted Rand index is then given by:\nwhere \\(C_2^{n_{samples}}\\) is the total number of possible pairs in the dataset. It does not matter if the calculation is performed on ordered pairs or unordered pairs as long as the calculation is performed consistently.\nHowever, the Rand index does not guarantee that random label assignments will get a value close to zero (esp. if the number of clusters is in the same order of magnitude as the number of samples).\nTo counter this effect we can discount the expected RI \\(E[\\text{RI}]\\) of random labelings by defining the adjusted Rand index as follows:\nReferences#\nComparing Partitions L.

Mutual Information based scores#\nGiven the knowledge of the ground truth class assignments labels_true\nand\nour clustering algorithm assignments of the same samples labels_pred\n, the\nMutual Information is a function that measures the agreement of the two\nassignments, ignoring permutations. Two different normalized versions of this\nmeasure are available, Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) and Adjusted\nMutual Information (AMI). NMI is often used in the literature, while AMI was\nproposed more recently and is normalized against chance:\n>>> from sklearn import metrics\n>>> labels_true = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n>>> labels_pred = [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n>>> metrics.adjusted_mutual_info_score(labels_true, labels_pred)\n0.22504...\nOne can permute 0 and 1 in the predicted labels, rename 2 to 3 and get the same score:\n>>> labels_pred = [1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3]\n>>> metrics.adjusted_mutual_info_score(labels_true, labels_pred)\n0.22504...\nAll, mutual_info_score\n, adjusted_mutual_info_score\nand\nnormalized_mutual_info_score\nare symmetric: swapping the argument does\nnot change the score.

This example also includes the Adjusted Rand Index.\nMathematical formulation#\nAssume two label assignments (of the same N objects), \\(U\\) and \\(V\\). Their entropy is the amount of uncertainty for a partition set, defined by:\nwhere \\(P(i) = |U_i| / N\\) is the probability that an object picked at random from \\(U\\) falls into class \\(U_i\\). Likewise for \\(V\\):\nWith \\(P'(j) = |V_j| / N\\). The mutual information (MI) between \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) is calculated by:\nwhere \\(P(i, j) = |U_i \\cap V_j| / N\\) is the probability that an object picked at random falls into both classes \\(U_i\\) and \\(V_j\\).\nIt also can be expressed in set cardinality formulation:\nThe normalized mutual information is defined as\nThis value of the mutual information and also the normalized variant is not adjusted for chance and will tend to increase as the number of different labels (clusters) increases, regardless of the actual amount of “mutual information” between the label assignments.\nThe expected value for the mutual information can be calculated using the following equation [VEB2009]. In this equation, \\(a_i = |U_i|\\) (the number of elements in \\(U_i\\)) and \\(b_j = |V_j|\\) (the number of elements in \\(V_j\\)).\nUsing the expected value, the adjusted mutual information can then be calculated using a similar form to that of the adjusted Rand index:\nFor normalized mutual information and adjusted mutual information, the\nnormalizing value is typically some generalized mean of the entropies of each\nclustering. Various generalized means exist, and no firm rules exist for\npreferring one over the others. The decision is largely a field-by-field basis;\nfor instance, in community detection, the arithmetic mean is most common. Each\nnormalizing method provides “qualitatively similar behaviours” [YAT2016]. In\nour implementation, this is controlled by the average_method\nparameter.\nVinh et al. (2010) named variants of NMI and AMI by their averaging method [VEB2010]. Their ‘sqrt’ and ‘sum’ averages are the geometric and arithmetic means; we use these more broadly common names.\nReferences\nStrehl, Alexander, and Joydeep Ghosh (2002). “Cluster ensembles - a knowledge reuse framework for combining multiple partitions”.

Homogeneity, completeness and V-measure#\nGiven the knowledge of the ground truth class assignments of the samples, it is possible to define some intuitive metric using conditional entropy analysis.\nIn particular Rosenberg and Hirschberg (2007) define the following two desirable objectives for any cluster assignment:\nhomogeneity: each cluster contains only members of a single class.\ncompleteness: all members of a given class are assigned to the same cluster.\nWe can turn those concept as scores homogeneity_score\nand\ncompleteness_score\n. Both are bounded below by 0.0 and above by\n1.0 (higher is better):\n>>> from sklearn import metrics\n>>> labels_true = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n>>> labels_pred = [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n>>> metrics.homogeneity_score(labels_true, labels_pred)\n0.66...\n>>> metrics.completeness_score(labels_true, labels_pred)\n0.42...\nTheir harmonic mean called V-measure is computed by\nv_measure_score\n:\n>>> metrics.v_measure_score(labels_true, labels_pred)\n0.51...\nThis function’s formula is as follows:\nbeta\ndefaults to a value of 1.0, but for using a value less than 1 for beta:\n>>> metrics.v_measure_score(labels_true, labels_pred, beta=0.6)\n0.54...\nmore weight will be attributed to homogeneity, and using a value greater than 1:\n>>> metrics.v_measure_score(labels_true, labels_pred, beta=1.8)\n0.48...\nmore weight will be attributed to completeness.\nThe V-measure is actually equivalent to the mutual information (NMI) discussed above, with the aggregation function being the arithmetic mean [B2011].\nHomogeneity, completeness and V-measure can be computed at once using\nhomogeneity_completeness_v_measure\nas follows:\n>>> metrics.homogeneity_completeness_v_measure(labels_true, labels_pred)\n(0.66..., 0.42..., 0.51...)\nThe following clustering assignment is slightly better, since it is homogeneous but not complete:\n>>> labels_pred = [0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2]\n>>> metrics.homogeneity_completeness_v_measure(labels_true, labels_pred)\n(1.0, 0.68..., 0.81...)\nNote\nv_measure_score\nis symmetric: it can be used to evaluate\nthe agreement of two independent assignments on the same dataset.\nThis is not the case for completeness_score\nand\nhomogeneity_score\n: both are bound by the relationship:\nhomogeneity_score(a, b) == completeness_score(b, a)\nExamples\nAdjustment for chance in clustering performance evaluation: Analysis of the impact of the dataset size on the value of clustering measures for random assignments.\nMathematical formulation#\nHomogeneity and completeness scores are formally given by:\nwhere \\(H(C|K)\\) is the conditional entropy of the classes given the cluster assignments and is given by:\nand \\(H(C)\\) is the entropy of the classes and is given by:\nwith \\(n\\) the total number of samples, \\(n_c\\) and \\(n_k\\) the number of samples respectively belonging to class \\(c\\) and cluster \\(k\\), and finally \\(n_{c,k}\\) the number of samples from class \\(c\\) assigned to cluster \\(k\\).\nThe conditional entropy of clusters given class \\(H(K|C)\\) and the entropy of clusters \\(H(K)\\) are defined in a symmetric manner.\nRosenberg and Hirschberg further define V-measure as the harmonic mean of homogeneity and completeness:\nReferences\nV-Measure: A conditional entropy-based external cluster evaluation measure Andrew Rosenberg and Julia Hirschberg, 2007\nIdentification and Characterization of Events in Social Media, Hila Becker, PhD Thesis.\n2.3.11.4.

          "content": "k-means clustering\nk-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster. This results in a partitioning of the data space into Voronoi cells. k-means clustering minimizes within-cluster variances (squared Euclidean distances), but not regular Euclidean distances, which would be the more difficult Weber problem: the mean optimizes squared errors, whereas only the geometric median minimizes Euclidean distances. For instance, better Euclidean solutions can be found using k-medians and k-medoids.\nThe problem is computationally difficult (NP-hard); however, efficient heuristic algorithms converge quickly to a local optimum. These are usually similar to the expectation–maximization algorithm for mixtures of Gaussian distributions via an iterative refinement approach employed by both k-means and Gaussian mixture modeling. They both use cluster centers to model the data; however, k-means clustering tends to find clusters of comparable spatial extent, while the Gaussian mixture model allows clusters to have different shapes.\nThe unsupervised k-means algorithm has a loose relationship to the k-nearest neighbor classifier, a popular supervised machine learning technique for classification that is often confused with k-means due to the name. Applying the 1-nearest neighbor classifier to the cluster centers obtained by k-means classifies new data into the existing clusters. This is known as nearest centroid classifier or Rocchio algorithm.\nDescription\n[edit]Given a set of observations (x1, x2, ..., xn), where each observation is a -dimensional real vector, k-means clustering aims to partition the n observations into k (≤ n) sets S = {S1, S2, ..., Sk} so as to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) (i.e. variance). Formally, the objective is to find: where μi is the mean (also called centroid) of points in , i.e. is the size of , and is the usual L2 norm . This is equivalent to minimizing the pairwise squared deviations of points in the same cluster: The equivalence can be deduced from identity . Since the total variance is constant, this is equivalent to maximizing the sum of squared deviations between points in different clusters (between-cluster sum of squares, BCSS).[1] This deterministic relationship is also related to the law of total variance in probability theory.\nHistory\n[edit]The term \"k-means\" was first used by James MacQueen in 1967,[2] though the idea goes back to Hugo Steinhaus in 1956.[3] The standard algorithm was first proposed by Stuart Lloyd of Bell Labs in 1957 as a technique for pulse-code modulation, although it was not published as a journal article until 1982.[4] In 1965, Edward W. Forgy published essentially the same method, which is why it is sometimes referred to as the Lloyd–Forgy algorithm.[5]\nAlgorithms\n[edit]Standard algorithm (naive k-means)\n[edit]The most common algorithm uses an iterative refinement technique. Due to its ubiquity, it is often called \"the k-means algorithm\"; it is also referred to as Lloyd's algorithm, particularly in the computer science community. It is sometimes also referred to as \"naïve k-means\", because there exist much faster alternatives.[6]\nGiven an initial set of k means m1(1), ..., mk(1) (see below), the algorithm proceeds by alternating between two steps:[7]\n- Assignment step: Assign each observation to the cluster with the nearest mean: that with the least squared Euclidean distance.[8] (Mathematically, this means partitioning the observations according to the Voronoi diagram generated by the means.) where each is assigned to exactly one , even if it could be assigned to two or more of them.\n- Update step: Recalculate means (centroids) for observations assigned to each cluster.\nThe objective function in k-means is the WCSS (within cluster sum of squares). After each iteration, the WCSS decreases and so we have a nonnegative monotonically decreasing sequence. This guarantees that the k-means always converges, but not necessarily to the global optimum.\nThe algorithm has converged when the assignments no longer change or equivalently, when the WCSS has become stable. The algorithm is not guaranteed to find the optimum.[9]\nThe algorithm is often presented as assigning objects to the nearest cluster by distance. Using a different distance function other than (squared) Euclidean distance may prevent the algorithm from converging. Various modifications of k-means such as spherical k-means and k-medoids have been proposed to allow using other distance measures.\n- Pseudocode\nThe below pseudocode outlines the implementation of the standard k-means clustering algorithm. Initialization of centroids, distance metric between points and centroids, and the calculation of new centroids are design choices and will vary with different implementations. In this example pseudocode, argmin is used to find the index of the minimum value.\ndef k_means_cluster(k, points):\n# Initialization: choose k centroids (Forgy, Random Partition, etc.)\ncentroids = [c1, c2, ..., ck]\n# Initialize clusters list\nclusters = [[] for _ in range(k)]\n# Loop until convergence\nconverged = false\nwhile not converged:\n# Clear previous clusters\nclusters = [[] for _ in range(k)]\n# Assign each point to the \"closest\" centroid\nfor point in points:\ndistances_to_each_centroid = [distance(point, centroid) for centroid in centroids]\ncluster_assignment = argmin(distances_to_each_centroid)\nclusters[cluster_assignment].append(point)\n# Calculate new centroids\n# (the standard implementation uses the mean of all points in a\n# cluster to determine the new centroid)\nnew_centroids = [calculate_centroid(cluster) for cluster in clusters]\nconverged = (new_centroids == centroids)\ncentroids = new_centroids\nif converged:\nreturn clusters\nInitialization methods\n[edit]Commonly used initialization methods are Forgy and Random Partition.[10] The Forgy method randomly chooses k observations from the dataset and uses these as the initial means. The Random Partition method first randomly assigns a cluster to each observation and then proceeds to the update step, thus computing the initial mean to be the centroid of the cluster's randomly assigned points. The Forgy method tends to spread the initial means out, while Random Partition places all of them close to the center of the data set. According to Hamerly et al.,[10] the Random Partition method is generally preferable for algorithms such as the k-harmonic means and fuzzy k-means. For expectation maximization and standard k-means algorithms, the Forgy method of initialization is preferable. A comprehensive study by Celebi et al.,[11] however, found that popular initialization methods such as Forgy, Random Partition, and Maximin often perform poorly, whereas Bradley and Fayyad's approach[12] performs \"consistently\" in \"the best group\" and k-means++ performs \"generally well\".\n-\n1. k initial \"means\" (in this case k=3) are randomly generated within the data domain (shown in color).\n-\n2. k clusters are created by associating every observation with the nearest mean. The partitions here represent the Voronoi diagram generated by the means.\n-\n3. The centroid of each of the k clusters becomes the new mean.\n-\n4. Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until convergence has been reached.\nThe algorithm does not guarantee convergence to the global optimum. The result may depend on the initial clusters. As the algorithm is usually fast, it is common to run it multiple times with different starting conditions. However, worst-case performance can be slow: in particular certain point sets, even in two dimensions, converge in exponential time, that is 2Ω(n).[13] These point sets do not seem to arise in practice: this is corroborated by the fact that the smoothed running time of k-means is polynomial.[14]\nThe \"assignment\" step is referred to as the \"expectation step\", while the \"update step\" is a maximization step, making this algorithm a variant of the generalized expectation–maximization algorithm.\nComplexity\n[edit]Finding the optimal solution to the k-means clustering problem for observations in d dimensions is:\n- NP-hard in general Euclidean space (of d dimensions) even for two clusters,[15][16]\n- NP-hard for a general number of clusters k even in the plane,[17]\n- if k and d (the dimension) are fixed, the problem can be exactly solved in time , where n is the number of entities to be clustered.[18]\nThus, a variety of heuristic algorithms such as Lloyd's algorithm given above are generally used.\nThe running time of Lloyd's algorithm (and most variants) is ,[9][19] where:\n- n is the number of d-dimensional vectors (to be clustered)\n- k the number of clusters\n- i the number of iterations needed until convergence.\nOn data that does have a clustering structure, the number of iterations until convergence is often small, and results only improve slightly after the first dozen iterations. Lloyd's algorithm is therefore often considered to be of \"linear\" complexity in practice, although it is in the worst case superpolynomial when performed until convergence.[20]\n- In the worst-case, Lloyd's algorithm needs iterations, so that the worst-case complexity of Lloyd's algorithm is superpolynomial.[20]\n- Lloyd's k-means algorithm has polynomial smoothed running time. It is shown that[14] for arbitrary set of n points in , if each point is independently perturbed by a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance , then the expected running time of k-means algorithm is bounded by , which is a polynomial in n, k, d and .\n- Better bounds are proven for simple cases. For example, it is shown that the running time of k-means algorithm is bounded by for n points in an integer lattice .[21]\nLloyd's algorithm is the standard approach for this problem. However, it spends a lot of processing time computing the distances between each of the k cluster centers and the n data points. Since points usually stay in the same clusters after a few iterations, much of this work is unnecessary, making the naïve implementation very inefficient. Some implementations use caching and the triangle inequality in order to create bounds and accelerate Lloyd's algorithm.[22][9][23][24][25][26]\nOptimal number of clusters\n[edit]Finding the optimal number of clusters (k) for k-means clustering is a crucial step to ensure that the clustering results are meaningful and useful.[27] Several techniques are available to determine a suitable number of clusters. Here are some of commonly used methods:\n- Elbow method (clustering): This method involves plotting the explained variation as a function of the number of clusters, and picking the elbow of the curve as the number of clusters to use.[28] However, the notion of an \"elbow\" is not well-defined and this is known to be unreliable.[29]\n- Silhouette (clustering): Silhouette analysis measures the quality of clustering and provides an insight into the separation distance between the resulting clusters.[30] A higher silhouette score indicates that the object is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters.\n- Gap statistic: The Gap Statistic compares the total within intra-cluster variation for different values of k with their expected values under null reference distribution of the data.[31] The optimal k is the value that yields the largest gap statistic.\n- Davies–Bouldin index: The Davies-Bouldin index is a measure of the how much separation there is between clusters.[32] Lower values of the Davies-Bouldin index indicate a model with better separation.\n- Calinski-Harabasz index: This Index evaluates clusters based on their compactness and separation. The index is calculated using the ratio of between-cluster variance to within-cluster variance, with higher values indicate better-defined clusters.[33]\n- Rand index: It calculates the proportion of agreement between the two clusters, considering both the pairs of elements that are correctly assigned to the same or different clusters.[34] Higher values indicate greater similarity and better clustering quality. To provide a more accurate measure, the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), introduced by Hubert and Arabie in 1985, corrects the Rand Index by adjusting for the expected similarity of all pairings due to chance.[35]\nVariations\n[edit]- Jenks natural breaks optimization: k-means applied to univariate data\n- k-medians clustering uses the median in each dimension instead of the mean, and this way minimizes norm (Taxicab geometry).\n- k-medoids (also: Partitioning Around Medoids, PAM) uses the medoid instead of the mean, and this way minimizes the sum of distances for arbitrary distance functions.\n- Fuzzy C-Means Clustering is a soft version of k-means, where each data point has a fuzzy degree of belonging to each cluster.\n- Gaussian mixture models trained with expectation–maximization algorithm (EM algorithm) maintains probabilistic assignments to clusters, instead of deterministic assignments, and multivariate Gaussian distributions instead of means.\n- k-means++ chooses initial centers in a way that gives a provable upper bound on the WCSS objective.\n- The filtering algorithm uses k-d trees to speed up each k-means step.[36]\n- Some methods attempt to speed up each k-means step using the triangle inequality.[23][24][25][37][26]\n- Escape local optima by swapping points between clusters.[9]\n- The Spherical k-means clustering algorithm is suitable for textual data.[38]\n- Hierarchical variants such as Bisecting k-means,[39] X-means clustering[40] and G-means clustering[41] repeatedly split clusters to build a hierarchy, and can also try to automatically determine the optimal number of clusters in a dataset.\n- Internal cluster evaluation measures such as cluster silhouette can be helpful at determining the number of clusters.\n- Minkowski weighted k-means automatically calculates cluster specific feature weights, supporting the intuitive idea that a feature may have different degrees of relevance at different features.[42] These weights can also be used to re-scale a given data set, increasing the likelihood of a cluster validity index to be optimized at the expected number of clusters.[43]\n- Mini-batch k-means: k-means variation using \"mini batch\" samples for data sets that do not fit into memory.[44]\n- Otsu's method\nHartigan–Wong method\n[edit]Hartigan and Wong's method[9] provides a variation of k-means algorithm which progresses towards a local minimum of the minimum sum-of-squares problem with different solution updates. The method is a local search that iteratively attempts to relocate a sample into a different cluster as long as this process improves the objective function. When no sample can be relocated into a different cluster with an improvement of the objective, the method stops (in a local minimum). In a similar way as the classical k-means, the approach remains a heuristic since it does not necessarily guarantee that the final solution is globally optimum.\nLet be the individual cost of defined by , with the center of the cluster.\n- Assignment step\n- Hartigan and Wong's method starts by partitioning the points into random clusters .\n- Update step\n- Next it determines the and for which the following function reaches a maximum For the that reach this maximum, moves from the cluster to the cluster .\n- Termination\n- The algorithm terminates once is less than zero for all .\nDifferent move acceptance strategies can be used. In a first-improvement strategy, any improving relocation can be applied, whereas in a best-improvement strategy, all possible relocations are iteratively tested and only the best is applied at each iteration. The former approach favors speed, whether the latter approach generally favors solution quality at the expense of additional computational time. The function used to calculate the result of a relocation can also be efficiently evaluated by using equality[45]\nGlobal optimization and meta-heuristics\n[edit]The classical k-means algorithm and its variations are known to only converge to local minima of the minimum-sum-of-squares clustering problem defined as Many studies have attempted to improve the convergence behavior of the algorithm and maximize the chances of attaining the global optimum (or at least, local minima of better quality). Initialization and restart techniques discussed in the previous sections are one alternative to find better solutions. More recently, global optimization algorithms based on branch-and-bound and semidefinite programming have produced ‘’provenly optimal’’ solutions for datasets with up to 4,177 entities and 20,531 features.[46] As expected, due to the NP-hardness of the subjacent optimization problem, the computational time of optimal algorithms for k-means quickly increases beyond this size. Optimal solutions for small- and medium-scale still remain valuable as a benchmark tool, to evaluate the quality of other heuristics. To find high-quality local minima within a controlled computational time but without optimality guarantees, other works have explored metaheuristics and other global optimization techniques, e.g., based on incremental approaches and convex optimization,[47] random swaps[48] (i.e., iterated local search), variable neighborhood search[49] and genetic algorithms.[50][51] It is indeed known that finding better local minima of the minimum sum-of-squares clustering problem can make the difference between failure and success to recover cluster structures in feature spaces of high dimension.[51]\nDiscussion\n[edit]Three key features of k-means that make it efficient are often regarded as its biggest drawbacks:\n- Euclidean distance is used as a metric and variance is used as a measure of cluster scatter.\n- The number of clusters k is an input parameter: an inappropriate choice of k may yield poor results. That is why, when performing k-means, it is important to run diagnostic checks for determining the number of clusters in the data set.\n- Convergence to a local minimum may produce counterintuitive (\"wrong\") results (see example in Fig.).\nA key limitation of k-means is its cluster model. The concept is based on spherical clusters that are separable so that the mean converges towards the cluster center. The clusters are expected to be of similar size, so that the assignment to the nearest cluster center is the correct assignment. When for example applying k-means with a value of onto the well-known Iris flower data set, the result often fails to separate the three Iris species contained in the data set. With , the two visible clusters (one containing two species) will be discovered, whereas with one of the two clusters will be split into two even parts. In fact, is more appropriate for this data set, despite the data set's containing 3 classes. As with any other clustering algorithm, the k-means result makes assumptions that the data satisfy certain criteria. It works well on some data sets, and fails on others.\nThe result of k-means can be seen as the Voronoi cells of the cluster means. Since data is split halfway between cluster means, this can lead to suboptimal splits as can be seen in the \"mouse\" example. The Gaussian models used by the expectation–maximization algorithm (arguably a generalization of k-means) are more flexible by having both variances and covariances. The EM result is thus able to accommodate clusters of variable size much better than k-means as well as correlated clusters (not in this example). In counterpart, EM requires the optimization of a larger number of free parameters and poses some methodological issues due to vanishing clusters or badly-conditioned covariance matrices. k-means is closely related to nonparametric Bayesian modeling.[53]\nApplications\n[edit]k-means clustering is rather easy to apply to even large data sets, particularly when using heuristics such as Lloyd's algorithm. It has been successfully used in market segmentation, computer vision, and astronomy among many other domains. It often is used as a preprocessing step for other algorithms, for example to find a starting configuration.\nVector quantization\n[edit]Vector quantization, a technique commonly used in signal processing and computer graphics, involves reducing the color palette of an image to a fixed number of colors, known as k. One popular method for achieving vector quantization is through k-means clustering. In this process, k-means is applied to the color space of an image to partition it into k clusters, with each cluster representing a distinct color in the image. This technique is particularly useful in image segmentation tasks, where it helps identify and group similar colors together.\nExample: In the field of computer graphics, k-means clustering is often employed for color quantization in image compression. By reducing the number of colors used to represent an image, file sizes can be significantly reduced without significant loss of visual quality. For instance, consider an image with millions of colors. By applying k-means clustering with k set to a smaller number, the image can be represented using a more limited color palette, resulting in a compressed version that consumes less storage space and bandwidth. Other uses of vector quantization include non-random sampling, as k-means can easily be used to choose k different but prototypical objects from a large data set for further analysis.\nCluster analysis\n[edit]Cluster analysis, a fundamental task in data mining and machine learning, involves grouping a set of data points into clusters based on their similarity. k-means clustering is a popular algorithm used for partitioning data into k clusters, where each cluster is represented by its centroid.\nHowever, the pure k-means algorithm is not very flexible, and as such is of limited use (except for when vector quantization as above is actually the desired use case). In particular, the parameter k is known to be hard to choose (as discussed above) when not given by external constraints. Another limitation is that it cannot be used with arbitrary distance functions or on non-numerical data. For these use cases, many other algorithms are superior.\nExample: In marketing, k-means clustering is frequently employed for market segmentation, where customers with similar characteristics or behaviors are grouped together. For instance, a retail company may use k-means clustering to segment its customer base into distinct groups based on factors such as purchasing behavior, demographics, and geographic location. These customer segments can then be targeted with tailored marketing strategies and product offerings to maximize sales and customer satisfaction.\nFeature learning\n[edit]k-means clustering has been used as a feature learning (or dictionary learning) step, in either (semi-)supervised learning or unsupervised learning.[54] The basic approach is first to train a k-means clustering representation, using the input training data (which need not be labelled). Then, to project any input datum into the new feature space, an \"encoding\" function, such as the thresholded matrix-product of the datum with the centroid locations, computes the distance from the datum to each centroid, or simply an indicator function for the nearest centroid,[54][55] or some smooth transformation of the distance.[56] Alternatively, transforming the sample-cluster distance through a Gaussian RBF, obtains the hidden layer of a radial basis function network.[57]\nThis use of k-means has been successfully combined with simple, linear classifiers for semi-supervised learning in NLP (specifically for named-entity recognition)[58] and in computer vision. On an object recognition task, it was found to exhibit comparable performance with more sophisticated feature learning approaches such as autoencoders and restricted Boltzmann machines.[56] However, it generally requires more data, for equivalent performance, because each data point only contributes to one \"feature\".[54]\nExample: In natural language processing (NLP), k-means clustering has been integrated with simple linear classifiers for semi-supervised learning tasks such as named-entity recognition (NER). By first clustering unlabeled text data using k-means, meaningful features can be extracted to improve the performance of NER models. For instance, k-means clustering can be applied to identify clusters of words or phrases that frequently co-occur in the input text, which can then be used as features for training the NER model. This approach has been shown to achieve comparable performance with more complex feature learning techniques such as autoencoders and restricted Boltzmann machines, albeit with a greater requirement for labeled data.\nRecent Developments\n[edit]Recent advancements in the application of k-means clustering include improvements in initialization techniques, such as the use of k-means++ initialization to select initial cluster centroids in a more effective manner. Additionally, researchers have explored the integration of k-means clustering with deep learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to enhance the performance of various tasks in computer vision, natural language processing, and other domains.\nRelation to other algorithms\n[edit]Gaussian mixture model\n[edit]The slow \"standard algorithm\" for k-means clustering, and its associated expectation–maximization algorithm, is a special case of a Gaussian mixture model, specifically, the limiting case when fixing all covariances to be diagonal, equal and have infinitesimal small variance.[59]: 850 Instead of small variances, a hard cluster assignment can also be used to show another equivalence of k-means clustering to a special case of \"hard\" Gaussian mixture modelling.[60]: 354, 11.4.2.5 This does not mean that it is efficient to use Gaussian mixture modelling to compute k-means, but just that there is a theoretical relationship, and that Gaussian mixture modelling can be interpreted as a generalization of k-means; on the contrary, it has been suggested to use k-means clustering to find starting points for Gaussian mixture modelling on difficult data.[59]: 849\nk-SVD\n[edit]Another generalization of the k-means algorithm is the k-SVD algorithm, which estimates data points as a sparse linear combination of \"codebook vectors\". k-means corresponds to the special case of using a single codebook vector, with a weight of 1.[61]\nPrincipal component analysis\n[edit]The relaxed solution of k-means clustering, specified by the cluster indicators, is given by principal component analysis (PCA).[62][63] The intuition is that k-means describe spherically shaped (ball-like) clusters. If the data has 2 clusters, the line connecting the two centroids is the best 1-dimensional projection direction, which is also the first PCA direction. Cutting the line at the center of mass separates the clusters (this is the continuous relaxation of the discrete cluster indicator). If the data have three clusters, the 2-dimensional plane spanned by three cluster centroids is the best 2-D projection. This plane is also defined by the first two PCA dimensions. Well-separated clusters are effectively modelled by ball-shaped clusters and thus discovered by k-means. Non-ball-shaped clusters are hard to separate when they are close. For example, two half-moon shaped clusters intertwined in space do not separate well when projected onto PCA subspace. k-means should not be expected to do well on this data.[64] It is straightforward to produce counterexamples to the statement that the cluster centroid subspace is spanned by the principal directions.[65]\nMean shift clustering\n[edit]Basic mean shift clustering algorithms maintain a set of data points the same size as the input data set. Initially, this set is copied from the input set. All points are then iteratively moved towards the mean of the points surrounding them. By contrast, k-means restricts the set of clusters to k clusters, usually much less than the number of points in the input data set, using the mean of all points in the prior cluster that are closer to that point than any other for the centroid (e.g. within the Voronoi partition of each updating point). A mean shift algorithm that is similar then to k-means, called likelihood mean shift, replaces the set of points undergoing replacement by the mean of all points in the input set that are within a given distance of the changing set.[66] An advantage of mean shift clustering over k-means is the detection of an arbitrary number of clusters in the data set, as there is not a parameter determining the number of clusters. Mean shift can be much slower than k-means, and still requires selection of a bandwidth parameter.\nIndependent component analysis\n[edit]Under sparsity assumptions and when input data is pre-processed with the whitening transformation, k-means produces the solution to the linear independent component analysis (ICA) task. This aids in explaining the successful application of k-means to feature learning.[67]\nBilateral filtering\n[edit]k-means implicitly assumes that the ordering of the input data set does not matter. The bilateral filter is similar to k-means and mean shift in that it maintains a set of data points that are iteratively replaced by means. However, the bilateral filter restricts the calculation of the (kernel weighted) mean to include only points that are close in the ordering of the input data.[66] This makes it applicable to problems such as image denoising, where the spatial arrangement of pixels in an image is of critical importance.\nSimilar problems\n[edit]The set of squared error minimizing cluster functions also includes the k-medoids algorithm, an approach which forces the center point of each cluster to be one of the actual points, i.e., it uses medoids in place of centroids.\nSoftware implementations\n[edit]Different implementations of the algorithm exhibit performance differences, with the fastest on a test data set finishing in 10 seconds, the slowest taking 25,988 seconds (~7 hours).[1] The differences can be attributed to implementation quality, language and compiler differences, different termination criteria and precision levels, and the use of indexes for acceleration.\nFree Software/Open Source\n[edit]The following implementations are available under Free/Open Source Software licenses, with publicly available source code.\n- Accord.NET contains C# implementations for k-means, k-means++ and k-modes.\n- ALGLIB contains parallelized C++ and C# implementations for k-means and k-means++.\n- AOSP contains a Java implementation for k-means.\n- CrimeStat implements two spatial k-means algorithms, one of which allows the user to define the starting locations.\n- ELKI contains k-means (with Lloyd and MacQueen iteration, along with different initializations such as k-means++ initialization) and various more advanced clustering algorithms.\n- Smile contains k-means and various more other algorithms and results visualization (for java, kotlin and scala).\n- Julia contains a k-means implementation in the JuliaStats Clustering package.\n- KNIME contains nodes for k-means and k-medoids.\n- Mahout contains a MapReduce based k-means.\n- mlpack contains a C++ implementation of k-means.\n- Octave contains k-means.\n- OpenCV contains a k-means implementation.\n- Orange includes a component for k-means clustering with automatic selection of k and cluster silhouette scoring.\n- PSPP contains k-means, The QUICK CLUSTER command performs k-means clustering on the dataset.\n- R contains three k-means variations.\n- SciPy and scikit-learn contain multiple k-means implementations.\n- Spark MLlib implements a distributed k-means algorithm.\n- Torch contains an unsup package that provides k-means clustering.\n- Weka contains k-means and x-means.\nProprietary\n[edit]The following implementations are available under proprietary license terms, and may not have publicly available source code.\n- Ayasdi\n- Mathematica\n- MATLAB\n- OriginPro\n- RapidMiner\n- SAP HANA\n- SAS\n- SPSS\n- Stata\nSee also\n[edit]- K-medoids\n- BFR algorithm\n- Centroidal Voronoi tessellation\n- Cluster analysis\n- DBSCAN\n- Head/tail breaks\n- k q-flats\n- k-means++\n- Linde–Buzo–Gray algorithm\n- Self-organizing map\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ a b Kriegel, Hans-Peter; Schubert, Erich; Zimek, Arthur (2016). \"The (black) art of runtime evaluation: Are we comparing algorithms or implementations?\".

          "content": "Hierarchical clustering\nIn data mining and statistics, hierarchical clustering (also called hierarchical cluster analysis or HCA) is a method of cluster analysis that seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters. Strategies for hierarchical clustering generally fall into two categories:\n- Agglomerative: Agglomerative: Agglomerative clustering, often referred to as a \"bottom-up\" approach, begins with each data point as an individual cluster. At each step, the algorithm merges the two most similar clusters based on a chosen distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance) and linkage criterion (e.g., single-linkage, complete-linkage)[1]. This process continues until all data points are combined into a single cluster or a stopping criterion is met. Agglomerative methods are more commonly used due to their simplicity and computational efficiency for small to medium-sized datasets [2].\n- Divisive: Divisive clustering, known as a \"top-down\" approach, starts with all data points in a single cluster and recursively splits the cluster into smaller ones. At each step, the algorithm selects a cluster and divides it into two or more subsets, often using a criterion such as maximizing the distance between resulting clusters. Divisive methods are less common but can be useful when the goal is to identify large, distinct clusters first.\nIn general, the merges and splits are determined in a greedy manner. The results of hierarchical clustering[3] are usually presented in a dendrogram.\nHierarchical clustering has the distinct advantage that any valid measure of distance can be used. In fact, the observations themselves are not required: all that is used is a matrix of distances. On the other hand, except for the special case of single-linkage distance, none of the algorithms (except exhaustive search in ) can be guaranteed to find the optimum solution.[citation needed]\nComplexity\n[edit]The standard algorithm for hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) has a time complexity of and requires memory, which makes it too slow for even medium data sets. However, for some special cases, optimal efficient agglomerative methods (of complexity ) are known: SLINK[4] for single-linkage and CLINK[5] for complete-linkage clustering. With a heap, the runtime of the general case can be reduced to , an improvement on the aforementioned bound of , at the cost of further increasing the memory requirements. In many cases, the memory overheads of this approach are too large to make it practically usable. Methods exist which use quadtrees that demonstrate total running time with space.[6]\nDivisive clustering with an exhaustive search is , but it is common to use faster heuristics to choose splits, such as k-means.\nCluster Linkage\n[edit]In order to decide which clusters should be combined (for agglomerative), or where a cluster should be split (for divisive), a measure of dissimilarity between sets of observations is required. In most methods of hierarchical clustering, this is achieved by use of an appropriate distance d, such as the Euclidean distance, between single observations of the data set, and a linkage criterion, which specifies the dissimilarity of sets as a function of the pairwise distances of observations in the sets. The choice of metric as well as linkage can have a major impact on the result of the clustering, where the lower level metric determines which objects are most similar, whereas the linkage criterion influences the shape of the clusters [7]. For example, complete-linkage tends to produce more spherical clusters than single-linkage.\nThe linkage criterion determines the distance between sets of observations as a function of the pairwise distances between observations.\nSome commonly used linkage criteria between two sets of observations A and B and a distance d are:[8][9]\nSome of these can only be recomputed recursively (WPGMA, WPGMC), for many a recursive computation with Lance-Williams-equations is more efficient, while for other (Hausdorff, Medoid) the distances have to be computed with the slower full formula. Other linkage criteria include:\n- The probability that candidate clusters spawn from the same distribution function (V-linkage).\n- The product of in-degree and out-degree on a k-nearest-neighbour graph (graph degree linkage).[17]\n- The increment of some cluster descriptor (i.e., a quantity defined for measuring the quality of a cluster) after merging two clusters.[18][19][20]\nAgglomerative clustering example\n[edit]For example, suppose this data is to be clustered, and the Euclidean distance is the distance metric.\nThe hierarchical clustering dendrogram would be:\nCutting the tree at a given height will give a partitioning clustering at a selected precision. In this example, cutting after the second row (from the top) of the dendrogram will yield clusters {a} {b c} {d e} {f}. Cutting after the third row will yield clusters {a} {b c} {d e f}, which is a coarser clustering, with a smaller number but larger clusters.\nThis method builds the hierarchy from the individual elements by progressively merging clusters. In our example, we have six elements {a} {b} {c} {d} {e} and {f}. The first step is to determine which elements to merge in a cluster. Usually, we want to take the two closest elements, according to the chosen distance.\nOptionally, one can also construct a distance matrix at this stage, where the number in the i-th row j-th column is the distance between the i-th and j-th elements. Then, as clustering progresses, rows and columns are merged as the clusters are merged and the distances updated. This is a common way to implement this type of clustering, and has the benefit of caching distances between clusters. A simple agglomerative clustering algorithm is described in the single-linkage clustering page; it can easily be adapted to different types of linkage (see below).\nSuppose we have merged the two closest elements b and c, we now have the following clusters {a}, {b, c}, {d}, {e} and {f}, and want to merge them further. To do that, we need to take the distance between {a} and {b c}, and therefore define the distance between two clusters. Usually the distance between two clusters and is one of the following:\n- The maximum distance between elements of each cluster (also called complete-linkage clustering):\n- The minimum distance between elements of each cluster (also called single-linkage clustering):\n- The mean distance between elements of each cluster (also called average linkage clustering, used e.g. in UPGMA):\n- The sum of all intra-cluster variance.\n- The increase in variance for the cluster being merged (Ward's method[11])\n- The probability that candidate clusters spawn from the same distribution function (V-linkage).\nIn case of tied minimum distances, a pair is randomly chosen, thus being able to generate several structurally different dendrograms. Alternatively, all tied pairs may be joined at the same time, generating a unique dendrogram.[21]\nOne can always decide to stop clustering when there is a sufficiently small number of clusters (number criterion). Some linkages may also guarantee that agglomeration occurs at a greater distance between clusters than the previous agglomeration, and then one can stop clustering when the clusters are too far apart to be merged (distance criterion). However, this is not the case of, e.g., the centroid linkage where the so-called reversals[22] (inversions, departures from ultrametricity) may occur.\nDivisive clustering\n[edit]The basic principle of divisive clustering was published as the DIANA (DIvisive ANAlysis clustering) algorithm.[23] Initially, all data is in the same cluster, and the largest cluster is split until every object is separate. Because there exist ways of splitting each cluster, heuristics are needed. DIANA chooses the object with the maximum average dissimilarity and then moves all objects to this cluster that are more similar to the new cluster than to the remainder.\nInformally, DIANA is not so much a process of \"dividing\" as it is of \"hollowing out\": each iteration, an existing cluster (e.g. the initial cluster of the entire dataset) is chosen to form a new cluster inside of it. Objects progressively move to this nested cluster, and hollow out the existing cluster. Eventually, all that's left inside a cluster is nested clusters that grew there, without it owning any loose objects by itself.\nFormally, DIANA operates in the following steps:\n- Let be the set of all object indices and the set of all formed clusters so far.\n- Iterate the following until :\n- Find the current cluster with 2 or more objects that has the largest diameter:\n- Find the object in this cluster with the most dissimilarity to the rest of the cluster:\n- Pop from its old cluster and put it into a new splinter group .\n- As long as isn't empty, keep migrating objects from to add them to . To choose which objects to migrate, don't just consider dissimilarity to , but also adjust for dissimilarity to the splinter group: let where we define , then either stop iterating when , or migrate .\n- Add to .\nIntuitively, above measures how strongly an object wants to leave its current cluster, but it is attenuated when the object wouldn't fit in the splinter group either. Such objects will likely start their own splinter group eventually.\nThe dendrogram of DIANA can be constructed by letting the splinter group be a child of the hollowed-out cluster each time. This constructs a tree with as its root and unique single-object clusters as its leaves.\nGreedy Nature of the Algorithm\n[edit]Hierarchical clustering is often described as a greedy algorithm because it makes a series of locally optimal choices without reconsidering previous steps. At each iteration, it merges the two clusters that are closest together based on a selected distance metric, always choosing the best immediate option available. This approach is \"greedy\" because it seeks to optimize the current decision rather than planning for the best possible overall clustering [1]. Once two clusters are merged, the decision is final and irreversible, without the possibility of backtracking, which can lead to suboptimal results if earlier choices were not ideal. Despite this, the greedy nature of hierarchical clustering makes it computationally efficient and simple to implement, though it may not always capture the true underlying structure of complex datasets [7].\nLimitations\n[edit]Hierarchical clustering, particularly in its standard agglomerative form, presents several notable limitations: (a) Time Complexity: Hierarchical clustering, especially in its basic agglomerative form, has a high time complexity of O(n³). This becomes a significant bottleneck for large datasets, limiting its scalability [24]. (b) Scalability: Due to the time and space complexity, hierarchical clustering algorithms struggle to handle very large datasets efficiently [6] (c) Sensitivity to Noise and Outliers: Hierarchical clustering methods can be sensitive to noise and outliers in the data, which can lead to the formation of inaccurate or misleading cluster hierarchies [25]. (d) Difficulty with High-Dimensional Data: In high-dimensional spaces, hierarchical clustering can face challenges due to the curse of dimensionality, where data points become sparse, and distance measures become less meaningful. This can result in poorly defined clusters[10][26]. (e) Inability to Handle Non-Convex Shapes and Varying Densities: Traditional hierarchical clustering methods, like many other clustering algorithms, often assume that clusters are convex and have similar densities. They may struggle to accurately identify clusters with non-convex shapes or varying densities [7].\nSoftware\n[edit]Open source implementations\n[edit]- ALGLIB implements several hierarchical clustering algorithms (single-link, complete-link, Ward) in C++ and C# with O(n²) memory and O(n³) run time.\n- ELKI includes multiple hierarchical clustering algorithms, various linkage strategies and also includes the efficient SLINK,[4] CLINK[5] and Anderberg algorithms, flexible cluster extraction from dendrograms and various other cluster analysis algorithms.\n- Julia has an implementation inside the Clustering.jl package.[27]\n- Octave, the GNU analog to MATLAB implements hierarchical clustering in function \"linkage\".\n- Orange, a data mining software suite, includes hierarchical clustering with interactive dendrogram visualisation.\n- R has built-in functions[28] and packages that provide functions for hierarchical clustering.[29][30][31]\n- SciPy implements hierarchical clustering in Python, including the efficient SLINK algorithm.\n- scikit-learn also implements hierarchical clustering in Python.\n- Weka includes hierarchical cluster analysis.\nCommercial implementations\n[edit]- MATLAB includes hierarchical cluster analysis.\n- SAS includes hierarchical cluster analysis in PROC CLUSTER.\n- Mathematica includes a Hierarchical Clustering Package.\n- NCSS includes hierarchical cluster analysis.\n- SPSS includes hierarchical cluster analysis.\n- Qlucore Omics Explorer includes hierarchical cluster analysis.\n- Stata includes hierarchical cluster analysis.\n- CrimeStat includes a nearest neighbor hierarchical cluster algorithm with a graphical output for a Geographic Information System.\nSee also\n[edit]- Binary space partitioning\n- Bounding volume hierarchy\n- Brown clustering\n- Cladistics\n- Cluster analysis\n- Computational phylogenetics\n- CURE data clustering algorithm\n- Dasgupta's objective\n- Dendrogram\n- Determining the number of clusters in a data set\n- Hierarchical clustering of networks\n- Locality-sensitive hashing\n- Nearest neighbor search\n- Nearest-neighbor chain algorithm\n- Numerical taxonomy\n- OPTICS algorithm\n- Statistical distance\n- Persistent homology\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ a b Murtagh, Fionn; Contreras, Pedro (2012). \"Algorithms for hierarchical clustering: an overview\".

          "content": "Automatic clustering algorithms\nAutomatic clustering algorithms are algorithms that can perform clustering without prior knowledge of data sets. In contrast with other cluster analysis techniques, automatic clustering algorithms can determine the optimal number of clusters even in the presence of noise and outlier points.[1][needs context]\nCentroid-based\n[edit]Given a set of n objects, centroid-based algorithms create k partitions based on a dissimilarity function, such that k≤n. A major problem in applying this type of algorithm is determining the appropriate number of clusters for unlabeled data. Therefore, most research in clustering analysis has been focused on the automation of the process.\nAutomated selection of k in a K-means clustering algorithm, one of the most used centroid-based clustering algorithms, is still a major problem in machine learning. The most accepted solution to this problem is the elbow method. It consists of running k-means clustering to the data set with a range of values, calculating the sum of squared errors for each, and plotting them in a line chart. If the chart looks like an arm, the best value of k will be on the \"elbow\".[2]\nAnother method that modifies the k-means algorithm for automatically choosing the optimal number of clusters is the G-means algorithm. It was developed from the hypothesis that a subset of the data follows a Gaussian distribution. Thus, k is increased until each k-means center's data is Gaussian. This algorithm only requires the standard statistical significance level as a parameter and does not set limits for the covariance of the data.[3]\nConnectivity-based (hierarchical clustering)\n[edit]Connectivity-based clustering or hierarchical clustering is based on the idea that objects have more similarities to other nearby objects than to those further away. Therefore, the generated clusters from this type of algorithm will be the result of the distance between the analyzed objects.\nHierarchical models can either be divisive, where partitions are built from the entire data set available, or agglomerating, where each partition begins with a single object and additional objects are added to the set.[4] Although hierarchical clustering has the advantage of allowing any valid metric to be used as the defined distance, it is sensitive to noise and fluctuations in the data set and is more difficult to automate.\nMethods have been developed to improve and automate existing hierarchical clustering algorithms[5] such as an automated version of single linkage hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). This computerized method bases its success on a self-consistent outlier reduction approach followed by the building of a descriptive function which permits defining natural clusters. Discarded objects can also be assigned to these clusters. Essentially, one needs not to resort to external parameters to identify natural clusters. Information gathered from HCA, automated and reliable, can be resumed in a dendrogram with the number of natural clusters and the corresponding separation, an option not found in classical HCA. This method includes the two following steps: outliers being removed (this is applied in many filtering applications) and an optional classification allowing expanding clusters with the whole set of objects.[6]\nBIRCH (balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchies) is an algorithm used to perform connectivity-based clustering for large data-sets.[7] It is regarded as one of the fastest clustering algorithms, but it is limited because it requires the number of clusters as an input. Therefore, new algorithms based on BIRCH have been developed in which there is no need to provide the cluster count from the beginning, but that preserves the quality and speed of the clusters. The main modification is to remove the final step of BIRCH, where the user had to input the cluster count, and to improve the rest of the algorithm, referred to as tree-BIRCH, by optimizing a threshold parameter from the data. In this resulting algorithm, the threshold parameter is calculated from the maximum cluster radius and the minimum distance between clusters, which are often known. This method proved to be efficient for data sets of tens of thousands of clusters. If going beyond that amount, a supercluster splitting problem is introduced. For this, other algorithms have been developed, like MDB-BIRCH, which reduces super cluster splitting with relatively high speed.[8]\nDensity-based\n[edit]Unlike partitioning and hierarchical methods, density-based clustering algorithms are able to find clusters of any arbitrary shape, not only spheres.\nThe density-based clustering algorithm uses autonomous machine learning that identifies patterns regarding geographical location and distance to a particular number of neighbors. It is considered autonomous because a priori knowledge on what is a cluster is not required.[9] This type of algorithm provides different methods to find clusters in the data. The fastest method is DBSCAN, which uses a defined distance to differentiate between dense groups of information and sparser noise. Moreover, HDBSCAN can self-adjust by using a range of distances instead of a specified one. Lastly, the method OPTICS creates a reachability plot based on the distance from neighboring features to separate noise from clusters of varying density.\nThese methods still require the user to provide the cluster center and cannot be considered automatic. The Automatic Local Density Clustering Algorithm (ALDC) is an example of the new research focused on developing automatic density-based clustering. ALDC works out local density and distance deviation of every point, thus expanding the difference between the potential cluster center and other points. This expansion allows the machine to work automatically. The machine identifies cluster centers and assigns the points that are left by their closest neighbor of higher density. [10]\nIn the automation of data density to identify clusters, research has also been focused on artificially generating the algorithms. For instance, the Estimation of Distribution Algorithms guarantees the generation of valid algorithms by the directed acyclic graph (DAG), in which nodes represent procedures (building block) and edges represent possible execution sequences between two nodes. Building Blocks determine the EDA's alphabet or, in other words, any generated algorithm. Clustering algorithms artificially generated are compared to DBSCAN, a manual algorithm, in experimental results.[11]\nAutoML for Clustering\n[edit]Recent advancements in automated machine learning (AutoML) have extended to the domain of clustering, where systems are designed to automatically select preprocessing techniques, feature transformations, clustering algorithms, and validation strategies without human intervention. Unlike traditional clustering methods that rely on fixed pipelines and manual tuning, AutoML-based clustering frameworks dynamically search for the best-performing configurations based on internal clustering validation indices (CVIs) or other unsupervised metrics.\nAn implementation in this area is TPOT-Clustering[12], an extension of the Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT), which automates the process of building clustering pipelines using genetic programming. TPOT-Clustering explores combinations of data transformations, dimensionality reduction methods, clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, DBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering), and scoring functions to optimize clustering performance. It leverages an evolutionary algorithm to search the space of possible pipelines, using internal scores such as silhouette or Davies–Bouldin index to guide the selection process.\nAutoML for clustering is particularly useful in domains where the structure of the data is unknown and manual tuning is infeasible due to the high dimensionality or complexity of the feature space. These approaches are gaining popularity in areas such as image segmentation, customer segmentation, and bioinformatics, where unsupervised insights are critical.\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ Outlier\n- ^ \"Using the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters for k-means clustering\". bl.ocks.org.

In short bursts, stress can be positive, such as when it helps you avoid danger or meet a deadline. But when stress lasts for a long time, it may harm your health.\nConsiderations\nStress is a normal feeling. There are two main types of stress:\n- Acute stress. This is short-term stress that goes away quickly. You feel it when you slam on the brakes, have a fight with your partner, or ski down a steep slope. It helps you manage dangerous situations. It also occurs when you do something new or exciting. All people have acute stress at one time or another.\n- Chronic stress. This is stress that lasts for a longer period of time. You may have chronic stress if you have money problems, an unhappy marriage, trouble at work, or significant health concerns. Any type of stress that goes on for weeks or months is chronic stress. You can become so used to chronic stress that you don't realize it is a problem. If you don't find ways to manage stress, it may lead to health problems.\nSTRESS AND YOUR BODY\nYour body reacts to stress by releasing hormones. These hormones make your brain more alert, cause your muscles to tense, and increase your pulse. In the short term, these reactions are good because they can help you handle the situation causing stress. This is your body's way of protecting itself.\nWhen you have chronic stress, your body stays alert, even though there is no danger. Over time, this puts you at risk for health problems, including:\n- High blood pressure\n- Heart disease\n- Diabetes\n- Obesity\n- Depression or anxiety\n- Skin problems, such as acne or eczema\n- Menstrual problems\nIf you already have a health condition, chronic stress can make it worse.\nSIGNS OF TOO MUCH STRESS\nStress can cause many types of physical and emotional symptoms. Sometimes, you may not realize these symptoms are caused by stress. Here are some signs that stress may be affecting you:\nCauses\nThe causes of stress are different for each person. You can have stress from good challenges as well as bad ones. Some common sources of stress include:\n- Getting married or divorced\n- Starting a new job\n- The death of a spouse or close family member\n- Getting laid off\n- Retiring\n- Having a baby\n- Money problems\n- Moving\n- Having a serious illness\n- Problems at work\n- Problems at home\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you feel overwhelmed by stress, or if it is affecting your health. Also contact your provider if you notice new or unusual symptoms.\nReasons you may want to seek help are:\n- You have feelings of panic, such as dizziness, rapid breathing, or a racing heartbeat.\n- You are unable to work or function at home or at your job.\n- You have fears that you cannot control.\n- You are having memories of a traumatic event.\nYour provider may refer you to a mental health provider. You can talk to this professional about your feelings, what seems to make your stress better or worse, and why you think you are having this problem. You may also work on developing ways to reduce stress in your life.\nIf you or someone you know is thinking about suicide, call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org. You can also call 1-800-273-8255 (1-800-273-TALK). The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline provides free and confidential support 24/7, anytime day or night.\nYou can also call 911 or the local emergency number or go to the hospital emergency room. DO NOT delay.\nIf someone you know has attempted suicide, call 911 or the local emergency number right away. DO NOT leave the person alone, even after you have called for help.\nAlternative Names\nAnxiety; Feeling uptight; Stress; Tension; Jitters; Apprehension\nReferences\nAhmed SM, Hershberger PJ, Lemkau JP.

According to these authors, the essence of inducing stress is how a person appraises the situation and whether he or she has the physical and mental ability to cope with the problem.\n- (countable, phonetics, loosely) A suprasegmental feature of a language having additional attention raised to a sound, word or word group by means of of loudness, duration or pitch; phonological prominence.\n- Synonym: accent\n- Some people put the stress on the first syllable of “controversy”; others put it on the second.\n- (countable, phonetics, strictly) The suprasegmental feature of a language having additional attention raised to a sound by means of loudness and/or duration; phonological prominence phonetically achieved by means of dynamics as distinct from pitch.\n- Synonym: stress accent\n- Antonyms: pitch, pitch accent\n- 2020 July 9, Steve Rapaport, “Parallel syncretism in early Indo-European”, in Bridget Drinka, editor, Historical Linguistics 2017: Selected Papers from the 23rd International Conference on Historical Linguistics, San Antonio, Texas, 31 July – 4 August 2017, page 59: ,\n- The shift from pitch to stress appears to happen before the other obliques begin merging in the Proto-Italic, Proto-Germanic, Primitive Irish, and Middle Indo-Aryan. But further investigation into the timeline of sound changes […] shows that, at least in Germanic, the oblique and core noun stems sound quite unpredictably different in all these families by the time of the crucial accent shift from pitch to stress. […] once a language becomes stress-sensitive, there seems to be a strong tendency in early Indo-European languages to shift the stress to the first syllable.

Small amounts of stress may be beneficial, but more stress can increase the risk of strokes, heart attacks, and mental illnesses, such as depression[3] in humans.\nTypes\n[change | change source]There are different types of stress. Each type has different characteristics and symptoms.[4]\n- Acute: stress causes immediate harm in a short time span. An example of this type of stress is having to finish an assignment quickly or avoiding a car crash\n- Chronic: stress causes continued harm and frustration. An example of this type of stress is continued unhappiness with school. This type of stress wears organisms down\n- Traumatic: stress after a scary and dangerous event. This stress causes fear. An example of this is experiencing a war or hurricane. This can lead to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)\nStress response\n[change | change source]Organisms respond to stress differently.\n- Physical: changes happening in the body. An example is a fast heartbeat after giving a speech\n- Emotional: changes happening to an organism's emotions. An example is feeling worried or upset about an upcoming exam\n- Mental: changes happening in the mind. An example is feeling unfocused due to difficulties at work\nStress may also lead to adaptations, which allow certain organisms to better deal with the stressors. Stress happens every day, and is part of every living thing's life. Too much stress is bad and can cause health problems. Stress plays a part in some physical problems, like heart disease. Stress also plays a part in many mental illnesses, like anxiety, Acute Stress Disorder, and PTSD.[source?]\nAcute Stress Disorder and PTSD are mental illnesses that can happen when a person experiences something that is very terrifying, like a major accident or a war. Another type of stress disorder is a \"psychosomatic illness\" where a person has physical symptoms that are caused by an emotional stress, not by physical harm.[5]\nStress management\n[change | change source]There are different ways to deal with stress. One tip is to remove yourself from the stressor. For example if a school assignment is causing stress, taking a break from the assignment can be good. This break can include sleeping or engaging in hobbies. Physical activity and exercise reduce stress.[6]\nSocial support from friends and family can be helpful. Health care professionals can help when stress is bad and affects physical or mental health. Relaxing with meditation and deep breathing can also manage stress.[source?]\nReferences\n[change | change source]- ↑ Greenberg, Neil; Carr, James A.; Summers, Cliff H.

          "content": "Chronic stress\nChronic stress is the physiological or psychological response induced by a long-term internal or external stressor.[1] The stressor, either physically present or recollected, will produce the same effect and trigger a chronic stress response.[1] There is a wide range of chronic stressors, but most entail relatively prolonged problems, conflicts and threats that people encounter on a daily basis.[2] Several chronic stressors have been identified as associated with disease and mortality including \"neighbourhood environment, financial strain, interpersonal stress, work stress and caregiving.\"[3]\nStress responses, such as the fight or flight response, are fundamental. The complexity of the environment means that it is constantly changing. To navigate the surroundings, we, therefore, need a system that is capable of responding to perceived threatening and harmful situations.[4] The stress response system thus has its role as an adaptive process to restore homeostasis in the body by actively making changes.[4][5] For instance, the body will involve in an endocrine system response in which corticosteroids are released. This process is known as allostasis, first proposed by Sterling and Eyer (1988).[6] Research has provided considerable evidence to illustrate the stress response as a short-term adaptive system.[4] The immediate effects of stress hormones are beneficial in a particular short-term situation. The system is arguably a protective defense against threats[5] and usually does not pose a health risk.[7]\nHowever, the problem arises when there is a persistent threat. First-time exposure to a stressor will trigger an acute stress response in the body; however, repeated and continuous exposure causes the stressor to become chronic.[4] McEwen and Stellar (1993) argued there is a \"hidden cost of chronic stress to the body over long time periods\".[8] That is often known as allostatic load. Chronic stress can cause the allostasis system to overstimulate in response to the persistent threat.[7] And such overstimulation can lead to an adverse impact. To illustrate, the long-term exposure to stress creates a high level of these hormones. This may lead to high blood pressure (and subsequently heart disease), damage to muscle tissue, inhibition of growth,[9] and damage to mental health. Chronic stress also relates directly to the functionality and structure of the nervous system, thereby influencing affective and physiological responses to stress.[3] These subsequently can result in damage to the body.\nHistorical development\n[edit]Hans Selye (1907–1982), known as the \"father of stress\",[10] is credited with first studying and identifying stress. He studied stress effects by subjecting lab mice to various physical, antigenic, and environmental stressors, including excessive exercise, starvation, and extreme temperatures. He determined that regardless of the type of stress, the mice exhibited similar physical effects, including thymus gland deterioration and the development of ulcers.[10] Selye then developed his theory of general adaptive syndrome (GAS) in 1936, known today as \"stress response\". He concluded that humans exposed to prolonged stress could also experience hormonal system breakdown and subsequently develop conditions such as heart disease and elevated blood pressure.[11] Selye considered these conditions to be \"diseases of adaptation\", or the effects of chronic stress caused by heightened hormonal and chemical levels.[10] His research on acute and chronic stress responses introduced stress to the medical field.[10]\nPhysiology\n[edit]Animals exposed to distressing events over which they have no control respond by releasing corticosteroids.[5] The sympathetic branch of the nervous system is activated, also releasing epinephrine and norepinephrine.[9]\nStress has a role in humans as a method of reacting to difficult and possibly dangerous situations. The \"fight or flight\" response when one perceives a threat helps the body exert energy to fight or run away to live another day. This response is noticeable when the adrenal glands release epinephrine, causing the blood vessels to constrict and heart rate to increase. In addition, cortisol is another hormone that is released under stress and its purpose is to raise the glucose level in the blood. Glucose is the main energy source for human cells and its increase during time of stress is for the purpose of having energy readily available for over active cells.[12]\nChronic stress is also known to be associated with an accelerated loss of telomeres in most but not all studies.[13][14]\nResponse\n[edit]Different types of stressors, the timing (duration) of the stressors, and genetic inherited personal characteristics all influence the response of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis to stressful situations. The hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis and other endocrine axes are also involved in the stress response. Those with a wealthy background have a stronger response to stress than those in the lower strata.[15][citation needed]\nResilience in chronic stress is defined as the ability to deal and cope with stresses in a healthy manner.[16] There are six categories of resources that affect an individual's coping resources:[16]\n- Personality (empathy/sympathy, commitment, optimism)\n- Ego-related traits (self-esteem, self-confidence, self-control)\n- Social connectivity (social network, available support)\n- Cultural views (religious beliefs, moral beliefs)\n- Behavioral skills (social skills, response to emotions management)\n- Other (socioeconomic status, general health)\nSymptoms\n[edit]People may experience anxiety,[17] depression,[18] sadness,[17] anger,[17] irritability,[17] social isolation, headache,[17] menstrual problems,[19] abdominal pain, back pain, muscle pains,[20] and difficulty concentrating.[21]\nImpacts\n[edit]Chronic stress causes the body to stay in a constant state of alertness, despite being in no danger. Extensive studies have provided evidence of the association between \"chronic stressors and physical health outcomes\" [3] Take caregiving as an example. A review of 37 studies has suggested that dementia caregivers subjected to chronic stress are more susceptible to diseases.[22] Although the connection between stress and health requires continuous research,[7] the existing findings have suggested the potential link between the two.\nBrain\n[edit]A primary target of stress is the brain. When exposed to stress, it serves as the centre to interpret the stressors and determine the appropriate behavioural and psychological responses.[7] Therefore, exposure to chronic stress will have a direct impact on brain function.[7] For instance, chronic stress inhibits neuron growth inside the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.[5] The neuronal atrophy in these two structures can lead to hypertrophy in amygdala, responsible for anxiety and stress.[23] In turn, this will lead to an increase of fear and aggression and impairment in learning ability. Memory and decision-making can also be negatively affected.[23] Additionally, chronic stress can suppress neural pathways active in cognition and decision-making, speeding up aging. Also, being chronically stressed worsens the damage caused by a stroke and can lead to sleep disorders due to the overexposure of cortisol.[24]\nOther systems\n[edit]The alterations in brain function can have a more extensive effect on other body systems. Since chronic stress is due to a wide variety of environmental, nutritional, chemical, pathological, or genetic[25] factors, a wide range of physiological systems can be damaged.[26] Prolonged stress can disturb the immune, digestive, cardiovascular, sleep, and reproductive systems.[17] For example, it was found that:\n- Chronic stress reduces resistance of infection and inflammation, and might even cause the immune system to attack itself.[27]\n- Stress responses can cause atrophy of muscles and increases in blood pressure.[28] When the stress is chronic, it will lead to sustained elevated blood pressure, impairing the heart functions.[7]\nMeasurement\n[edit]The advancement of the scientific study of stress will require better and more accurate measurement of the stress process. However, the complexity of stress has added difficulties to establish consistent and thorough measures.[3]\nChronic stress measures primarily comprise epidemiological studies that look at current experiences within specific life domains. Despite its significance, cumulative stress exposure from past experiences is often compromised due to practical difficulties such as limitations on time.[3] Another potential issue with measuring chronic stress is the validity. In particular for retrospective studies, the validity of the measure is strongly dependent on the accuracy of recollection. Biases and memory decay can contribute to underreporting. Similarly for prospective studies, the validity of the measures will depend on the accuracy of report and detection by the respondent and monitoring agencies.[3]\nIn regards to measuring stress responses, it is important to note that it can vary from person.[29] It is suggested that individual and environmental contextual factors, such as genes and culture, will contribute to one's vulnerability and resilience to stress. By contrast, protective factors, such as a supportive environment, can strengthen resilience.[3] The two factors are important as they influence the brain's judgment of the stressors. In addition, the interactions of different stressors will lead to cumulative stress exposure. These all together contribute to the differential stress responses.[3] The subjective differences thus may pose challenges for researchers.\nOwing to the complexity of measuring stress processes over the lifespan, many researchers decided on measuring more assessable aspects of stress. That includes: \"historic exposure, current exposure and responses across different time scale\".[3] In many cases, chronic stress is measured by its duration. Yet, there can be considerable variations in the criteria.[3] For example, the Life Events and Difficulties Schedule by Brown and Harris (1978)[30] proposed that chronic difficulty is characterised by a 4-week-cut-off. Alternatively, other researchers may define chronicity with a shorter or longer period. The implication is that studies on chronic stress may not necessarily have a uniform scale for comparison.\nSee also\n[edit]References\n[edit]- ^ a b \"APA Dictionary of Psychology\". dictionary.apa.org.

          "content": "Stress management\nStress management consists of a wide spectrum of techniques and psychotherapies aimed at controlling a person's level of psychological stress, especially chronic stress, generally for the purpose of improving the function of everyday life. Stress produces numerous physical and mental symptoms which vary according to each individual's situational factors. These can include a decline in physical health, such as headaches, chest pain, fatigue, sleep problems,[1] and depression. The process of stress management is a key factor that can lead to a happy and successful life in modern society.[citation needed] Stress management provides numerous ways to manage anxiety and maintain overall well-being.\nThere are several models of stress management, each with distinctive explanations of mechanisms for controlling stress. More research is necessary to provide a better understanding of which mechanisms actually operate and are effective in practice.\nStress management techniques\n[edit]Many stress management techniques cope with stresses one may find themselves withstanding. Some of the following ways listed help to reduce higher than usual stress levels temporarily or to compensate the biological issues involved; others face the stressors at a higher level of abstraction:\n- Autogenic training\n- Social activity\n- Cognitive therapy\n- Conflict resolution\n- Cranial release technique\n- Getting a hobby\n- Meditation\n- Mindfulness\n- Music as a coping strategy\n- Deep breathing\n- Yoga Nidra\n- Nootropics\n- Reading novels\n- Prayer\n- Relaxation techniques\n- Artistic expression\n- Fractional relaxation\n- Humour\n- Physical exercise\n- Progressive relaxation\n- Spas\n- Somatics training\n- Spending time in nature\n- Stress balls\n- Natural medicine\n- Clinically validated alternative treatments\n- Time management\n- Planning and decision making\n- Listening to certain types of relaxing music[2][3]\n- Spending quality time with pets\n- Art Therapy/Coloring\nSome sources of stress stem from high levels of demand that require extra effort and workload. In such cases, creating a time schedule can help—one that temporarily reduces the usual frequency and duration of previous commitments until the period of increased personal demands has passed.\nTechniques of stress management will vary according to the philosophical paradigm.[4]\nHistorical foundations\n[edit]Walter Cannon and Hans Selye used animal studies to establish the earliest scientific basis for the study of stress. They measured the physiological responses of animals to external pressures, such as heat and cold, prolonged restraint, and surgical procedures then extrapolated from these studies to human beings.[5][6]\nSubsequent studies of stress in humans by Richard Rahe and others established that stress is caused by distinct, measurable life stressors, and that these life stressors can be ranked by the median degree of stress they produce (leading to the Holmes and Rahe stress scale). Holmes and Rahe is focused on how life's stressors can influence ones health and wellness. The scale was developed to measure the effects of stress on health using life change units, in an attempt to quantify stress and its correlation to illness. Thus, stress was traditionally conceptualized to be a result of external insults beyond the control of those experiencing the stress. More recently, however, it has been argued that external circumstances do not have any intrinsic capacity to produce stress, but instead, their effect is mediated by the individual's perceptions, capacities, and understanding.\nThere are several models of stress management, each with distinctive explanations of mechanisms for controlling stress. Much more research is necessary to provide a better understanding of which mechanisms actually operate and are effective in practice.\nModels\n[edit]The generalized models are:\n- The emergency response/fight-or-flight response by Walter Cannon (1914, 1932)\n- General Adaptation Syndrome by Hans Selye (1936)\n- Stress Model of Henry and Stephens (1977)\n- Transactional (or cognitive) Stress Model / stress model of Lazarus after Lazarus (1974)\n- Theory of resource conservation by Stevan Hobfoll (1988, 1998; Hobfoll & Buchwald, 2004)\nTransactional model\n[edit]In 1981, Richard Lazarus and Susan Folkman suggested that stress can be thought of as resulting from an \"imbalance between demands and resources\" or as occurring when \"pressure exceeds one's perceived ability to cope\". Stress management was developed and premised on the idea that stress is not a direct response to a stressor but rather an individual's resources and abilities to cope and mediate the stress response which are amenable to change, thus allowing stress to be controllable.[7][8]\nAmong the many stressors mentioned by employees, these are the most common:\n- Conflicts in company\n- How the company treats co-workers[9]\nIn order to develop an effective stress management program, it is first necessary to identify the factors that are central to a person controlling his/her stress and to identify the intervention methods which effectively target these factors. Lazarus and Folkman's interpretation of stress focuses on the transaction between people and their external environment (known as the Transactional Model). The model contends that stress may not be a stressors if the person does not perceive the stressors as a threat but rather as positive or even challenging. Also, if the person possesses or can use adequate coping skills, then stress may not actually be a result or develop because of the stressors. The model proposes that people can be taught to manage their stress and cope with their stressors. They may learn to change their perspective of the stressors and provide them with the ability and confidence to improve their lives and handle all of the types of stressors.\nHealth realization/innate health model\n[edit]The health realization/innate health model of stress is founded on the idea that stress does not necessarily follow the presence of a potential stressor. Instead of focusing on the individual's appraisal of so-called stressors in relation to his or her own coping skills (as the transactional model does), the health realization model focuses on the nature of thought, stating that it is ultimately a person's thought processes that determines the response to potentially stressful external circumstances. In this model, stress results from appraising oneself and one's circumstances through a mental filter of insecurity and negativity, whereas a feeling of well-being results from approaching the world with a \"quiet mind\".[10][11] This theory deposits that moods fluctuate and cannot be changed by a specific pattern of thinking. Mental discomfort is only deepened by focus on how to change one's mood, so moods should be \"waited out\" and dwelling avoided based on this framework.[12] This model proposes that helping stressed individuals understand the nature of thought—especially providing them with the ability to recognize when they are in the grip of insecure thinking, disengage from it, and access natural positive feelings—will reduce their stress.\nStress prevention and resilience\n[edit]Although many techniques have traditionally been developed to deal with the consequences of stress, considerable research has also been conducted on the prevention of stress, a subject closely related to psychological resilience-building. A number of self-help approaches to stress-prevention and resilience-building have been developed, drawing mainly on the theory and practice of cognitive-behavioral therapy.[13]\nMeasuring stress\n[edit]There are different ways to measure stress levels. One way is through psychological testing. The Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale is used to rate stressful life events and how life stressors influence illness. The DASS (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales) contains a scale for stress based on self-report items. Changes in blood pressure and galvanic skin response can also be measured to test stress levels. A digital thermometer can be used to evaluate changes in skin temperature, which can indicate activation of the fight-or-flight response drawing blood away from the extremities. Cortisol is the main hormone released during a stress response and measuring cortisol from hair will give a 60- to 90-day baseline stress level of an individual. This method of measuring stress is currently the most popular method in the clinic .\nDespite stress often being thought of as a subjective experience, levels of stress are readily measurable; using various physiological tests, similar to those used in polygraphs. An example of stress being measured is using nano EEG sensors in detecting stress.[14]\nEffectiveness\n[edit]Stress management has physiological and immune benefits.[15]\nPositive outcomes are observed using a combination of non-drug interventions:[16]\n- treatment of anger or hostility,\n- autogenic training which is a relaxation technique used to reduce stress and bring the mind and the body into balance through repeated exercises, such as deep breathing, to promote mental relaxation. Research done by L. Varvogli and C. Darviri shows that this technique has several therapeutic health benefits aiding in those that experienced tension headaches, heart disease, anxiety, and many others.[17]\n- talking therapy (around relationship or existential issues)\n- biofeedback allows people to monitor their bodies internal function such as, heart rate, muscle tension, temperature, and use this information to learn how to control the bodies response which can lead to better physical, mental, and emotional health. Some consider it to be effective however critics have compared its efficacy[18] to that of conventional therapies as well as the cost effectiveness of biofeedback is uncertain.\n- cognitive therapy for anxiety or clinical depression\nStress management programs\n[edit]Many businesses have begun to use stress management programs for employees who are having trouble adapting to stress at the workplace or at home. Some companies provide special equipment adapting to stress in the workplace to their employees, like coloring diaries[19] and stress relieving gadgets.[20] Many people have spill over stress from home into their working environment. There are a couple of ways businesses try to reduce the stress levels of their employees. One way is through individual intervention. This starts off by monitoring the stressors of the individual. After monitoring what causes the stress, next is attacking that stressor and trying to figure out ways to alleviate them. Developing social support is vital in individual intervention, being with others to help you cope has proven to be a very effective way to avoid stress.[citation needed] Changing behavioral patterns, may in turn, help reduce some of the stress that is put on at work as well.\nEmployee assistance programs can include in-house counseling programs on managing stress. Evaluative research has been conducted on EAPs that teach individuals stress control and inoculation techniques such as relaxation, biofeedback, and cognitive restructuring. Studies show that these programs can reduce the level of physiological arousal associated with high stress. Participants who master behavioral and cognitive stress-relief techniques report less tension, fewer sleep disturbances, and an improved ability to cope with workplace stressors.[21]\nAnother way of reducing stress at work is by simply changing the workload for an employee, or even giving them more control as to when or where they work.[22]\nImproving communications between employees is very effective for helping reduce stress.[23] Making the employee feel like they are a bigger part of the company, by giving them a voice in bigger situations shows trust and value in their opinion. Having all the employees cooperate with each other is an underlying factor which can take away much of workplace stress. Lastly, changing the physical qualities of the workplace may reduce stress. Changing things such as the lighting, air temperature, odor, and up to date technology.[24]\nIntervention is broken down into three steps: primary, secondary, tertiary. Primary deals with eliminating the stressors altogether. Secondary deals with detecting stress and figuring out ways to cope with it and improving stress management skills. Finally, tertiary deals with recovery and rehabbing the stress altogether. These three steps are usually the most effective way to deal with stress not just in the workplace, but overall.[25]\nTypes of stress\n[edit]Acute stress\n[edit]Acute stress is the most common form of stress among humans worldwide.[26] It deals with the pressures of the near future or the very recent past. While acute stress is often interpreted as being a negative experience, it can actually be beneficial and even necessary for one's wellbeing because of its protective effects against potentially dangerous threats.[27] Slamming on the brakes while driving in order to avoid a car accident could be considered a moment of beneficial acute stress.[28] Running or any other form of exercise would also be considered an acute stressor. Some exciting or exhilarating experiences such as riding a roller coaster is an acute stress but is usually very enjoyable. Acute stress is a short term stress and as a result, does not have enough time to do the damage that long term stress causes.[29]\nChronic stress\n[edit]Unlike acute stress, which only lasts for a moment, chronic stress lasts for longer time spans. It has a wearing effect on people that can become a very serious health risk if it continues over a long period of time.\nChronic stress can lead to memory loss, damage spatial recognition and produce a decreased drive of eating. Additional symptoms of chronic stress include aches and pains, insomnia or other sleep disturbances, changes in social behaviors, low energy, emotional withdrawal or other changes in emotional responses, and unfocused thinking.[30] Chronic stress has also been associated with other medical conditions such as hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and arthritis.[31]\nThe severity varies from person to person. Gender difference can also be an underlying factor. Women are able to take longer durations of stress than men without showing the same maladaptive changes. Men can deal with shorter stress duration better than women can. If men hit a certain threshold, the chances of them developing mental issues increase drastically.[32]\nChronic stress is a major health issue that affects people of all ages and can have profound effects on physical and mental health. It is a long-standing, unrelieved, and unavoidable stress, that include busy work, school schedules, and complex relationships. Over time, chronic stress can alter the body's systems, leading to a variety of illnesses and conditions.[33]\nStress in the workplace\n[edit]In the workplace, managing stress becomes vital in order to keep up job performance as well as relationship with co-workers and employers.[34][35] For some workers, changing the work environment relieves work stress. Making the environment less competitive between employees decreases some amounts of stress.[36][citation needed]Companies and businesses tend to be more successful when the work environment facilitates more cooperation rather than competition. In the workplace, people feel more comfortable and capable of completing the work due to their support from coworkers and employers. As a result, both companies and employees benefit from a cooperating relationship. Competition in the workplace can leave employees feeling like it is “every man for himself” which can increase stress.[37]\nAuthor J, Carr [38] highlighted three areas of the workplace that affects the levels of stress experienced. Job demands, individual differences, and social demands. These areas that heighten stress are addressed in Rahe's scale suggesting that some of the greatest stressors in life are connected to the workplace. Stress in the workplace does not always have to be negatively viewed. When managed well, stress can increase employees' focus and productivity. According to the Yerkes–Dodson law, stress is beneficial to human functioning, but only up to a point. People who experience very low levels of stress might feel under stimulated and passive, while those with excessively high levels of stress may feel overwhelmed, anxious, and irritable. Thus, establishing an optimum level of stress is key.[39]\nOrganizational stress levels that an individual faces is dependent not just on external factors such as job characteristics or environment, but also on intrapersonal factors such as personality, temperament, and individual coping and thinking styles.[citation needed]\nAlso, stress at workplace is not limited to employees. Entrepreneurs also undergo stress[40] This stress can vary from team management, business management or unfavorable policy from the government.\nCommitment\n[edit]Some examples of stressors in the workplace can be their perception of Organization Commitment, which is the way an employee conceptualizes his/her reasons for staying in the organizations for either Affective, Continuance, or Normative reasons.[41] Affective commitment to the organization is the situation where an employee strongly identifies with the values and culture of the organization. While this is not directly telling of an employee's stress levels, it is a genuine interest and enjoyment in the employee's work and work relations that places the employee in a good position to manage stress well. Employees who stay in an organization for continuance reasons stay as a result of weighing the pros and cons, and then decides that the opportunity cost of leaving the organization is too high. Employees under this category might experience moderate levels of stress, as their reasons for staying is driven more by external rather than internal motivation. Employees who stay for normative reasons, however, are most likely to experience the highest levels of stress, as these are the employees who stay out of obligation and duty.[42]\nCulture differences\n[edit]Cultural differences have also shown to have some major effects on stress coping problems. Eastern Asian employees may deal with certain work situations differently from how a Western North American employee would.[43] In a study conducted in Malaysia, it was found that while the classification of workplace stress is similar between Malaysians and Western employees, the perception of workplace stress as well as the approaches to coping with stress were different.[43] In order to manage stress in the workplace, employers can provide stress managing programs[44] such as therapy, communication programs, and a more flexible work schedule.[45] There have been many studies conducted demonstrating the benefits of mindfulness practices on subjective well-being and work outcomes.[46] Productivity, organization, and performance increase, while burnout rates decrease. Individuals who received either low or high levels of support from their supervisors for stress management usually viewed the intervention positively. This perception was described in terms of the intervention either compensating for or complementing their work environment, depending on the level of support received.[47]\nStress in the wedical environment\n[edit]A study was done on the stress levels in general practitioners and hospital consultants in 1999. Over 500 medical employees participated in this study done by R.P Caplan. These results showed that 47% of the workers scored high on their questionnaire for high levels of stress. 27% of the general practitioners even scored to be very depressed. Managers stress levels were not as high as the actual practitioners themselves. An eye opening statistic showed that nearly 54% of workers suffered from anxiety while being in the hospital. Although this was a small sample size for hospitals around the world, Caplan feels this trend is probably fairly accurate across the majority of hospitals.[48]\nIn addition, there is a study that the objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between work performance and self-reported symptoms of depression, stress, and anxiety among nurses working in tuberculosis (TB)/HIV and COVID-19 units on Timor Island, Indonesia. The study used a comparative, cross-sectional design and collected data between October 2020 and January 2021. The study group comprised 236 nurses working in TB/HIV isolation rooms and 423 nurses in COVID-19 isolation rooms. The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress scale (DASS-42) and a work performance questionnaire were used to collect data, which were analyzed using independent t-testing and Pearson correlation coefficient. The results showed that the mean DASS-42 scores of nurses in TB/HIV isolation units were low, indicating minimal effects, while those in COVID-19 isolation units demonstrated moderate levels of depression, stress, and anxiety. Additionally, the work performance results indicated that the nurses in the TB/HIV isolation rooms had sufficient work performance, while those in the COVID-19 isolation rooms had weaker work performance. There was a significant difference in work performance between nurses in the two units. The study concluded that there was a correlation between nurses' depression, stress, and anxiety levels and their work performance in TB/HIV and COVID-19 isolation units.[49]\nStress in the aviation industry\n[edit]Aviation is a high-stress industry, given that it requires a high level of precision at all times. Chronically high stress levels can ultimately decrease the performance and compromise safety.[50] To be effective, stress measurement tools must be specific to the aviation industry, given its unique working environment and other stressors.[51] Stress measurement in aviation seeks to quantify the psychological stress experienced by aviators, with the goal of making needed improvements to aviators' coping and stress management skills.[51]\nTo more precisely measure stress, aviators' many responsibilities are broken down into \"workloads.\" This helps to categorize the broad concept of \"stress\" by specific stressors.[52] Additionally, since different workloads may pose unique stressors, this method may be more effective than measuring stress levels as a whole. Stress measurement tools can then help aviators identify which stressors are most problematic for them, and help them improve on managing workloads, planning tasks, and coping with stress more effectively.\nTo evaluate workload, a number of tools can be used. The major types of measurement tools are:\n- Performance-based measures;\n- Subjective measures, like questionnaires which aviators answer themselves; and\n- Physiological measures, like measurement of heart rate.[51]\nImplementation of evaluation tools requires time, instruments for measurement, and software for collecting data.[51]\nMeasurement systems\n[edit]The most commonly used stress measurement systems are primarily rating scale-based. These systems tend to be complex, containing multiple levels with a variety of sections, to attempt to capture the many stressors present in the aviation industry. Different systems may be utilized in different operational specialties.\n- The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) – The PSS is a widely used subjective tool for measuring stress levels.[53] It consists of 10 questions, and asks participants to rate, on a five-point scale, how stressed they felt after a certain event. All 10 questions are summed to obtain a total score from 0 to 40.[54] In the aviation industry, for example, it has been used with flight training students to measure how stressed they felt after flight training exercises.[54]\n- The Coping Skills Inventory – This inventory measures aviators' skills for coping with stress. This is another subjective measure, asking participants to rate, on a five-point scale, the extent to which they use eight common coping skills:[54] Substance abuse, Emotional support, Instrumental support (help with tangible things, like child care, finances, or task sharing), Positive reframing (changing one's thinking about a negative event, and thinking of it as a positive instead), Self-blame, Planning, Humour and Religion. An individual's total score indicates the extent to which he or she is using effective, positive coping skills (like humor and emotional support); ineffective, negative coping skills (like substance abuse and self-blame); and where the individual could improve.\n- The Subjective Workload Assessment Technique (SWAT) – SWAT is a rating system used to measure individuals' perceived mental workload while performing a task, like developing instruments in a lab, multitasking aircraft duties, or conducting air defense.[55] SWAT combines measurements and scaling techniques to develop a global rating scale.\nPilot stress report systems\n[edit]Early pilot stress report systems were adapted and modified from existing psychological questionnaires and surveys.[56] The data from these pilot-specific surveys is then processed and analyzed through an aviation-focused system or scale. Pilot-oriented questionnaires are generally designed to study work stress or home stress.[56] Self-report can also be used to measure a combination of home stress, work stress, and perceived performance. A study conducted by Fiedler, Della Rocco, Schroeder and Nguyen (2000) used Sloan and Cooper's modification of the Alkov questionnaire to explore aviators' perceptions of the relationship between different types of stress. The results indicated that pilots believed performance was impaired when home stress carried over to the work environment. The degree of home stress that carried over to work environment was significantly and negatively related to flying performance items, such as planning, control, and accuracy of landings. The questionnaire was able to reflect pilots' retroactive perceptions and the accuracy of these perceptions.[57]\nAlkov, Borowsky, and Gaynor started a 22-item questionnaire for U.S. Naval aviators in 1982 to test the hypothesis that inadequate stress coping strategies contributed to flight mishaps.[56] The questionnaire consists of items related to lifestyle changes and personality characteristics. After completing the questionnaire, the test group is divided into two groups: \"at-fault\" with mishap, and \"not-at-fault\" in a mishap. Then, questionnaires from these two groups were analyzed to examine differences.[58] A study of British commercial airline pilots, conducted by Sloan and Cooper (1986), surveyed 1,000 pilot members from the British Airline Pilots' Association (BALPA). They used a modified version of Alkov, Borowsky, and Gaynor's questionnaire to collect data on pilots' perceptions of the relationship between stress and performance. Being a subjective measure, this study's data was based on pilots' perceptions, and thus rely on how accurately they recall past experiences their relationships to stress. Despite relying on subjective perceptions and memories, the study showed that pilot reports are noteworthy.[56]\nBeck Depression Inventory (BDI) is another scale used in many industries, including the mental health professions, to screen for depressive symptoms.[59]\nParsa and Kapadia (1997) used the BDI to survey a group of 57 U.S. Air Force fighter pilots who had flown combat operations.[56] The adaptation of the BDI to the aviation field was problematic. However, the study revealed some unexpected findings. The results indicated that 89% of the pilots reported insomnia; 86% reported irritability; 63%, dissatisfaction; 38%, guilt; and 35%, loss of libido. 50% of two squadrons and 33% of another squadron scored above 9 on the BDI, suggesting at least low levels of depression. Such measurement may be difficult to interpret accurately.[why?]\nStress in College\n[edit]College can be a particularly stressful period for many students as they adjust to a new and often unfamiliar environment while transitioning from adolescence to adulthood. Nearly 80% of college students report frequently experiencing daily stress.[60] Sources of stress that influence college students’ stress levels include family and friends who are often physically further away, along with shifts in communication patterns with these individuals. Other influential factors include long-held beliefs (i.e. religious beliefs) and new opportunities for various behavior (i.e. alcohol and drug use). In addition to these potential sources of stress, college students are often faced with rigorous academic demands.[61] To manage these challenges, students tend to rely on many strategies including problem-focused and emotion-focused coping.[62]\nProblem-focused strategies employ action-oriented behavioral activities such as planning. Emotion-focused strategies involve the expression of emotion and often include the altering of expectations. Although problem-focused strategies have often been found to be more effective than emotion-focused strategies, both categories include coping mechanisms that effectively reduce the negative impacts of stress.[63][64]\nPractical examples of problem-focused strategies include developing time management skills, avoiding procrastination, and setting goals. These skills help students prioritize responsibilities, allowing more time for restorative activities like sleep and leisure activities, both of which are linked to lower stress levels. Healthy sleep patterns, in particular, are strongly associated with improved stress management. Working towards or maintaining healthy sleep habits helps individuals better cope with high levels of stress.[65][66]\nEmotion-focused strategies have also been found to be effective in combating stress. Accommodation strategies that do not directly change the stressor, but rather help to change one's emotions surrounding the stressors, such as positive reframing, are widely associated with stress reduction.[67] Strategies such as using humor and journaling—especially gratitude journaling are also effective methods for reducing stress .[68][66] While these strategies don't change the stressor itself, they help students better regulate their emotional response.\nAnother emotion-focused strategy gaining popularity among college students is art therapy and creative expression through activities like coloring. Particularly for college students, who are often exposed to a variety of stressors such as academic performance, family problems, and social disturbances, these stressors can have a significant negative impact on their lives and overall well-being.[69] Given the commonness of stress among college students, understanding the role of coloring in stress reduction is critical as college students are seen as more prone to stress in all forms.[70] Moreover, stress among college students can have profound effects on academic performance, with 18.2% of students claiming anxiety as their primary stressor, significantly impacting their ability to perform academically.[71] To cope, many students turn to activities like working out or participating in recreational hobbies. However, simpler activities such as coloring can also be highly effective in reducing stress levels. Coloring therapy, or different coloring activities, offer a creative approach to stress reduction, harnessing the therapeutic essence of artistic expression to promote relaxation and reduce unwanted emotions without the use of excessive skill or focus.[72] Coloring is suggested to offer benefits to well-being by providing a structured activity that avoids overwhelming individuals with too many decisions, such as what to draw, while still promoting engagement and facilitating mindfulness.[73][72] Engaging in artistic activities has been shown to reduce anxiety and promote mindfulness by allowing individuals to focus on the present moment. Coloring, in particular, has been found to lower stress levels and induce a meditative state, especially when using structured patterns like mandalas.[74] These creative outlets offer students a non-verbal way to process emotions and find calm during stressful periods.\nWithout effective coping skills, students may turn to harmful behaviors as a means of temporary relief. [citation needed] Common but unsafe coping strategies among college students include drinking excessively, drug use, excessive caffeine consumption, withdrawal from social activities, self-harm, and eating disorders.[60] These behaviors often become habitual, addictive, and sometimes fatal and may worsen stress in the long run.[75] For example, when college students turn to drinking as a way of coping with stress, they may gradually consume more alcohol more frequently, rather than occasional drinking with friends. This can lead to an increased risk for addiction, alcohol poisoning, and other dangerous behaviors.\nWhile researchers have found no significant gender differences in the use of problem-focused coping strategies, there are distinctions of gender variation in regard to emotion-focused coping. Women tend to use emotion-focused coping strategies more often than men. However, men do report using one emotion-focused coping strategy more often than women—mental disengagement in the form of alcohol use.[64] Mental disengagement refers to when individuals refocus their negative emotions to an alternative resource, such as alcohol, instead of addressing the original stressor.[76] Women also report higher stress levels overall, especially in areas like social relationships, daily hassles, finances, self-imposed stress, frustration, and academics.[64] This could be because women are often more in-tune to their emotions and are more comfortable expressing their feelings.[77]\nWhile stress for college students is part of the transitional experience, there are many strategies that students can use to reduce stress in their lives and manage the impacts of stress. Time management skills, which encompass goal setting, scheduling, and pacing are effective approaches to reducing stress. Additionally, maintaining one's physical and mental health through regular exercise, balanced nutrition, quality sleep, and mindfulness practices can also play a critical role.[66] There are several services, such as counseling and therapy, available to students that can be accessed both on and off campus to support stress management and overall student wellbeing. Adults in college benefit fairly equally from methods that are more directly related to stress management (such as time management and relaxation exercises) and being physically active (such as adding running or weight lifting into your regular routine).[78]\nAn approach for stress relief commonly adopted by college students is engaging in gaming as a hobby. While some research suggests a negative relationship between video game usage and academic performance, several studies indicate a positive correlation between stress reduction and playing casual video games. For instance, one study demonstrated that engaging in casual video games effectively decreased psychological and physiological stress levels among students, with comparable benefits to stress-relieving meditation. When utilized with appropriate time management, video gaming can serve as a viable stress-relief strategy for college students.[79]\nSee also\n[edit]- Abusive power and control\n- European Academy of Occupational Health Psychology\n- International Journal of Stress Management\n- Journal of Occupational Health Psychology\n- Occupational health psychology\n- Society for Occupational Health Psychology\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ \"How stress affects your body and behavior\".

          "content": "Regression analysis\nIn statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable (often called the outcome or response variable, or a label in machine learning parlance) and one or more error-free independent variables (often called regressors, predictors, covariates, explanatory variables or features).\nThe most common form of regression analysis is linear regression, in which one finds the line (or a more complex linear combination) that most closely fits the data according to a specific mathematical criterion. For example, the method of ordinary least squares computes the unique line (or hyperplane) that minimizes the sum of squared differences between the true data and that line (or hyperplane). For specific mathematical reasons (see linear regression), this allows the researcher to estimate the conditional expectation (or population average value) of the dependent variable when the independent variables take on a given set of values. Less common forms of regression use slightly different procedures to estimate alternative location parameters (e.g., quantile regression or Necessary Condition Analysis[1]) or estimate the conditional expectation across a broader collection of non-linear models (e.g., nonparametric regression).\nRegression analysis is primarily used for two conceptually distinct purposes. First, regression analysis is widely used for prediction and forecasting, where its use has substantial overlap with the field of machine learning. Second, in some situations regression analysis can be used to infer causal relationships between the independent and dependent variables. Importantly, regressions by themselves only reveal relationships between a dependent variable and a collection of independent variables in a fixed dataset. To use regressions for prediction or to infer causal relationships, respectively, a researcher must carefully justify why existing relationships have predictive power for a new context or why a relationship between two variables has a causal interpretation. The latter is especially important when researchers hope to estimate causal relationships using observational data.[2][3]\nHistory\n[edit]The earliest regression form was seen in Isaac Newton's work in 1700 while studying equinoxes, being credited with introducing \"an embryonic linear aggression analysis\" as \"Not only did he perform the averaging of a set of data, 50 years before Tobias Mayer, but summing the residuals to zero he forced the regression line to pass through the average point. He also distinguished between two inhomogeneous sets of data and might have thought of an optimal solution in terms of bias, though not in terms of effectiveness.\" He previously used an averaging method in his 1671 work on Newton's rings, which was unprecedented at the time.[4][5]\nThe method of least squares was published by Legendre in 1805,[6] and by Gauss in 1809.[7] Legendre and Gauss both applied the method to the problem of determining, from astronomical observations, the orbits of bodies about the Sun (mostly comets, but also later the then newly discovered minor planets). Gauss published a further development of the theory of least squares in 1821,[8] including a version of the Gauss–Markov theorem.\nThe term \"regression\" was coined by Francis Galton in the 19th century to describe a biological phenomenon. The phenomenon was that the heights of descendants of tall ancestors tend to regress down towards a normal average (a phenomenon also known as regression toward the mean).[9][10] For Galton, regression had only this biological meaning,[11][12] but his work was later extended by Udny Yule and Karl Pearson to a more general statistical context.[13][14] In the work of Yule and Pearson, the joint distribution of the response and explanatory variables is assumed to be Gaussian. This assumption was weakened by R.A. Fisher in his works of 1922 and 1925.[15][16][17] Fisher assumed that the conditional distribution of the response variable is Gaussian, but the joint distribution need not be. In this respect, Fisher's assumption is closer to Gauss's formulation of 1821.\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, economists used electromechanical desk calculators to calculate regressions. Before 1970, it sometimes took up to 24 hours to receive the result from one regression.[18]\nRegression methods continue to be an area of active research. In recent decades, new methods have been developed for robust regression, regression involving correlated responses such as time series and growth curves, regression in which the predictor (independent variable) or response variables are curves, images, graphs, or other complex data objects, regression methods accommodating various types of missing data, nonparametric regression, Bayesian methods for regression, regression in which the predictor variables are measured with error, regression with more predictor variables than observations, and causal inference with regression. Modern regression analysis is typically done with statistical and spreadsheet software packages on computers as well as on handheld scientific and graphing calculators.\nRegression model\n[edit]In practice, researchers first select a model they would like to estimate and then use their chosen method (e.g., ordinary least squares) to estimate the parameters of that model. Regression models involve the following components:\n- The unknown parameters, often denoted as a scalar or vector .\n- The independent variables, which are observed in data and are often denoted as a vector (where denotes a row of data).\n- The dependent variable, which are observed in data and often denoted using the scalar .\n- The error terms, which are not directly observed in data and are often denoted using the scalar .\nIn various fields of application, different terminologies are used in place of dependent and independent variables.\nMost regression models propose that is a function (regression function) of and , with representing an additive error term that may stand in for un-modeled determinants of or random statistical noise:\nNote that the independent variables are assumed to be free of error. This important assumption is often overlooked, although errors-in-variables models can be used when the independent variables are assumed to contain errors.\nThe researchers' goal is to estimate the function that most closely fits the data. To carry out regression analysis, the form of the function must be specified. Sometimes the form of this function is based on knowledge about the relationship between and that does not rely on the data. If no such knowledge is available, a flexible or convenient form for is chosen. For example, a simple univariate regression may propose , suggesting that the researcher believes to be a reasonable approximation for the statistical process generating the data.\nOnce researchers determine their preferred statistical model, different forms of regression analysis provide tools to estimate the parameters . For example, least squares (including its most common variant, ordinary least squares) finds the value of that minimizes the sum of squared errors . A given regression method will ultimately provide an estimate of , usually denoted to distinguish the estimate from the true (unknown) parameter value that generated the data. Using this estimate, the researcher can then use the fitted value for prediction or to assess the accuracy of the model in explaining the data. Whether the researcher is intrinsically interested in the estimate or the predicted value will depend on context and their goals. As described in ordinary least squares, least squares is widely used because the estimated function approximates the conditional expectation .[7] However, alternative variants (e.g., least absolute deviations or quantile regression) are useful when researchers want to model other functions .\nIt is important to note that there must be sufficient data to estimate a regression model. For example, suppose that a researcher has access to rows of data with one dependent and two independent variables: . Suppose further that the researcher wants to estimate a bivariate linear model via least squares: . If the researcher only has access to data points, then they could find infinitely many combinations that explain the data equally well: any combination can be chosen that satisfies , all of which lead to and are therefore valid solutions that minimize the sum of squared residuals. To understand why there are infinitely many options, note that the system of equations is to be solved for 3 unknowns, which makes the system underdetermined. Alternatively, one can visualize infinitely many 3-dimensional planes that go through fixed points.\nMore generally, to estimate a least squares model with distinct parameters, one must have distinct data points. If , then there does not generally exist a set of parameters that will perfectly fit the data. The quantity appears often in regression analysis, and is referred to as the degrees of freedom in the model. Moreover, to estimate a least squares model, the independent variables must be linearly independent: one must not be able to reconstruct any of the independent variables by adding and multiplying the remaining independent variables. As discussed in ordinary least squares, this condition ensures that is an invertible matrix and therefore that a unique solution exists.\nUnderlying assumptions\n[edit]By itself, a regression is simply a calculation using the data. In order to interpret the output of regression as a meaningful statistical quantity that measures real-world relationships, researchers often rely on a number of classical assumptions. These assumptions often include:\n- The sample is representative of the population at large.\n- The independent variables are measured without error.\n- Deviations from the model have an expected value of zero, conditional on covariates:\n- The variance of the residuals is constant across observations (homoscedasticity).\n- The residuals are uncorrelated with one another. Mathematically, the variance–covariance matrix of the errors is diagonal.\nA handful of conditions are sufficient for the least-squares estimator to possess desirable properties: in particular, the Gauss–Markov assumptions imply that the parameter estimates will be unbiased, consistent, and efficient in the class of linear unbiased estimators. Practitioners have developed a variety of methods to maintain some or all of these desirable properties in real-world settings, because these classical assumptions are unlikely to hold exactly. For example, modeling errors-in-variables can lead to reasonable estimates independent variables are measured with errors. Heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors allow the variance of to change across values of . Correlated errors that exist within subsets of the data or follow specific patterns can be handled using clustered standard errors, geographic weighted regression, or Newey–West standard errors, among other techniques. When rows of data correspond to locations in space, the choice of how to model within geographic units can have important consequences.[19][20] The subfield of econometrics is largely focused on developing techniques that allow researchers to make reasonable real-world conclusions in real-world settings, where classical assumptions do not hold exactly.\nLinear regression\n[edit]In linear regression, the model specification is that the dependent variable, is a linear combination of the parameters (but need not be linear in the independent variables). For example, in simple linear regression for modeling data points there is one independent variable: , and two parameters, and :\n- straight line:\nIn multiple linear regression, there are several independent variables or functions of independent variables.\nAdding a term in to the preceding regression gives:\n- parabola:\nThis is still linear regression; although the expression on the right hand side is quadratic in the independent variable , it is linear in the parameters , and\nIn both cases, is an error term and the subscript indexes a particular observation.\nReturning our attention to the straight line case: Given a random sample from the population, we estimate the population parameters and obtain the sample linear regression model:\nThe residual, , is the difference between the value of the dependent variable predicted by the model, , and the true value of the dependent variable, . One method of estimation is ordinary least squares. This method obtains parameter estimates that minimize the sum of squared residuals, SSR:\nMinimization of this function results in a set of normal equations, a set of simultaneous linear equations in the parameters, which are solved to yield the parameter estimators, .\nIn the case of simple regression, the formulas for the least squares estimates are\nwhere is the mean (average) of the values and is the mean of the values.\nUnder the assumption that the population error term has a constant variance, the estimate of that variance is given by:\nThis is called the mean square error (MSE) of the regression. The denominator is the sample size reduced by the number of model parameters estimated from the same data, for regressors or if an intercept is used.[21] In this case, so the denominator is .\nThe standard errors of the parameter estimates are given by\nUnder the further assumption that the population error term is normally distributed, the researcher can use these estimated standard errors to create confidence intervals and conduct hypothesis tests about the population parameters.\nGeneral linear model\n[edit]In the more general multiple regression model, there are independent variables:\nwhere is the -th observation on the -th independent variable. If the first independent variable takes the value 1 for all , , then is called the regression intercept.\nThe least squares parameter estimates are obtained from normal equations. The residual can be written as\nThe normal equations are\nIn matrix notation, the normal equations are written as\nwhere the element of is , the element of the column vector is , and the element of is . Thus is , is , and is . The solution is\nDiagnostics\n[edit]Once a regression model has been constructed, it may be important to confirm the goodness of fit of the model and the statistical significance of the estimated parameters. Commonly used checks of goodness of fit include the R-squared, analyses of the pattern of residuals and hypothesis testing. Statistical significance can be checked by an F-test of the overall fit, followed by t-tests of individual parameters.\nInterpretations of these diagnostic tests rest heavily on the model's assumptions. Although examination of the residuals can be used to invalidate a model, the results of a t-test or F-test are sometimes more difficult to interpret if the model's assumptions are violated. For example, if the error term does not have a normal distribution, in small samples the estimated parameters will not follow normal distributions and complicate inference. With relatively large samples, however, a central limit theorem can be invoked such that hypothesis testing may proceed using asymptotic approximations.\nLimited dependent variables\n[edit]Limited dependent variables, which are response variables that are categorical or constrained to fall only in a certain range, often arise in econometrics.\nThe response variable may be non-continuous (\"limited\" to lie on some subset of the real line). For binary (zero or one) variables, if analysis proceeds with least-squares linear regression, the model is called the linear probability model. Nonlinear models for binary dependent variables include the probit and logit model. The multivariate probit model is a standard method of estimating a joint relationship between several binary dependent variables and some independent variables. For categorical variables with more than two values there is the multinomial logit. For ordinal variables with more than two values, there are the ordered logit and ordered probit models. Censored regression models may be used when the dependent variable is only sometimes observed, and Heckman correction type models may be used when the sample is not randomly selected from the population of interest.\nAn alternative to such procedures is linear regression based on polychoric correlation (or polyserial correlations) between the categorical variables. Such procedures differ in the assumptions made about the distribution of the variables in the population. If the variable is positive with low values and represents the repetition of the occurrence of an event, then count models like the Poisson regression or the negative binomial model may be used.\nNonlinear regression\n[edit]When the model function is not linear in the parameters, the sum of squares must be minimized by an iterative procedure. This introduces many complications which are summarized in Differences between linear and non-linear least squares.\nPrediction (interpolation and extrapolation)\n[edit]Regression models predict a value of the Y variable given known values of the X variables. Prediction within the range of values in the dataset used for model-fitting is known informally as interpolation. Prediction outside this range of the data is known as extrapolation. Performing extrapolation relies strongly on the regression assumptions. The further the extrapolation goes outside the data, the more room there is for the model to fail due to differences between the assumptions and the sample data or the true values.\nA prediction interval that represents the uncertainty may accompany the point prediction. Such intervals tend to expand rapidly as the values of the independent variable(s) moved outside the range covered by the observed data.\nFor such reasons and others, some tend to say that it might be unwise to undertake extrapolation.[23]\nModel selection\n[edit]The assumption of a particular form for the relation between Y and X is another source of uncertainty. A properly conducted regression analysis will include an assessment of how well the assumed form is matched by the observed data, but it can only do so within the range of values of the independent variables actually available. This means that any extrapolation is particularly reliant on the assumptions being made about the structural form of the regression relationship. If this knowledge includes the fact that the dependent variable cannot go outside a certain range of values, this can be made use of in selecting the model – even if the observed dataset has no values particularly near such bounds. The implications of this step of choosing an appropriate functional form for the regression can be great when extrapolation is considered. At a minimum, it can ensure that any extrapolation arising from a fitted model is \"realistic\" (or in accord with what is known).\nPower and sample size calculations\n[edit]There are no generally agreed methods for relating the number of observations versus the number of independent variables in the model. One method conjectured by Good and Hardin is , where is the sample size, is the number of independent variables and is the number of observations needed to reach the desired precision if the model had only one independent variable.[24] For example, a researcher is building a linear regression model using a dataset that contains 1000 patients (). If the researcher decides that five observations are needed to precisely define a straight line (), then the maximum number of independent variables () the model can support is 4, because\n- .\nOther methods\n[edit]Although the parameters of a regression model are usually estimated using the method of least squares, other methods which have been used include:\n- Bayesian methods, e.g. Bayesian linear regression\n- Percentage regression, for situations where reducing percentage errors is deemed more appropriate.[25]\n- Least absolute deviations, which is more robust in the presence of outliers, leading to quantile regression\n- Nonparametric regression, requires a large number of observations and is computationally intensive\n- Scenario optimization, leading to interval predictor models\nSoftware\n[edit]All major statistical software packages perform least squares regression analysis and inference. Simple linear regression and multiple regression using least squares can be done in some spreadsheet applications and on some calculators. While many statistical software packages can perform various types of nonparametric and robust regression, these methods are less standardized. Different software packages implement different methods, and a method with a given name may be implemented differently in different packages. Specialized regression software has been developed for use in fields such as survey analysis and neuroimaging.\nSee also\n[edit]- Anscombe's quartet\n- Curve fitting\n- Estimation theory\n- Forecasting\n- Fraction of variance unexplained\n- Function approximation\n- Generalized linear model\n- Kriging (a linear least squares estimation algorithm)\n- Local regression\n- Modifiable areal unit problem\n- Multivariate adaptive regression spline\n- Multivariate normal distribution\n- Pearson correlation coefficient\n- Quasi-variance\n- Prediction interval\n- Regression validation\n- Robust regression\n- Segmented regression\n- Signal processing\n- Stepwise regression\n- Taxicab geometry\n- Linear trend estimation\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ Necessary Condition Analysis\n- ^ David A.

          "content": "What Is Regression?\nRegression is a statistical method that's used in finance, investing, and other disciplines to attempt to determine the strength and character of the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Linear regression is the most common form of this technique. It establishes the linear relationship between two variables and is also referred to as simple regression or ordinary least squares (OLS), linear regression.\nLinear regression is graphically depicted using a straight line of best fit with the slope defining how the change in one variable impacts a change in the other. The y-intercept of a linear regression relationship represents the value of the dependent variable when the value of the independent variable is zero. Nonlinear regression models also exist but are far more complex.\nRegression is used in economics to help investment managers value assets and understand the relationships between factors such as commodity prices and the stocks of businesses dealing in those commodities. It's a powerful tool for uncovering the associations between variables observed in data, but it can't easily indicate causation. Regression as a statistical technique shouldn't be confused with the concept of regression to the mean, also known as mean reversion.\nKey Takeaways\n- Regression is a statistical technique that relates a dependent variable to one or more independent variables.\n- A regression model shows whether changes observed in the dependent variable are associated with changes in one or more of the independent variables.\n- It does this by determining a best-fit line to see how the data is dispersed around this line.\n- Regression helps economists and financial analysts with challenges ranging from asset valuation to making predictions.\n- Several assumptions about the data and the model itself must hold for regression results to be properly interpreted.\nHow Regression Works\nRegression captures the correlation between variables observed in a data set and quantifies whether those correlations are statistically significant. The two basic types of regression are simple linear regression and multiple linear regression but there are nonlinear regression methods for more complicated data and analysis.\nSimple linear regression uses one independent variable to explain or predict the outcome of the dependent variable Y. Multiple linear regression uses two or more independent variables to predict the outcome. Analysts can use stepwise regression to examine each independent variable contained in the linear regression model.\nRegression can help finance and investment professionals. A company might use it to predict sales based on weather, previous sales, gross domestic product (GDP) growth, or other types of conditions. The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is a regression model that's often used in finance for pricing assets and discovering the costs of capital.\nRegression and Econometrics\nEconometrics is a set of statistical techniques that are used to analyze data in finance and economics. It effectively studies the income effect using observable data. An economist might hypothesize that a consumer's spending will increase as they increase their income.\nA regression analysis can then be conducted to understand the strength of the relationship between income and consumption if the data show that such an association is present. It can indicate whether that relationship is statistically significant.\nYou can have several independent variables in an analysis such as changes to GDP and inflation in addition to unemployment in explaining stock market prices. It's referred to as multiple linear regression when more than one independent variable is used. This is the most commonly used tool in econometrics.\nImportant\nEconometrics is sometimes criticized for relying too heavily on the interpretation of regression output without linking it to economic theory or looking for causal mechanisms. It's crucial that the findings revealed in the data can be adequately explained by a theory.\nCalculating Regression\nLinear regression models often use a least-squares approach to determine the line of best fit. The least-squares technique is determined by minimizing the sum of squares created by a mathematical function. A square is then determined by squaring the distance between a data point and the regression line or mean value of the data set.\nA regression model is constructed when this process has been completed. It's usually accomplished with software. The general form of each type of regression model is:\nSimple linear regression:\nY=a+bX+u\nMultiple linear regression:\nY=a+b1X1+b2X2+b3X3+...+btXt+uwhere:Y=The dependent variable you are trying to predictor explainX=The explanatory (independent) variable(s) you are using to predict or associate with Ya=The y-interceptb=(beta coefficient) is the slope of the explanatoryvariable(s)u=The regression residual or error term\nExample of Regression Analysis in Finance\nRegression is often used to determine how specific factors such as the price of a commodity, interest rates, particular industries, or sectors influence the price movement of an asset. The CAPM is based on regression and it's used to project the expected returns for stocks and to generate costs of capital. A stock’s returns are regressed against the returns of a broader index such as the S&P 500 to generate a beta for the particular stock.\nBeta is the stock’s risk in relation to the market or index and it's reflected as the slope in the CAPM. The return for the stock in question would be the dependent variable Y. The independent variable X would be the market risk premium.\nAdditional variables such as the market capitalization of a stock, valuation ratios, and recent returns can be added to the CAPM to get better estimates for returns. These additional factors are known as the Fama-French factors. They're named after the professors who developed the multiple linear regression model to better explain asset returns.\nWhy Is This Method Called Regression?\nThere's some debate about the origins of the name but this statistical technique was most likely termed “regression” by Sir Francis Galton in the 19th century. It described the statistical feature of biological data such as the heights of people in a population to regress to some mean level. There are shorter and taller people but only outliers are very tall or short and most people cluster somewhere around or “regress” to the average.\nWhat Is the Purpose of Regression?\nRegression is used in statistical analysis to identify the associations between variables occurring in some data. It can show the magnitude of such an association and determine its statistical significance. Regression is a powerful tool for statistical inference and has been used to try to predict future outcomes based on past observations.\nHow Do I Interpret a Regression Model?\nA regression model output may be in the form of Y = 1.0 + (3.2)X1 - 2.0(X2) + 0.21.\nHere we have a multiple linear regression that relates some variable Y with two explanatory variables X1 and X2. We would interpret the model as the value of Y changes by 3.2× for every one-unit change in X1. If X1 goes up by 2, Y goes up by 6.4, holding all else constant.\nThis means that when controlling for X2, X1 has this observed relationship. Every one-unit increase in X2 is associated with a 2× decrease in Y if X1 holds constant. We can also note the y-intercept of 1.0, indicating that Y = 1 when X1 and X2 are both zero. The error term or residual is 0.21.\nWhat Are the Assumptions That Must Hold for Regression Models?\nFour main assumptions about the underlying data process of what you're analyzing must hold to properly interpret the output of a regression model:\n- The relationship between variables is linear.\n- There must be homoskedasticity or the variance of the variables and the error term must remain constant.\n- All explanatory variables are independent of each other.\n- All variables are normally distributed.\nThe Bottom Line\nRegression is a statistical method that tries to determine the strength and character of the relationship between one dependent variable and a series of other variables. It's used in finance, investing, and other disciplines.\nRegression analysis uncovers the associations between variables observed in data but it can't easily indicate causation.",

          "content": "Regression (film)\nRegression is a 2015 psychological thriller mystery film directed and written by Alejandro Amenábar. The film stars Ethan Hawke and Emma Watson, with David Thewlis, Lothaire Bluteau, Dale Dickey, David Dencik, Peter MacNeill, Devon Bostick, and Aaron Ashmore in supporting roles.\nThe film had its world premiere at the San Sebastián International Film Festival on September 18, 2015. It was released in the United States on October 9, 2015, by The Weinstein Company under the banner RADiUS-TWC.[4] The film received mostly negative reviews from critics.\nPlot\n[edit]In Hoyer, Minnesota, in 1990, Detective Bruce Kenner investigates the case of John Gray, who admits to sexually abusing his 17-year-old daughter Angela but has no recollection of the abuse. They seek the help of Professor Kenneth Raines to use recovered-memory therapy on John Gray to retrieve his memories, and come to suspect that their colleague Detective George Nesbitt is involved. They detain him but fail to find evidence against him. Detectives suspect a satanic cult is involved because of Angela's testimony, in which Angela says that she was abused by people in masks and someone took pictures of it.\nBruce and Kenneth meet Angela's estranged brother Roy Gray in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to inquire about why he left the house. Using the regression technique on him, he recalls hooded figures entering his room while he was young. Bruce and Kenneth suspect Roy's grandmother, Rose Gray, has some involvement but find nothing after a search of her house.\nMeanwhile, Bruce begins having nightmares involving satanic rituals. Angela tells him that the cult is out to kill her as she has shown her demonic mark to him and that he is in danger as well. She tells him that her mother received miscellaneous calls and saw strange figures staring at her in the street before she herself had an accident. Bruce starts to experience the same things and his nightmares increase in intensity.\nRose jumps from the window of her house after seeing ghostly figures, injuring herself. Bruce meets Angela in the church's cemetery to reassure her and after an emotional outburst, she kisses him. Shocked, Bruce leaves her there and returns to his home. He sees a soup advertisement on the street and recognizes the woman in it as the one he sees in his nightmares. He concludes that his imagination has run away with him. He tells Kenneth that all these past memories are induced by therapy and the whole situation is just the result of mass hysteria. Though the professor is initially resistant to the idea, he too comes to suspect that these memories were not real.\nBruce is attacked by two hooded figures who finally reveal themselves as George and their colleague, Farrell. George was seeking revenge after Bruce detained him as a child molester and ruined his career. Bruce offers to forget the whole situation if George tells him everything he knows. After George reveals things, Bruce confronts Angela about her abuse and she insists she told the truth. Finally Bruce concludes that she was fabricating everything from the beginning as she wanted to escape from her family, whom she believes to be responsible for her mother's death. She wanted to elope with George, as they had a sexual relationship for some time, but he refused to elope with a minor. Angela accused her father in order to escape the house. When Bruce confronts her, she tells him that no one is going to believe him, especially if she tells them that they kissed in the cemetery. Bruce tells John everything but John decides to take the blame and pleads guilty in order to rescue Angela and hopes that she will forgive him one day for being a bad father.\nMany cases like this were reported before the satanic abuse hysteria faded, and that there was never any proof that such ritualistic abuse by organized Satanic cults existed (presumably referring to assertions made during the Satanic panic in the U.S. and other countries in the 1980s and early 1990s).\nCast\n[edit]- Ethan Hawke[5] as Detective Bruce Kenner\n- Emma Watson[6] as Angela Gray\n- David Thewlis as Professor Kenneth Raines\n- Lothaire Bluteau as Reverend Murray\n- Dale Dickey as Rose Gray, Angela's grandmother.\n- David Dencik[7] as John Gray, Angela's father.\n- Peter MacNeill as Police Chief Cleveland\n- Devon Bostick[8] as Roy Gray, Angela's brother.\n- Aaron Ashmore as Detective George Nesbitt\n- Adam Butcher as Brody\n- Kristian Bruun as Andrew\n- Aaron Abrams as Farrell\n- Julian Richings as Tom\n- Wendy Lyon as Norma\n- Janet Porter as S.

On February 5, 2014, Emma Watson joined the film to star with Hawke,[6] and on March 25, David Dencik was added to the cast, playing a man who is arrested in a Minnesota town for allegedly sexually abusing his daughter.[7] On May 23, Devon Bostick was added to the cast of the film.[8]\nAlejandro Amenábar directed his own script, while FilmNation Entertainment holds international rights.[5]\nFilming\n[edit]Principal photography began on April 15, 2014, in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. Emma Watson stated, \"First day shooting Regression today – a very cool birthday present xx.\"[9] On the day, which was her 24th birthday, she filmed a church scene at the University of Toronto Mississauga.[10] Shooting was taking place in Tottenham on May 5. On June 3, it was reported that Watson was back in Toronto to continue the rest of filming after spending some time in the UK and graduating from Brown.[11] Principal photography concluded June 12.[12] On January 28, 2015, the crew filmed several additional scenes or reshoots in Mississauga.[13]\nMarketing\n[edit]On June 10, 2014, TWC-Dimension revealed a first look photo from the film.[14] On February 12, 2015, the first trailer was released,[15] and on February 1, 2016, the U.S. trailer premiered.[16]\nRelease\n[edit]In November 2013, TWC-Dimension acquired US distribution rights to the film.[17] The film had its world premiere at the San Sebastián International Film Festival on September 18, 2015.[4] It was released in Spain on October 2, 2015 and in the United Kingdom on October 9, 2015.[18]\nRegression was originally set for an August 28, 2015 release in the U.S., but was pulled from the schedule.[19][20] It was then pushed back to its eventual U.S. theatrical date of February 5, 2016,[21][22] and was released on Amazon Instant Video thirty days later.[2]\nReception\n[edit]Regression received generally negative reviews from critics upon release, with criticism focused on the film's third act. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 14% rating, based on 42 reviews, leaving a rating average of 4.1/10. The site's consensus reads, \"Regression boasts a pair of eminently likable leads – neither of whom are able to dislodge the movie from the mire of psychological thriller mediocrity.\"[23] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 32 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".[24]\nThe film opened at the box office, grossing just $55,039 in its domestic run in theaters.[25] The film would eventually gross 17.7 million USD worldwide, on a budget of 15 million USD. Mark Kermode, of The Guardian, wrote that the film was \"largely forgettable fare, but at least its unhysterical heart is in the right place.\"[26]\nDespite a disappointing domestic run at the box office, the film was number one at the weekend box office in Spain from October 4 to the October 11, 2015. In 2015, Regression had the highest opening-weekend gross at the Spanish box office for any homegrown film, earning $2.87 million (€2.55 million).[27] The film garnered 40 percent of the Spanish box office on 370 screens.[27]\nSee also\n[edit]References\n[edit]- ^ \"REGRESSION (15)\".

          "description": "In statistics, linear regression is a model that estimates the relationship between a scalar response (dependent variable) and one or more explanatory ...",
          "content": "Linear regression\nIn statistics, linear regression is a model that estimates the relationship between a scalar response (dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (regressor or independent variable). A model with exactly one explanatory variable is a simple linear regression; a model with two or more explanatory variables is a multiple linear regression.[1] This term is distinct from multivariate linear regression, which predicts multiple correlated dependent variables rather than a single dependent variable.[2]\nIn linear regression, the relationships are modeled using linear predictor functions whose unknown model parameters are estimated from the data. Most commonly, the conditional mean of the response given the values of the explanatory variables (or predictors) is assumed to be an affine function of those values; less commonly, the conditional median or some other quantile is used. Like all forms of regression analysis, linear regression focuses on the conditional probability distribution of the response given the values of the predictors, rather than on the joint probability distribution of all of these variables, which is the domain of multivariate analysis.\nLinear regression is also a type of machine learning algorithm, more specifically a supervised algorithm, that learns from the labelled datasets and maps the data points to the most optimized linear functions that can be used for prediction on new datasets.[3]\nLinear regression was the first type of regression analysis to be studied rigorously, and to be used extensively in practical applications.[4] This is because models which depend linearly on their unknown parameters are easier to fit than models which are non-linearly related to their parameters and because the statistical properties of the resulting estimators are easier to determine.\nLinear regression has many practical uses. Most applications fall into one of the following two broad categories:\n- If the goal is error i.e. variance reduction in prediction or forecasting, linear regression can be used to fit a predictive model to an observed data set of values of the response and explanatory variables. After developing such a model, if additional values of the explanatory variables are collected without an accompanying response value, the fitted model can be used to make a prediction of the response.\n- If the goal is to explain variation in the response variable that can be attributed to variation in the explanatory variables, linear regression analysis can be applied to quantify the strength of the relationship between the response and the explanatory variables, and in particular to determine whether some explanatory variables may have no linear relationship with the response at all, or to identify which subsets of explanatory variables may contain redundant information about the response.\nLinear regression models are often fitted using the least squares approach, but they may also be fitted in other ways, such as by minimizing the \"lack of fit\" in some other norm (as with least absolute deviations regression), or by minimizing a penalized version of the least squares cost function as in ridge regression (L2-norm penalty) and lasso (L1-norm penalty). Use of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the cost on a dataset that has many large outliers, can result in a model that fits the outliers more than the true data due to the higher importance assigned by MSE to large errors. So, cost functions that are robust to outliers should be used if the dataset has many large outliers. Conversely, the least squares approach can be used to fit models that are not linear models. Thus, although the terms \"least squares\" and \"linear model\" are closely linked, they are not synonymous.\nFormulation\n[edit]Given a data set of n statistical units, a linear regression model assumes that the relationship between the dependent variable y and the vector of regressors x is linear. This relationship is modeled through a disturbance term or error variable ε—an unobserved random variable that adds \"noise\" to the linear relationship between the dependent variable and regressors. Thus the model takes the formwhere T denotes the transpose, so that xiTβ is the inner product between vectors xi and β.\nOften these n equations are stacked together and written in matrix notation as\nwhere\nNotation and terminology\n[edit]- is a vector of observed values of the variable called the regressand, endogenous variable, response variable, target variable, measured variable, criterion variable, or dependent variable. This variable is also sometimes known as the predicted variable, but this should not be confused with predicted values, which are denoted . The decision as to which variable in a data set is modeled as the dependent variable and which are modeled as the independent variables may be based on a presumption that the value of one of the variables is caused by, or directly influenced by the other variables. Alternatively, there may be an operational reason to model one of the variables in terms of the others, in which case there need be no presumption of causality.\n- may be seen as a matrix of row-vectors or of n-dimensional column-vectors , which are known as regressors, exogenous variables, explanatory variables, covariates, input variables, predictor variables, or independent variables (not to be confused with the concept of independent random variables). The matrix is sometimes called the design matrix.\n- Usually a constant is included as one of the regressors. In particular, for . The corresponding element of β is called the intercept. Many statistical inference procedures for linear models require an intercept to be present, so it is often included even if theoretical considerations suggest that its value should be zero.\n- Sometimes one of the regressors can be a non-linear function of another regressor or of the data values, as in polynomial regression and segmented regression. The model remains linear as long as it is linear in the parameter vector β.\n- The values xij may be viewed as either observed values of random variables Xj or as fixed values chosen prior to observing the dependent variable. Both interpretations may be appropriate in different cases, and they generally lead to the same estimation procedures; however different approaches to asymptotic analysis are used in these two situations.\n- is a -dimensional parameter vector, where is the intercept term (if one is included in the model—otherwise is p-dimensional). Its elements are known as effects or regression coefficients (although the latter term is sometimes reserved for the estimated effects). In simple linear regression, p=1, and the coefficient is known as regression slope. Statistical estimation and inference in linear regression focuses on β. The elements of this parameter vector are interpreted as the partial derivatives of the dependent variable with respect to the various independent variables.\n- is a vector of values . This part of the model is called the error term, disturbance term, or sometimes noise (in contrast with the \"signal\" provided by the rest of the model). This variable captures all other factors which influence the dependent variable y other than the regressors x. The relationship between the error term and the regressors, for example their correlation, is a crucial consideration in formulating a linear regression model, as it will determine the appropriate estimation method.\nFitting a linear model to a given data set usually requires estimating the regression coefficients such that the error term is minimized. For example, it is common to use the sum of squared errors as a measure of for minimization.\nExample\n[edit]Consider a situation where a small ball is being tossed up in the air and then we measure its heights of ascent hi at various moments in time ti. Physics tells us that, ignoring the drag, the relationship can be modeled as\nwhere β1 determines the initial velocity of the ball, β2 is proportional to the standard gravity, and εi is due to measurement errors. Linear regression can be used to estimate the values of β1 and β2 from the measured data. This model is non-linear in the time variable, but it is linear in the parameters β1 and β2; if we take regressors xi = (xi1, xi2) = (ti, ti2), the model takes on the standard form\nAssumptions\n[edit]Standard linear regression models with standard estimation techniques make a number of assumptions about the predictor variables, the response variable and their relationship. Numerous extensions have been developed that allow each of these assumptions to be relaxed (i.e. reduced to a weaker form), and in some cases eliminated entirely. Generally these extensions make the estimation procedure more complex and time-consuming, and may also require more data in order to produce an equally precise model.[citation needed]\nThe following are the major assumptions made by standard linear regression models with standard estimation techniques (e.g. ordinary least squares):\n- Weak exogeneity. This essentially means that the predictor variables x can be treated as fixed values, rather than random variables. This means, for example, that the predictor variables are assumed to be error-free—that is, not contaminated with measurement errors. Although this assumption is not realistic in many settings, dropping it leads to significantly more difficult errors-in-variables models.\n- Linearity. This means that the mean of the response variable is a linear combination of the parameters (regression coefficients) and the predictor variables. Note that this assumption is much less restrictive than it may at first seem. Because the predictor variables are treated as fixed values (see above), linearity is really only a restriction on the parameters. The predictor variables themselves can be arbitrarily transformed, and in fact multiple copies of the same underlying predictor variable can be added, each one transformed differently. This technique is used, for example, in polynomial regression, which uses linear regression to fit the response variable as an arbitrary polynomial function (up to a given degree) of a predictor variable. With this much flexibility, models such as polynomial regression often have \"too much power\", in that they tend to overfit the data. As a result, some kind of regularization must typically be used to prevent unreasonable solutions coming out of the estimation process. Common examples are ridge regression and lasso regression. Bayesian linear regression can also be used, which by its nature is more or less immune to the problem of overfitting. (In fact, ridge regression and lasso regression can both be viewed as special cases of Bayesian linear regression, with particular types of prior distributions placed on the regression coefficients.)\n- Constant variance (a.k.a. homoscedasticity). This means that the variance of the errors does not depend on the values of the predictor variables. Thus the variability of the responses for given fixed values of the predictors is the same regardless of how large or small the responses are. This is often not the case, as a variable whose mean is large will typically have a greater variance than one whose mean is small. For example, a person whose income is predicted to be $100,000 may easily have an actual income of $80,000 or $120,000—i.e., a standard deviation of around $20,000—while another person with a predicted income of $10,000 is unlikely to have the same $20,000 standard deviation, since that would imply their actual income could vary anywhere between −$10,000 and $30,000. (In fact, as this shows, in many cases—often the same cases where the assumption of normally distributed errors fails—the variance or standard deviation should be predicted to be proportional to the mean, rather than constant.) The absence of homoscedasticity is called heteroscedasticity. In order to check this assumption, a plot of residuals versus predicted values (or the values of each individual predictor) can be examined for a \"fanning effect\" (i.e., increasing or decreasing vertical spread as one moves left to right on the plot). A plot of the absolute or squared residuals versus the predicted values (or each predictor) can also be examined for a trend or curvature. Formal tests can also be used; see Heteroscedasticity. The presence of heteroscedasticity will result in an overall \"average\" estimate of variance being used instead of one that takes into account the true variance structure. This leads to less precise (but in the case of ordinary least squares, not biased) parameter estimates and biased standard errors, resulting in misleading tests and interval estimates. The mean squared error for the model will also be wrong. Various estimation techniques including weighted least squares and the use of heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors can handle heteroscedasticity in a quite general way. Bayesian linear regression techniques can also be used when the variance is assumed to be a function of the mean. It is also possible in some cases to fix the problem by applying a transformation to the response variable (e.g., fitting the logarithm of the response variable using a linear regression model, which implies that the response variable itself has a log-normal distribution rather than a normal distribution).\n- Independence of errors. This assumes that the errors of the response variables are uncorrelated with each other. (Actual statistical independence is a stronger condition than mere lack of correlation and is often not needed, although it can be exploited if it is known to hold.) Some methods such as generalized least squares are capable of handling correlated errors, although they typically require significantly more data unless some sort of regularization is used to bias the model towards assuming uncorrelated errors. Bayesian linear regression is a general way of handling this issue.\n- Lack of perfect multicollinearity in the predictors. For standard least squares estimation methods, the design matrix X must have full column rank p; otherwise perfect multicollinearity exists in the predictor variables, meaning a linear relationship exists between two or more predictor variables. This can be caused by accidentally duplicating a variable in the data, using a linear transformation of a variable along with the original (e.g., the same temperature measurements expressed in Fahrenheit and Celsius), or including a linear combination of multiple variables in the model, such as their mean. It can also happen if there is too little data available compared to the number of parameters to be estimated (e.g., fewer data points than regression coefficients). Near violations of this assumption, where predictors are highly but not perfectly correlated, can reduce the precision of parameter estimates (see Variance inflation factor). In the case of perfect multicollinearity, the parameter vector β will be non-identifiable—it has no unique solution. In such a case, only some of the parameters can be identified (i.e., their values can only be estimated within some linear subspace of the full parameter space Rp). See partial least squares regression. Methods for fitting linear models with multicollinearity have been developed,[5][6][7][8] some of which require additional assumptions such as \"effect sparsity\"—that a large fraction of the effects are exactly zero. Note that the more computationally expensive iterated algorithms for parameter estimation, such as those used in generalized linear models, do not suffer from this problem.\nViolations of these assumptions can result in biased estimations of β, biased standard errors, untrustworthy confidence intervals and significance tests. Beyond these assumptions, several other statistical properties of the data strongly influence the performance of different estimation methods:\n- The statistical relationship between the error terms and the regressors plays an important role in determining whether an estimation procedure has desirable sampling properties such as being unbiased and consistent.\n- The arrangement, or probability distribution of the predictor variables x has a major influence on the precision of estimates of β. Sampling and design of experiments are highly developed subfields of statistics that provide guidance for collecting data in such a way to achieve a precise estimate of β.\nInterpretation\n[edit]A fitted linear regression model can be used to identify the relationship between a single predictor variable xj and the response variable y when all the other predictor variables in the model are \"held fixed\". Specifically, the interpretation of βj is the expected change in y for a one-unit change in xj when the other covariates are held fixed—that is, the expected value of the partial derivative of y with respect to xj. This is sometimes called the unique effect of xj on y. In contrast, the marginal effect of xj on y can be assessed using a correlation coefficient or simple linear regression model relating only xj to y; this effect is the total derivative of y with respect to xj.\nCare must be taken when interpreting regression results, as some of the regressors may not allow for marginal changes (such as dummy variables, or the intercept term), while others cannot be held fixed (recall the example from the introduction: it would be impossible to \"hold ti fixed\" and at the same time change the value of ti2).\nIt is possible that the unique effect be nearly zero even when the marginal effect is large. This may imply that some other covariate captures all the information in xj, so that once that variable is in the model, there is no contribution of xj to the variation in y. Conversely, the unique effect of xj can be large while its marginal effect is nearly zero. This would happen if the other covariates explained a great deal of the variation of y, but they mainly explain variation in a way that is complementary to what is captured by xj. In this case, including the other variables in the model reduces the part of the variability of y that is unrelated to xj, thereby strengthening the apparent relationship with xj.\nThe meaning of the expression \"held fixed\" may depend on how the values of the predictor variables arise. If the experimenter directly sets the values of the predictor variables according to a study design, the comparisons of interest may literally correspond to comparisons among units whose predictor variables have been \"held fixed\" by the experimenter. Alternatively, the expression \"held fixed\" can refer to a selection that takes place in the context of data analysis. In this case, we \"hold a variable fixed\" by restricting our attention to the subsets of the data that happen to have a common value for the given predictor variable. This is the only interpretation of \"held fixed\" that can be used in an observational study.\nThe notion of a \"unique effect\" is appealing when studying a complex system where multiple interrelated components influence the response variable. In some cases, it can literally be interpreted as the causal effect of an intervention that is linked to the value of a predictor variable. However, it has been argued that in many cases multiple regression analysis fails to clarify the relationships between the predictor variables and the response variable when the predictors are correlated with each other and are not assigned following a study design.[9]\nExtensions\n[edit]Numerous extensions of linear regression have been developed, which allow some or all of the assumptions underlying the basic model to be relaxed.\nSimple and multiple linear regression\n[edit]The simplest case of a single scalar predictor variable x and a single scalar response variable y is known as simple linear regression. The extension to multiple and/or vector-valued predictor variables (denoted with a capital X) is known as multiple linear regression, also known as multivariable linear regression (not to be confused with multivariate linear regression).[10]\nMultiple linear regression is a generalization of simple linear regression to the case of more than one independent variable, and a special case of general linear models, restricted to one dependent variable. The basic model for multiple linear regression is\nfor each observation .\nIn the formula above we consider n observations of one dependent variable and p independent variables. Thus, Yi is the ith observation of the dependent variable, Xij is ith observation of the jth independent variable, j = 1, 2, ..., p. The values βj represent parameters to be estimated, and εi is the ith independent identically distributed normal error.\nIn the more general multivariate linear regression, there is one equation of the above form for each of m > 1 dependent variables that share the same set of explanatory variables and hence are estimated simultaneously with each other:\nfor all observations indexed as i = 1, ... , n and for all dependent variables indexed as j = 1, ... , m.\nNearly all real-world regression models involve multiple predictors, and basic descriptions of linear regression are often phrased in terms of the multiple regression model. Note, however, that in these cases the response variable y is still a scalar. Another term, multivariate linear regression, refers to cases where y is a vector, i.e., the same as general linear regression.\nModel Assumptions to Check: 1. Linearity: Relationship between each predictor and outcome must be linear 2. Normality of residuals: Residuals should follow a normal distribution 3. Homoscedasticity: Constant variance of residuals across predicted values 4. Independence: Observations should be independent (not repeated measures) SPSS: Use partial plots, histograms, P-P plots, residual vs. predicted plots\nGeneral linear models\n[edit]The general linear model considers the situation when the response variable is not a scalar (for each observation) but a vector, yi. Conditional linearity of is still assumed, with a matrix B replacing the vector β of the classical linear regression model. Multivariate analogues of ordinary least squares (OLS) and generalized least squares (GLS) have been developed. \"General linear models\" are also called \"multivariate linear models\". These are not the same as multivariable linear models (also called \"multiple linear models\").\nHeteroscedastic models\n[edit]Various models have been created that allow for heteroscedasticity, i.e. the errors for different response variables may have different variances. For example, weighted least squares is a method for estimating linear regression models when the response variables may have different error variances, possibly with correlated errors. (See also Weighted linear least squares, and Generalized least squares.) Heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors is an improved method for use with uncorrelated but potentially heteroscedastic errors.\nGeneralized linear models\n[edit]The Generalized linear model (GLM) is a framework for modeling response variables that are bounded or discrete. This is used, for example:\n- when modeling positive quantities (e.g. prices or populations) that vary over a large scale—which are better described using a skewed distribution such as the log-normal distribution or Poisson distribution (although GLMs are not used for log-normal data, instead the response variable is simply transformed using the logarithm function);\n- when modeling categorical data, such as the choice of a given candidate in an election (which is better described using a Bernoulli distribution/binomial distribution for binary choices, or a categorical distribution/multinomial distribution for multi-way choices), where there are a fixed number of choices that cannot be meaningfully ordered;\n- when modeling ordinal data, e.g. ratings on a scale from 0 to 5, where the different outcomes can be ordered but where the quantity itself may not have any absolute meaning (e.g. a rating of 4 may not be \"twice as good\" in any objective sense as a rating of 2, but simply indicates that it is better than 2 or 3 but not as good as 5).\nGeneralized linear models allow for an arbitrary link function, g, that relates the mean of the response variable(s) to the predictors: . The link function is often related to the distribution of the response, and in particular it typically has the effect of transforming between the range of the linear predictor and the range of the response variable.\nSome common examples of GLMs are:\n- Poisson regression for count data.\n- Logistic regression and probit regression for binary data.\n- Multinomial logistic regression and multinomial probit regression for categorical data.\n- Ordered logit and ordered probit regression for ordinal data.\nSingle index models[clarification needed] allow some degree of nonlinearity in the relationship between x and y, while preserving the central role of the linear predictor β′x as in the classical linear regression model. Under certain conditions, simply applying OLS to data from a single-index model will consistently estimate β up to a proportionality constant.[11]\nHierarchical linear models\n[edit]Hierarchical linear models (or multilevel regression) organizes the data into a hierarchy of regressions, for example where A is regressed on B, and B is regressed on C. It is often used where the variables of interest have a natural hierarchical structure such as in educational statistics, where students are nested in classrooms, classrooms are nested in schools, and schools are nested in some administrative grouping, such as a school district. The response variable might be a measure of student achievement such as a test score, and different covariates would be collected at the classroom, school, and school district levels.\nErrors-in-variables\n[edit]Errors-in-variables models (or \"measurement error models\") extend the traditional linear regression model to allow the predictor variables X to be observed with error. This error causes standard estimators of β to become biased. Generally, the form of bias is an attenuation, meaning that the effects are biased toward zero.\nGroup effects\n[edit]In a multiple linear regression model\nparameter of predictor variable represents the individual effect of . It has an interpretation as the expected change in the response variable when increases by one unit with other predictor variables held constant. When is strongly correlated with other predictor variables, it is improbable that can increase by one unit with other variables held constant. In this case, the interpretation of becomes problematic as it is based on an improbable condition, and the effect of cannot be evaluated in isolation.\nFor a group of predictor variables, say, , a group effect is defined as a linear combination of their parameters\nwhere is a weight vector satisfying . Because of the constraint on , is also referred to as a normalized group effect. A group effect has an interpretation as the expected change in when variables in the group change by the amount , respectively, at the same time with other variables (not in the group) held constant. It generalizes the individual effect of a variable to a group of variables in that () if , then the group effect reduces to an individual effect, and () if and for , then the group effect also reduces to an individual effect. A group effect is said to be meaningful if the underlying simultaneous changes of the variables is probable.\nGroup effects provide a means to study the collective impact of strongly correlated predictor variables in linear regression models. Individual effects of such variables are not well-defined as their parameters do not have good interpretations. Furthermore, when the sample size is not large, none of their parameters can be accurately estimated by the least squares regression due to the multicollinearity problem. Nevertheless, there are meaningful group effects that have good interpretations and can be accurately estimated by the least squares regression. A simple way to identify these meaningful group effects is to use an all positive correlations (APC) arrangement of the strongly correlated variables under which pairwise correlations among these variables are all positive, and standardize all predictor variables in the model so that they all have mean zero and length one. To illustrate this, suppose that is a group of strongly correlated variables in an APC arrangement and that they are not strongly correlated with predictor variables outside the group. Let be the centred and be the standardized . Then, the standardized linear regression model is\nParameters in the original model, including , are simple functions of in the standardized model. The standardization of variables does not change their correlations, so is a group of strongly correlated variables in an APC arrangement and they are not strongly correlated with other predictor variables in the standardized model. A group effect of is\nand its minimum-variance unbiased linear estimator is\nwhere is the least squares estimator of . In particular, the average group effect of the standardized variables is\nwhich has an interpretation as the expected change in when all in the strongly correlated group increase by th of a unit at the same time with variables outside the group held constant. With strong positive correlations and in standardized units, variables in the group are approximately equal, so they are likely to increase at the same time and in similar amount. Thus, the average group effect is a meaningful effect. It can be accurately estimated by its minimum-variance unbiased linear estimator , even when individually none of the can be accurately estimated by .\nNot all group effects are meaningful or can be accurately estimated. For example, is a special group effect with weights and for , but it cannot be accurately estimated by . It is also not a meaningful effect. In general, for a group of strongly correlated predictor variables in an APC arrangement in the standardized model, group effects whose weight vectors are at or near the centre of the simplex () are meaningful and can be accurately estimated by their minimum-variance unbiased linear estimators. Effects with weight vectors far away from the centre are not meaningful as such weight vectors represent simultaneous changes of the variables that violate the strong positive correlations of the standardized variables in an APC arrangement. As such, they are not probable. These effects also cannot be accurately estimated.\nApplications of the group effects include (1) estimation and inference for meaningful group effects on the response variable, (2) testing for \"group significance\" of the variables via testing versus , and (3) characterizing the region of the predictor variable space over which predictions by the least squares estimated model are accurate.\nA group effect of the original variables can be expressed as a constant times a group effect of the standardized variables . The former is meaningful when the latter is. Thus meaningful group effects of the original variables can be found through meaningful group effects of the standardized variables.[12]\nOthers\n[edit]In Dempster–Shafer theory, or a linear belief function in particular, a linear regression model may be represented as a partially swept matrix, which can be combined with similar matrices representing observations and other assumed normal distributions and state equations. The combination of swept or unswept matrices provides an alternative method for estimating linear regression models.\nEstimation methods\n[edit]A large number of procedures have been developed for parameter estimation and inference in linear regression. These methods differ in computational simplicity of algorithms, presence of a closed-form solution, robustness with respect to heavy-tailed distributions, and theoretical assumptions needed to validate desirable statistical properties such as consistency and asymptotic efficiency.\nSome of the more common estimation techniques for linear regression are summarized below.\nLeast-squares estimation and related techniques\n[edit]Assuming that the independent variables are and the model's parameters are , then the model's prediction would be\n- .\nIf is extended to then would become a dot product of the parameter and the independent vectors, i.e.\n- .\nIn the least-squares setting, the optimum parameter vector is defined as such that minimizes the sum of mean squared loss:\nNow putting the independent and dependent variables in matrices and respectively, the loss function can be rewritten as:\nAs the loss function is convex, the optimum solution lies at gradient zero. The gradient of the loss function is (using Denominator layout convention):\nSetting the gradient to zero produces the optimum parameter:\nNote: The obtained may indeed be the local minimum, one needs to differentiate once more to obtain the Hessian matrix and show that it is positive definite. This is provided by the Gauss–Markov theorem.\nLinear least squares methods include mainly:\nMaximum-likelihood estimation and related techniques\n[edit]Maximum likelihood estimation\n[edit]Maximum likelihood estimation can be performed when the distribution of the error terms is known to belong to a certain parametric family ƒθ of probability distributions.[15] When fθ is a normal distribution with zero mean and variance θ, the resulting estimate is identical to the OLS estimate. GLS estimates are maximum likelihood estimates when ε follows a multivariate normal distribution with a known covariance matrix. Let's denote each data point by and the regression parameters as , and the set of all data by and the cost function by .\nAs shown below the same optimal parameter that minimizes achieves maximum likelihood too.[16] Here the assumption is that the dependent variable is a random variable that follows a Gaussian distribution, where the standard deviation is fixed and the mean is a linear combination of :\nNow, we need to look for a parameter that maximizes this likelihood function. Since the logarithmic function is strictly increasing, instead of maximizing this function, we can also maximize its logarithm and find the optimal parameter that way.[16]\nThe optimal parameter is thus equal to:[16]\nIn this way, the parameter that maximizes is the same as the one that minimizes . This means that in linear regression, the result of the least squares method is the same as the result of the maximum likelihood estimation method.[16]\nRegularized Regression\n[edit]Ridge regression[17][18][19] and other forms of penalized estimation, such as Lasso regression,[5] deliberately introduce bias into the estimation of β in order to reduce the variability of the estimate. The resulting estimates generally have lower mean squared error than the OLS estimates, particularly when multicollinearity is present or when overfitting is a problem. They are generally used when the goal is to predict the value of the response variable y for values of the predictors x that have not yet been observed. These methods are not as commonly used when the goal is inference, since it is difficult to account for the bias.\nLeast Absolute Deviation\n[edit]Least absolute deviation (LAD) regression is a robust estimation technique in that it is less sensitive to the presence of outliers than OLS (but is less efficient than OLS when no outliers are present). It is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation under a Laplace distribution model for ε.[20]\nAdaptive Estimation\n[edit]If we assume that error terms are independent of the regressors, , then the optimal estimator is the 2-step MLE, where the first step is used to non-parametrically estimate the distribution of the error term.[21]\nOther estimation techniques\n[edit]- Bayesian linear regression applies the framework of Bayesian statistics to linear regression. (See also Bayesian multivariate linear regression.) In particular, the regression coefficients β are assumed to be random variables with a specified prior distribution. The prior distribution can bias the solutions for the regression coefficients, in a way similar to (but more general than) ridge regression or lasso regression. In addition, the Bayesian estimation process produces not a single point estimate for the \"best\" values of the regression coefficients but an entire posterior distribution, completely describing the uncertainty surrounding the quantity. This can be used to estimate the \"best\" coefficients using the mean, mode, median, any quantile (see quantile regression), or any other function of the posterior distribution.\n- Quantile regression focuses on the conditional quantiles of y given X rather than the conditional mean of y given X. Linear quantile regression models a particular conditional quantile, for example the conditional median, as a linear function βTx of the predictors.\n- Mixed models are widely used to analyze linear regression relationships involving dependent data when the dependencies have a known structure. Common applications of mixed models include analysis of data involving repeated measurements, such as longitudinal data, or data obtained from cluster sampling. They are generally fit as parametric models, using maximum likelihood or Bayesian estimation. In the case where the errors are modeled as normal random variables, there is a close connection between mixed models and generalized least squares.[22] Fixed effects estimation is an alternative approach to analyzing this type of data.\n- Principal component regression (PCR)[7][8] is used when the number of predictor variables is large, or when strong correlations exist among the predictor variables. This two-stage procedure first reduces the predictor variables using principal component analysis, and then uses the reduced variables in an OLS regression fit. While it often works well in practice, there is no general theoretical reason that the most informative linear function of the predictor variables should lie among the dominant principal components of the multivariate distribution of the predictor variables. The partial least squares regression is the extension of the PCR method which does not suffer from the mentioned deficiency.\n- Least-angle regression[6] is an estimation procedure for linear regression models that was developed to handle high-dimensional covariate vectors, potentially with more covariates than observations.\n- The Theil–Sen estimator is a simple robust estimation technique that chooses the slope of the fit line to be the median of the slopes of the lines through pairs of sample points. It has similar statistical efficiency properties to simple linear regression but is much less sensitive to outliers.[23]\n- Other robust estimation techniques, including the α-trimmed mean approach, and L-, M-, S-, and R-estimators have been introduced.\nApplications\n[edit]Linear regression is widely used in biological, behavioral and social sciences to describe possible relationships between variables. It ranks as one of the most important tools used in these disciplines.\nTrend line\n[edit]A trend line represents a trend, the long-term movement in time series data after other components have been accounted for. It tells whether a particular data set (say GDP, oil prices or stock prices) have increased or decreased over the period of time. A trend line could simply be drawn by eye through a set of data points, but more properly their position and slope is calculated using statistical techniques like linear regression. Trend lines typically are straight lines, although some variations use higher degree polynomials depending on the degree of curvature desired in the line.\nTrend lines are sometimes used in business analytics to show changes in data over time. This has the advantage of being simple. Trend lines are often used to argue that a particular action or event (such as training, or an advertising campaign) caused observed changes at a point in time. This is a simple technique, and does not require a control group, experimental design, or a sophisticated analysis technique. However, it suffers from a lack of scientific validity in cases where other potential changes can affect the data.\nEpidemiology\n[edit]Early evidence relating tobacco smoking to mortality and morbidity came from observational studies employing regression analysis. In order to reduce spurious correlations when analyzing observational data, researchers usually include several variables in their regression models in addition to the variable of primary interest. For example, in a regression model in which cigarette smoking is the independent variable of primary interest and the dependent variable is lifespan measured in years, researchers might include education and income as additional independent variables, to ensure that any observed effect of smoking on lifespan is not due to those other socio-economic factors. However, it is never possible to include all possible confounding variables in an empirical analysis. For example, a hypothetical gene might increase mortality and also cause people to smoke more. For this reason, randomized controlled trials are often able to generate more compelling evidence of causal relationships than can be obtained using regression analyses of observational data. When controlled experiments are not feasible, variants of regression analysis such as instrumental variables regression may be used to attempt to estimate causal relationships from observational data.\nFinance\n[edit]The capital asset pricing model uses linear regression as well as the concept of beta for analyzing and quantifying the systematic risk of an investment. This comes directly from the beta coefficient of the linear regression model that relates the return on the investment to the return on all risky assets.\nEconomics\n[edit]Linear regression is the predominant empirical tool in economics. For example, it is used to predict consumption spending,[24] fixed investment spending, inventory investment, purchases of a country's exports,[25] spending on imports,[25] the demand to hold liquid assets,[26] labor demand,[27] and labor supply.[27]\nEnvironmental science\n[edit]Linear regression finds application in a wide range of environmental science applications such as land use,[28] infectious diseases,[29] and air pollution.[30] For example, linear regression can be used to predict the changing effects of car pollution.[31] One notable example of this application in infectious diseases is the flattening the curve strategy emphasized early in the COVID-19 pandemic, where public health officials dealt with sparse data on infected individuals and sophisticated models of disease transmission to characterize the spread of COVID-19.[32]\nBuilding science\n[edit]Linear regression is commonly used in building science field studies to derive characteristics of building occupants. In a thermal comfort field study, building scientists usually ask occupants' thermal sensation votes, which range from -3 (feeling cold) to 0 (neutral) to +3 (feeling hot), and measure occupants' surrounding temperature data. A neutral or comfort temperature can be calculated based on a linear regression between the thermal sensation vote and indoor temperature, and setting the thermal sensation vote as zero. However, there has been a debate on the regression direction: regressing thermal sensation votes (y-axis) against indoor temperature (x-axis) or the opposite: regressing indoor temperature (y-axis) against thermal sensation votes (x-axis).[33]\nMachine learning\n[edit]Linear regression plays an important role in the subfield of artificial intelligence known as machine learning. The linear regression algorithm is one of the fundamental supervised machine-learning algorithms due to its relative simplicity and well-known properties.[34]\nHistory\n[edit]Isaac Newton is credited with inventing \"a certain technique known today as linear regression analysis\" in his work on equinoxes in 1700, and wrote down the first of the two normal equations of the ordinary least squares method.[35][36] The Least squares linear regression, as a means of finding a good rough linear fit to a set of points was performed by Legendre (1805) and Gauss (1809) for the prediction of planetary movement. Quetelet was responsible for making the procedure well-known and for using it extensively in the social sciences.[37]\nSee also\n[edit]- Analysis of variance\n- Blinder–Oaxaca decomposition\n- Censored regression model\n- Cross-sectional regression\n- Curve fitting\n- Empirical Bayes method\n- Errors and residuals\n- Lack-of-fit sum of squares\n- Line fitting\n- Linear classifier\n- Linear equation\n- Logistic regression\n- M-estimator\n- Multivariate adaptive regression spline\n- Nonlinear regression\n- Nonparametric regression\n- Normal equations\n- Projection pursuit regression\n- Response modeling methodology\n- Segmented linear regression\n- Standard deviation line\n- Stepwise regression\n- Structural break\n- Support vector machine\n- Truncated regression model\n- Deming regression\nReferences\n[edit]Citations\n[edit]- ^ Freedman, David A.

          "content": "Regression (psychology)\nIn psychoanalytic theory, regression is a defense mechanism involving the reversion of the ego to an earlier stage of psychosexual development, as a reaction to an overwhelming external problem or internal conflict.[1]\nSigmund Freud invoked the notion of regression in relation to his theory of dreams (1900) and sexual perversions (1905), but the concept itself was first elaborated in his paper \"The Disposition to Obsessional Neurosis\" (1913). In 1914, he added a paragraph to The Interpretation of Dreams that distinguished three kinds of regression, which he called topographical regression, temporal regression, and formal regression.[2][3]\nFreud, regression, and neurosis\n[edit]Freud saw inhibited development, fixation, and regression as centrally formative elements in the creation of a neurosis. Arguing that \"the libidinal function goes through a lengthy development\", he assumed that \"a development of this kind involves two dangers – first, of inhibition, and secondly, of regression\".[4] Inhibitions produced fixations, and the \"stronger the fixations on its path of development, the more readily will the function evade external difficulties by regressing to the fixations\".[5]\nNeurosis for Freud was thus the product of a flight from an unsatisfactory reality \"along the path of involution, of regression, of a return to earlier phases of sexual life, phases from which at one time satisfaction was not withheld. This regression appears to be a twofold one: a temporal one, in so far as the libido, the erotic needs, hark back to stages of development that are earlier in time, and a formal one, in that the original and primitive methods of psychic expression are employed in manifesting those needs\".[6][7]\nBehaviors associated with regression can vary greatly depending upon the stage of fixation: one at the oral stage might result in excessive eating or smoking, or verbal aggression, whereas one at the anal stage might result in excessive tidiness or messiness. Freud recognised that \"it is possible for several fixations to be left behind in the course of development, and each of these may allow an irruption of the libido that has been pushed off – beginning, perhaps, with the later acquired fixations, and going on, as the lifestyle develops, to the original ones\".[8]\nIn the service of the ego\n[edit]Ernst Kris supplements Freud's general formulations with a specific notion of \"regression in the service of the ego\"...the specific means whereby preconscious and unconscious material appear in the creator's consciousness'.[9] Kris thus opened the way for ego psychology to take a more positive view of regression. Carl Jung had earlier argued that 'the patient's regressive tendency...is not just a relapse into infantilism, but an attempt to get at something necessary...the universal feeling of childhood innocence, the sense of security, of protection, of reciprocated love, of trust'.[10] Kris however was concerned rather to differentiate the way that 'Inspiration -...in which the ego controls the primary process and puts it into its service – needs to be contrasted with the opposite...condition, in which the ego is overwhelmed by the primary process'.[11]\nNevertheless his view of regression in the service of the ego could be readily extended into a quasi-Romantic image of the creative process, in which 'it is only in the fiery storm of a profound regression, in the course of which the personality undergoes both dissolution of structure and reorganization, that the genius becomes capable of wresting himself from the traditional pattern that he had been forced to integrate through the identifications necessitated and enforced by the oedipal constellation'.[12]\nFrom there it was perhaps only a small step to the 1960s valorisation of regression as a positive good in itself. 'In this particular type of journey, the direction we have to take is back and in....They will say we are regressed and withdrawn and out of contact with them. True enough, we have a long, long way to back to contact the reality'.[13] Jungians had however already warned that 'romantic regression meant a surrender to the non-rational side which had to be paid for by a sacrifice of the rational and individual side';[14] and Freud for his part had dourly noted that 'this extraordinary plasticity of mental developments is not unrestricted in direction; it may be described as a special capacity for involution – regression – since it may well happen that a later and higher level of development, once abandoned, cannot be reached again'.[15]\nLater views\n[edit]Anna Freud (1936) ranked regression first in her enumeration of the defense mechanisms',[16] and similarly suggested that people act out behaviors from the stage of psychosexual development in which they are fixated. For example, an individual fixated at an earlier developmental stage might cry or sulk upon hearing unpleasant news.\nMichael Balint distinguishes between two types of regression: a nasty \"malignant\" regression that the Oedipal level neurotic is prone to... and the \"benign\" regression of the basic-fault patient.[17] The problem then is what the analyst can do 'to ensure that his patient's regression should be therapeutic and any danger of a pathological regression avoided'.[18]\nOthers have highlighted the technical dilemmas of dealing with regression from different if complementary angles. On the one hand, making premature 'assumptions about the patient's state of regression in the therapy...regarded as still at the breast', for example, might block awareness of more adult functioning on the patient's part: of the patient's view of the therapist '.[19] The opposite mistake would be 'justifying a retreat from regressive material presented by a patient. When a patient begins to trust the analyst or therapist it will be just such disturbing aspects of the internal world that will be presented for understanding – not for a panic retreat by the therapist'.[20]\nPeter Blos suggested that 'revisiting of early psychic positions...helps the adolescent come out of the family envelope', and that 'Regression during adolescence thus advances the cause of development'.[21] Stanley Olinick speaks of 'regression in the service of the other' on the part of the analyst 'during his or her clinical work. Such ego regression is a pre-condition for empathy'.[22]\nDemonstration of pain, impairment, etc. also relates to regression. When regression becomes the cornerstone of a personality and the life strategy for overcoming problems, it leads to such an infantile personality.[23]\nIn fiction\n[edit]- A clear example of regressive behavior in fiction can be seen in J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye. Holden constantly contradicts the progression of time and the aging process by reverting to childish ideas of escape, unrealistic expectations and frustration produced by his numerous shifts in behavior. His tendencies to reject responsibility and society as a whole because he 'doesn't fit in' also pushes him to prolonged use of reaction formation, unnecessary generalizations, and compulsive lying.\n- A similar example occurs in Samuel Beckett's Krapp's Last Tape. Krapp is fixated on reliving earlier times, and reenacts the fetal condition in his 'den'. He is unable to form mature relationships with women, seeing them only as replacements for his deceased mother. He experiences physical ailments that are linked to his fetal complex, struggling to perform digestive functions on his own. This literal anal retentiveness exemplifies his inefficacy as an independent adult.\nSee also\n[edit]References\n[edit]- ^ \"Regression\". APA Dictionary of Psychology.

          "content": "Cell (biology)\nThe cell is the basic structural and functional unit of all forms of life. Every cell consists of cytoplasm enclosed within a membrane; many cells contain organelles, each with a specific function. The term comes from the Latin word cellula meaning 'small room'. Most cells are only visible under a microscope. Cells emerged on Earth about 4 billion years ago. All cells are capable of replication, protein synthesis, and motility.\nCells are broadly categorized into two types: eukaryotic cells, which possess a nucleus, and prokaryotic cells, which lack a nucleus but have a nucleoid region. Prokaryotes are single-celled organisms such as bacteria, whereas eukaryotes can be either single-celled, such as amoebae, or multicellular, such as some algae, plants, animals, and fungi. Eukaryotic cells contain organelles including mitochondria, which provide energy for cell functions, chloroplasts, which in plants create sugars by photosynthesis, and ribosomes, which synthesise proteins.\nCells were discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665, who named them after their resemblance to cells inhabited by Christian monks in a monastery. Cell theory, developed in 1839 by Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann, states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells, that cells are the fundamental unit of structure and function in all living organisms, and that all cells come from pre-existing cells.\nCell types\nCells are broadly categorized into two types: eukaryotic cells, which possess a nucleus, and prokaryotic cells, which lack a nucleus but have a nucleoid region. Prokaryotes are single-celled organisms, whereas eukaryotes can be either single-celled or multicellular.\nProkaryotic cells\nProkaryotes include bacteria and archaea, two of the three domains of life. Prokaryotic cells were the first form of life on Earth, characterized by having vital biological processes including cell signaling. They are simpler and smaller than eukaryotic cells, and lack a nucleus, and other membrane-bound organelles. The DNA of a prokaryotic cell consists of a single circular chromosome that is in direct contact with the cytoplasm. The nuclear region in the cytoplasm is called the nucleoid. Most prokaryotes are the smallest of all organisms, ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 μm in diameter.[1]: 78\nA prokaryotic cell has three regions:\n- Enclosing the cell is the cell envelope, generally consisting of a plasma membrane covered by a cell wall which, for some bacteria, may be further covered by a third layer called a capsule. Though most prokaryotes have both a cell membrane and a cell wall, there are exceptions such as Mycoplasma (bacteria) and Thermoplasma (archaea) which only possess the cell membrane layer. The envelope gives rigidity to the cell and separates the interior of the cell from its environment, serving as a protective filter. The cell wall consists of peptidoglycan in bacteria and acts as an additional barrier against exterior forces. It also prevents the cell from expanding and bursting (cytolysis) from osmotic pressure due to a hypotonic environment. Some eukaryotic cells (plant cells and fungal cells) also have a cell wall.\n- Inside the cell is the cytoplasmic region that contains the genome (DNA), ribosomes and various sorts of inclusions.[2] The genetic material is freely found in the cytoplasm. Prokaryotes can carry extrachromosomal DNA elements called plasmids, which are usually circular. Linear bacterial plasmids have been identified in several species of spirochete bacteria, including members of the genus Borrelia notably Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease.[3] Though not forming a nucleus, the DNA is condensed in a nucleoid. Plasmids encode additional genes, such as antibiotic resistance genes.\n- On the outside, some prokaryotes have flagella and pili that project from the cell's surface. These are structures made of proteins that facilitate movement and communication between cells.\nEukaryotic cells\nPlants, animals, fungi, slime moulds, protozoa, and algae are all eukaryotic. These cells are about fifteen times wider than a typical prokaryote and can be as much as a thousand times greater in volume. The main distinguishing feature of eukaryotes as compared to prokaryotes is compartmentalization: the presence of membrane-bound organelles (compartments) in which specific activities take place. Most important among these is a cell nucleus,[2] an organelle that houses the cell's DNA. This nucleus gives the eukaryote its name, which means \"true kernel (nucleus)\". Some of the other differences are:\n- The plasma membrane resembles that of prokaryotes in function, with minor differences in the setup. Cell walls may or may not be present.\n- The eukaryotic DNA is organized in one or more linear molecules, called chromosomes, which are associated with histone proteins. All chromosomal DNA is stored in the cell nucleus, separated from the cytoplasm by a membrane.[2] Some eukaryotic organelles such as mitochondria also contain some DNA.\n- Many eukaryotic cells are ciliated with primary cilia. Primary cilia play important roles in chemosensation, mechanosensation, and thermosensation. Each cilium may thus be \"viewed as a sensory cellular antennae that coordinates a large number of cellular signaling pathways, sometimes coupling the signaling to ciliary motility or alternatively to cell division and differentiation.\"[4]\n- Motile eukaryotes can move using motile cilia or flagella. Motile cells are absent in conifers and flowering plants.[citation needed] Eukaryotic flagella are more complex than those of prokaryotes.[5]\nMany groups of eukaryotes are single-celled. Among the many-celled groups are animals and plants. The number of cells in these groups vary with species; it has been estimated that the human body contains around 37 trillion (3.72×1013) cells,[7] and more recent studies put this number at around 30 trillion (~36 trillion cells in the male, ~28 trillion in the female).[8]\nSubcellular components\nAll cells, whether prokaryotic or eukaryotic, have a membrane that envelops the cell, regulates what moves in and out (selectively permeable), and maintains the electric potential of the cell. Inside the membrane, the cytoplasm takes up most of the cell's volume. Except red blood cells, which lack a cell nucleus and most organelles to accommodate maximum space for hemoglobin, all cells possess DNA, the hereditary material of genes, and RNA, containing the information necessary to build various proteins such as enzymes, the cell's primary machinery. There are also other kinds of biomolecules in cells. This article lists these primary cellular components, then briefly describes their function.\nCell membrane\nThe cell membrane, or plasma membrane, is a selectively permeable[citation needed] biological membrane that surrounds the cytoplasm of a cell. In animals, the plasma membrane is the outer boundary of the cell, while in plants and prokaryotes it is usually covered by a cell wall. This membrane serves to separate and protect a cell from its surrounding environment and is made mostly from a double layer of phospholipids, which are amphiphilic (partly hydrophobic and partly hydrophilic). Hence, the layer is called a phospholipid bilayer, or sometimes a fluid mosaic membrane. Embedded within this membrane is a macromolecular structure called the porosome the universal secretory portal in cells and a variety of protein molecules that act as channels and pumps that move different molecules into and out of the cell.[2] The membrane is semi-permeable, and selectively permeable, in that it can either let a substance (molecule or ion) pass through freely, to a limited extent or not at all.[citation needed] Cell surface membranes also contain receptor proteins that allow cells to detect external signaling molecules such as hormones.[9]\nCytoskeleton\nThe cytoskeleton acts to organize and maintain the cell's shape; anchors organelles in place; helps during endocytosis, the uptake of external materials by a cell, and cytokinesis, the separation of daughter cells after cell division; and moves parts of the cell in processes of growth and mobility. The eukaryotic cytoskeleton is composed of microtubules, intermediate filaments and microfilaments. In the cytoskeleton of a neuron the intermediate filaments are known as neurofilaments. There are a great number of proteins associated with them, each controlling a cell's structure by directing, bundling, and aligning filaments.[2] The prokaryotic cytoskeleton is less well-studied but is involved in the maintenance of cell shape, polarity and cytokinesis.[10] The subunit protein of microfilaments is a small, monomeric protein called actin. The subunit of microtubules is a dimeric molecule called tubulin. Intermediate filaments are heteropolymers whose subunits vary among the cell types in different tissues. Some of the subunit proteins of intermediate filaments include vimentin, desmin, lamin (lamins A, B and C), keratin (multiple acidic and basic keratins), and neurofilament proteins (NF–L, NF–M).\nGenetic material\nTwo different kinds of genetic material exist: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). Cells use DNA for their long-term information storage. The biological information contained in an organism is encoded in its DNA sequence.[2] RNA is used for information transport (e.g., mRNA) and enzymatic functions (e.g., ribosomal RNA). Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules are used to add amino acids during protein translation.\nProkaryotic genetic material is organized in a simple circular bacterial chromosome in the nucleoid region of the cytoplasm. Eukaryotic genetic material is divided into different,[2] linear molecules called chromosomes inside a discrete nucleus, usually with additional genetic material in some organelles like mitochondria and chloroplasts (see endosymbiotic theory).\nA human cell has genetic material contained in the cell nucleus (the nuclear genome) and in the mitochondria (the mitochondrial genome). In humans, the nuclear genome is divided into 46 linear DNA molecules called chromosomes, including 22 homologous chromosome pairs and a pair of sex chromosomes. The mitochondrial genome is a circular DNA molecule distinct from nuclear DNA. Although the mitochondrial DNA is very small compared to nuclear chromosomes,[2] it codes for 13 proteins involved in mitochondrial energy production and specific tRNAs.\nForeign genetic material (most commonly DNA) can also be artificially introduced into the cell by a process called transfection. This can be transient, if the DNA is not inserted into the cell's genome, or stable, if it is. Certain viruses also insert their genetic material into the genome.\nOrganelles\nOrganelles are parts of the cell that are adapted and/or specialized for carrying out one or more vital functions, analogous to the organs of the human body (such as the heart, lung, and kidney, with each organ performing a different function).[2] Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells have organelles, but prokaryotic organelles are generally simpler and are not membrane-bound.\nThere are several types of organelles in a cell. Some (such as the nucleus and Golgi apparatus) are typically solitary, while others (such as mitochondria, chloroplasts, peroxisomes and lysosomes) can be numerous (hundreds to thousands). The cytosol is the gelatinous fluid that fills the cell and surrounds the organelles.\nEukaryotic\n- Cell nucleus: A cell's information center, the cell nucleus is the most conspicuous organelle found in a eukaryotic cell. It houses the cell's chromosomes, and is the place where almost all DNA replication and RNA synthesis (transcription) occur. The nucleus is spherical and separated from the cytoplasm by a double membrane called the nuclear envelope, space between these two membrane is called perinuclear space. The nuclear envelope isolates and protects a cell's DNA from various molecules that could accidentally damage its structure or interfere with its processing. During processing, DNA is transcribed, or copied into a special RNA, called messenger RNA (mRNA). This mRNA is then transported out of the nucleus, where it is translated into a specific protein molecule. The nucleolus is a specialized region within the nucleus where ribosome subunits are assembled. In prokaryotes, DNA processing takes place in the cytoplasm.[2]\n- Mitochondria and chloroplasts: generate energy for the cell. Mitochondria are self-replicating double membrane-bound organelles that occur in various numbers, shapes, and sizes in the cytoplasm of all eukaryotic cells.[2] Respiration occurs in the cell mitochondria, which generate the cell's energy by oxidative phosphorylation, using oxygen to release energy stored in cellular nutrients (typically pertaining to glucose) to generate ATP (aerobic respiration). Mitochondria multiply by binary fission, like prokaryotes. Chloroplasts can only be found in plants and algae, and they capture the sun's energy to make carbohydrates through photosynthesis.\n- Endoplasmic reticulum: The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a transport network for molecules targeted for certain modifications and specific destinations, as compared to molecules that float freely in the cytoplasm. The ER has two forms: the rough ER, which has ribosomes on its surface that secrete proteins into the ER, and the smooth ER, which lacks ribosomes.[2] The smooth ER plays a role in calcium sequestration and release and also helps in synthesis of lipid.\n- Golgi apparatus: The primary function of the Golgi apparatus is to process and package the macromolecules such as proteins and lipids that are synthesized by the cell.\n- Lysosomes and peroxisomes: Lysosomes contain digestive enzymes (acid hydrolases). They digest excess or worn-out organelles, food particles, and engulfed viruses or bacteria. Peroxisomes have enzymes that rid the cell of toxic peroxides, Lysosomes are optimally active in an acidic environment. The cell could not house these destructive enzymes if they were not contained in a membrane-bound system.[2]\n- Centrosome: the cytoskeleton organizer: The centrosome produces the microtubules of a cell—a key component of the cytoskeleton. It directs the transport through the ER and the Golgi apparatus. Centrosomes are composed of two centrioles which lie perpendicular to each other in which each has an organization like a cartwheel, which separate during cell division and help in the formation of the mitotic spindle. A single centrosome is present in the animal cells. They are also found in some fungi and algae cells.\n- Vacuoles: Vacuoles sequester waste products and in plant cells store water. They are often described as liquid filled spaces and are surrounded by a membrane. Some cells, most notably Amoeba, have contractile vacuoles, which can pump water out of the cell if there is too much water. The vacuoles of plant cells and fungal cells are usually larger than those of animal cells. Vacuoles of plant cells are surrounded by a membrane which transports ions against concentration gradients.\nEukaryotic and prokaryotic\n- Ribosomes: The ribosome is a large complex of RNA and protein molecules.[2] They each consist of two subunits, and act as an assembly line where RNA from the nucleus is used to synthesise proteins from amino acids. Ribosomes can be found either floating freely or bound to a membrane (the rough endoplasmatic reticulum in eukaryotes, or the cell membrane in prokaryotes).[11]\n- Plastids: Plastid are membrane-bound organelle generally found in plant cells and euglenoids and contain specific pigments, thus affecting the colour of the plant and organism. And these pigments also helps in food storage and tapping of light energy. There are three types of plastids based upon the specific pigments. Chloroplasts contain chlorophyll and some carotenoid pigments which helps in the tapping of light energy during photosynthesis. Chromoplasts contain fat-soluble carotenoid pigments like orange carotene and yellow xanthophylls which helps in synthesis and storage. Leucoplasts are non-pigmented plastids and helps in storage of nutrients.[12]\nStructures outside the cell membrane\nMany cells also have structures which exist wholly or partially outside the cell membrane. These structures are notable because they are not protected from the external environment by the cell membrane. In order to assemble these structures, their components must be carried across the cell membrane by export processes.\nCell wall\nMany types of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have a cell wall. The cell wall acts to protect the cell mechanically and chemically from its environment, and is an additional layer of protection to the cell membrane. Different types of cell have cell walls made up of different materials; plant cell walls are primarily made up of cellulose, fungi cell walls are made up of chitin and bacteria cell walls are made up of peptidoglycan.\nProkaryotic\nCapsule\nA gelatinous capsule is present in some bacteria outside the cell membrane and cell wall. The capsule may be polysaccharide as in pneumococci, meningococci or polypeptide as Bacillus anthracis or hyaluronic acid as in streptococci. Capsules are not marked by normal staining protocols and can be detected by India ink or methyl blue, which allows for higher contrast between the cells for observation.[13]: 87\nFlagella\nFlagella are organelles for cellular mobility. The bacterial flagellum stretches from cytoplasm through the cell membrane(s) and extrudes through the cell wall. They are long and thick thread-like appendages, protein in nature. A different type of flagellum is found in archaea and a different type is found in eukaryotes.\nFimbriae\nA fimbria (plural fimbriae also known as a pilus, plural pili) is a short, thin, hair-like filament found on the surface of bacteria. Fimbriae are formed of a protein called pilin (antigenic) and are responsible for the attachment of bacteria to specific receptors on human cells (cell adhesion). There are special types of pili involved in bacterial conjugation.\nCellular processes\nReplication\nCell division involves a single cell (called a mother cell) dividing into two daughter cells. This leads to growth in multicellular organisms (the growth of tissue) and to procreation (vegetative reproduction) in unicellular organisms. Prokaryotic cells divide by binary fission, while eukaryotic cells usually undergo a process of nuclear division, called mitosis, followed by division of the cell, called cytokinesis. A diploid cell may also undergo meiosis to produce haploid cells, usually four. Haploid cells serve as gametes in multicellular organisms, fusing to form new diploid cells.\nDNA replication, or the process of duplicating a cell's genome,[2] always happens when a cell divides through mitosis or binary fission. This occurs during the S phase of the cell cycle.\nIn meiosis, the DNA is replicated only once, while the cell divides twice. DNA replication only occurs before meiosis I. DNA replication does not occur when the cells divide the second time, in meiosis II.[14] Replication, like all cellular activities, requires specialized proteins for carrying out the job.[2]\nDNA repair\nCells of all organisms contain enzyme systems that scan their DNA for damage and carry out repair processes when it is detected. Diverse repair processes have evolved in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. The widespread prevalence of these repair processes indicates the importance of maintaining cellular DNA in an undamaged state in order to avoid cell death or errors of replication due to damage that could lead to mutation. E. coli bacteria are a well-studied example of a cellular organism with diverse well-defined DNA repair processes. These include: nucleotide excision repair, DNA mismatch repair, non-homologous end joining of double-strand breaks, recombinational repair and light-dependent repair (photoreactivation).[15]\nGrowth and metabolism\nBetween successive cell divisions, cells grow through the functioning of cellular metabolism. Cell metabolism is the process by which individual cells process nutrient molecules. Metabolism has two distinct divisions: catabolism, in which the cell breaks down complex molecules to produce energy and reducing power, and anabolism, in which the cell uses energy and reducing power to construct complex molecules and perform other biological functions.\nComplex sugars can be broken down into simpler sugar molecules called monosaccharides such as glucose. Once inside the cell, glucose is broken down to make adenosine triphosphate (ATP),[2] a molecule that possesses readily available energy, through two different pathways. In plant cells, chloroplasts create sugars by photosynthesis, using the energy of light to join molecules of water and carbon dioxide.\nProtein synthesis\nCells are capable of synthesizing new proteins, which are essential for the modulation and maintenance of cellular activities. This process involves the formation of new protein molecules from amino acid building blocks based on information encoded in DNA/RNA. Protein synthesis generally consists of two major steps: transcription and translation.\nTranscription is the process where genetic information in DNA is used to produce a complementary RNA strand. This RNA strand is then processed to give messenger RNA (mRNA), which is free to migrate through the cell. mRNA molecules bind to protein-RNA complexes called ribosomes located in the cytosol, where they are translated into polypeptide sequences. The ribosome mediates the formation of a polypeptide sequence based on the mRNA sequence. The mRNA sequence directly relates to the polypeptide sequence by binding to transfer RNA (tRNA) adapter molecules in binding pockets within the ribosome. The new polypeptide then folds into a functional three-dimensional protein molecule.\nMotility\nUnicellular organisms can move in order to find food or escape predators. Common mechanisms of motion include flagella and cilia.\nIn multicellular organisms, cells can move during processes such as wound healing, the immune response and cancer metastasis. For example, in wound healing in animals, white blood cells move to the wound site to kill the microorganisms that cause infection. Cell motility involves many receptors, crosslinking, bundling, binding, adhesion, motor and other proteins.[16] The process is divided into three steps: protrusion of the leading edge of the cell, adhesion of the leading edge and de-adhesion at the cell body and rear, and cytoskeletal contraction to pull the cell forward. Each step is driven by physical forces generated by unique segments of the cytoskeleton.[17][16]\nNavigation, control and communication\nIn August 2020, scientists described one way cells—in particular cells of a slime mold and mouse pancreatic cancer-derived cells—are able to navigate efficiently through a body and identify the best routes through complex mazes: generating gradients after breaking down diffused chemoattractants which enable them to sense upcoming maze junctions before reaching them, including around corners.[18][19][20]\nMulticellularity\nCell specialization/differentiation\nMulticellular organisms are organisms that consist of more than one cell, in contrast to single-celled organisms.[21]\nIn complex multicellular organisms, cells specialize into different cell types that are adapted to particular functions. In mammals, major cell types include skin cells, muscle cells, neurons, blood cells, fibroblasts, stem cells, and others. Cell types differ both in appearance and function, yet are genetically identical. Cells are able to be of the same genotype but of different cell type due to the differential expression of the genes they contain.\nMost distinct cell types arise from a single totipotent cell, called a zygote, that differentiates into hundreds of different cell types during the course of development. Differentiation of cells is driven by different environmental cues (such as cell–cell interaction) and intrinsic differences (such as those caused by the uneven distribution of molecules during division).\nOrigin of multicellularity\nMulticellularity has evolved independently at least 25 times,[22] including in some prokaryotes, like cyanobacteria, myxobacteria, actinomycetes, or Methanosarcina. However, complex multicellular organisms evolved only in six eukaryotic groups: animals, fungi, brown algae, red algae, green algae, and plants.[23] It evolved repeatedly for plants (Chloroplastida), once or twice for animals, once for brown algae, and perhaps several times for fungi, slime molds, and red algae.[24] Multicellularity may have evolved from colonies of interdependent organisms, from cellularization, or from organisms in symbiotic relationships.\nThe first evidence of multicellularity is from cyanobacteria-like organisms that lived between 3 and 3.5 billion years ago.[22] Other early fossils of multicellular organisms include the contested Grypania spiralis and the fossils of the black shales of the Palaeoproterozoic Francevillian Group Fossil B Formation in Gabon.[25]\nThe evolution of multicellularity from unicellular ancestors has been replicated in the laboratory, in evolution experiments using predation as the selective pressure.[22]\nOrigins\nThe origin of cells has to do with the origin of life, which began the history of life on Earth.\nOrigin of life\nSmall molecules needed for life may have been carried to Earth on meteorites, created at deep-sea vents, or synthesized by lightning in a reducing atmosphere. There is little experimental data defining what the first self-replicating forms were. RNA may have been the earliest self-replicating molecule, as it can both store genetic information and catalyze chemical reactions.[26]\nCells emerged around 4 billion years ago.[27][28] The first cells were most likely heterotrophs. The early cell membranes were probably simpler and more permeable than modern ones, with only a single fatty acid chain per lipid. Lipids spontaneously form bilayered vesicles in water, and could have preceded RNA.[29][30]\nFirst eukaryotic cells\nEukaryotic cells were created some 2.2 billion years ago in a process called eukaryogenesis. This is widely agreed to have involved symbiogenesis, in which archaea and bacteria came together to create the first eukaryotic common ancestor. This cell had a new level of complexity and capability, with a nucleus[32][33] and facultatively aerobic mitochondria.[31] It evolved some 2 billion years ago into a population of single-celled organisms that included the last eukaryotic common ancestor, gaining capabilities along the way, though the sequence of the steps involved has been disputed, and may not have started with symbiogenesis. It featured at least one centriole and cilium, sex (meiosis and syngamy), peroxisomes, and a dormant cyst with a cell wall of chitin and/or cellulose.[34][35] In turn, the last eukaryotic common ancestor gave rise to the eukaryotes' crown group, containing the ancestors of animals, fungi, plants, and a diverse range of single-celled organisms.[36][37] The plants were created around 1.6 billion years ago with a second episode of symbiogenesis that added chloroplasts, derived from cyanobacteria.[31]\nHistory of research\nIn 1665, Robert Hooke examined a thin slice of cork under his microscope, and saw a structure of small enclosures. He wrote \"I could exceeding plainly perceive it to be all perforated and porous, much like a Honey-comb, but that the pores of it were not regular\".[38] To further support his theory, Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann both also studied cells of both animal and plants. What they discovered were significant differences between the two types of cells. This put forth the idea that cells were not only fundamental to plants, but animals as well.[39]\n- 1632–1723: Antonie van Leeuwenhoek taught himself to make lenses, constructed basic optical microscopes and drew protozoa, such as Vorticella from rain water, and bacteria from his own mouth.[40]\n- 1665: Robert Hooke discovered cells in cork, then in living plant tissue using an early compound microscope. He coined the term cell (from Latin cellula, meaning \"small room\"[41]) in his book Micrographia (1665).[42][40]\n- 1839: Theodor Schwann[43] and Matthias Jakob Schleiden elucidated the principle that plants and animals are made of cells, concluding that cells are a common unit of structure and development, and thus founding the cell theory.\n- 1855: Rudolf Virchow stated that new cells come from pre-existing cells by cell division (omnis cellula ex cellula).\n- 1931: Ernst Ruska built the first transmission electron microscope (TEM) at the University of Berlin.[44] By 1935, he had built an EM with twice the resolution of a light microscope, revealing previously unresolvable organelles.\n- 1981: Lynn Margulis published Symbiosis in Cell Evolution detailing how eukaryotic cells were created by symbiogenesis.[45]\nSee also\nReferences\n- ^ Black, Jacquelyn G.

          "content": "cell\nWhat is a cell?\nWhat is cell theory?\nWhat do cell membranes do?\ncell, in biology, the basic membrane-bound unit that contains the fundamental molecules of life and of which all living things are composed. A single cell is often a complete organism in itself, such as a bacterium or yeast. Other cells acquire specialized functions as they mature. These cells cooperate with other specialized cells and become the building blocks of large multicellular organisms, such as humans and other animals. Although cells are much larger than atoms, they are still very small. The smallest known cells are a group of tiny bacteria called mycoplasmas; some of these single-celled organisms are spheres as small as 0.2 μm in diameter (1μm = about 0.000039 inch), with a total mass of 10−14 gram—equal to that of 8,000,000,000 hydrogen atoms. Cells of humans typically have a mass 400,000 times larger than the mass of a single mycoplasma bacterium, but even human cells are only about 20 μm across. It would require a sheet of about 10,000 human cells to cover the head of a pin, and each human organism is composed of more than 30,000,000,000,000 cells.\nThis article discusses the cell both as an individual unit and as a contributing part of a larger organism. As an individual unit, the cell is capable of metabolizing its own nutrients, synthesizing many types of molecules, providing its own energy, and replicating itself in order to produce succeeding generations. It can be viewed as an enclosed vessel, within which innumerable chemical reactions take place simultaneously. These reactions are under very precise control so that they contribute to the life and procreation of the cell. In a multicellular organism, cells become specialized to perform different functions through the process of cell differentiation. In order to do this, each cell keeps in constant communication with its neighbors. As it receives nutrients from and expels wastes into its surroundings, it adheres to and cooperates with other cells. Cooperative assemblies of similar cells form tissues, and a cooperation between tissues in turn forms organs, which carry out the functions necessary to sustain the life of an organism.\nSpecial emphasis is given in this article to animal cells, with some discussion of the energy-synthesizing processes and extracellular components peculiar to plants. (For detailed discussion of the biochemistry of plant cells, see photosynthesis. For a full treatment of the genetic events in the cell nucleus, see heredity.)\nThe nature and function of cells\nA cell is enclosed by a plasma membrane, which forms a selective barrier that allows nutrients to enter and waste products to leave. The interior of the cell is organized into many specialized compartments, or organelles, each surrounded by a separate membrane. One major organelle, the nucleus, contains the genetic information necessary for cell growth and reproduction. Each cell contains only one nucleus, whereas other types of organelles are present in multiple copies in the cellular contents, or cytoplasm. Organelles include mitochondria, which are responsible for the energy transactions necessary for cell survival; lysosomes, which digest unwanted materials within the cell; and the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, which play important roles in the internal organization of the cell by synthesizing selected molecules and then processing, sorting, and directing them to their proper locations. In addition, plant cells contain chloroplasts, which are responsible for photosynthesis, whereby the energy of sunlight is used to convert molecules of carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) into carbohydrates. Between all these organelles is the space in the cytoplasm called the cytosol. The cytosol contains an organized framework of fibrous molecules that constitute the cytoskeleton, which gives a cell its shape, enables organelles to move within the cell, and provides a mechanism by which the cell itself can move. The cytosol also contains more than 10,000 different kinds of molecules that are involved in cellular biosynthesis, the process of making large biological molecules from small ones.\nSpecialized organelles are a characteristic of cells of organisms known as eukaryotes. In contrast, cells of organisms known as prokaryotes do not contain organelles and are generally smaller than eukaryotic cells. However, all cells share strong similarities in biochemical function.\nThe molecules of cells\nCells contain a special collection of molecules that are enclosed by a membrane. These molecules give cells the ability to grow and reproduce. The overall process of cellular reproduction occurs in two steps: cell growth and cell division. During cell growth, the cell ingests certain molecules from its surroundings by selectively carrying them through its cell membrane. Once inside the cell, these molecules are subjected to the action of highly specialized, large, elaborately folded molecules called enzymes. Enzymes act as catalysts by binding to ingested molecules and regulating the rate at which they are chemically altered. These chemical alterations make the molecules more useful to the cell. Unlike the ingested molecules, catalysts are not chemically altered themselves during the reaction, allowing one catalyst to regulate a specific chemical reaction in many molecules.\nBiological catalysts create chains of reactions. In other words, a molecule chemically transformed by one catalyst serves as the starting material, or substrate, of a second catalyst and so on. In this way, catalysts use the small molecules brought into the cell from the outside environment to create increasingly complex reaction products. These products are used for cell growth and the replication of genetic material. Once the genetic material has been copied and there are sufficient molecules to support cell division, the cell divides to create two daughter cells. Through many such cycles of cell growth and division, each parent cell can give rise to millions of daughter cells, in the process converting large amounts of inanimate matter into biologically active molecules.",

          "content": "There’s nothing like a challenge. In 2016, biologists Aviv Regev and Sarah Teichmann launched an initiative with around 100 other scientists. They set themselves the monumentally ambitious goal of cataloguing every cell type in the human body, from development to old age1. That amounts to mapping the body’s estimated 37.2 trillion cells. The task was made even more complex by the fact that cells don’t sit still, waiting to be recorded. They continually change as a result of factors including ancestry, geography, gender and age — indeed, life itself.\nThe Human Cell Atlas: towards a first draft atlas\nThis week, that initiative, the Human Cell Atlas (HCA), is releasing a collection of studies that represent a significant step towards assembling a first draft atlas. Thanks to some 9,000 donors around the world, the HCA teams now have data on around 62 million human cells, categorized according to 18 biological networks — including maps of cells in the nervous system, lungs, heart, gut and immune system.\nWhy is this work needed? Cells are the basic building blocks of living things. The atlas offers to boost researchers’ understanding of how the body works — in health, but also, importantly, in disease. Knowledge of where particular cells are located, combined with in-depth information about the genes they express and the epigenetic markers they carry, is revealing new insights into biology and disease.\nFindings from researchers working on the lung cell atlas, for example, highlight the differences between the lungs of a sample of people in Malawi who died from COVID-19 and those who died from other lung diseases2. Scientists have also been studying the development of organs during gestation, for example, through analyses of prenatal human skin3 and developing joints and craniums4.\nCellular atlases are unlocking the mysteries of the human body\nThe HCA would not have been possible without earlier projects, notably the Human Genome Project and, more recently, the NIH BRAIN Initiative, as well as ENCODE, a project to build a ‘parts list’ of functional elements in the human genome. The HCA teams have also worked hard to reflect human diversity in their data. The consortium includes scientists from Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East5. Researchers from these regions were invited not only to join, but also to help lead and coordinate HCA projects, and to do so according to priorities relevant to local populations. The initiative now involves more than 3,000 scientists across some 1,700 institutions, recording and studying data from people in around 100 countries.\nThe findings are, the researchers say, the beginning of a journey towards a first draft. There’s a long way to travel between mapping 62 million cells and mapping one billion, let alone trillions. For the HCA to succeed, its funders must remain committed for the long term. These include public funders, such as the European Commission and the US National Institutes of Health, and philanthropic organizations, such as the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and Wellcome.\nVarious metaphors have been used to describe the atlas: some have called it the ‘Google Maps of the human body’, others ‘the periodic table of cells’. It is also a Wikipedia for cells — a bottom-up and open resource, established and run by the scientific community, and the researchers leading its development intend it to remain open access in the long term. And that means continued funding will be essential.\nWhat is a cell type, really? The quest to categorize life’s myriad forms\nMost research projects — including those involving large-scale consortiums — have a limited lifespan. Ten years is considered generous. A handful of projects might last a few years longer. Permanent funding tends to be reserved for projects of national or international importance, including essential infrastructure — the tools and technologies without which vital discoveries and inventions would not be possible. That is what the HCA needs to be compared to.\n“While genetic studies have mapped more than 100,000 disease-associated variants in the human genome, we do not know in which cells the majority of these variants are active,” HCA researchers write6. Without this knowledge, they add, “we cannot fully understand biology, study more powerful models of disease, deploy better diagnostics, and develop more effective therapies”.\nThe HCA teams have made a strong start, but the project is an ultra-marathon, not a sprint. If its goals are to be realized, scientists and funders around the world must double down on their commitment.",

          "content": "Cell (Dragon Ball)\nCell (Japanese: セル, Hepburn: Seru), later known as Semi-Perfect Cell, Perfect Cell, and Super Perfect Cell, is a fictional character and antagonist in the Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama. He makes his debut appearance in chapter #361 \"The Mysterious Monster, Finally Appears!!\", first published in Weekly Shōnen Jump on 16 February 1992.[2]\nCreated by Doctor Gero, a main member of the Red Ribbon Army, Cell is an evil artificial life form created using the DNA and cells from several significant strong characters in the series. He travels back in time from an alternate timeline to become a perfect being and defeat Goku.\nCreation and conception\n[edit]After Kazuhiko Torishima, Toriyama's former editor during Dr. Slump and early Dragon Ball, expressed dissatisfaction with first Androids #19 and #20 and later Androids #17 and #18 as villains, Toriyama created Cell.[3][4] Toriyama has expressed some kind of regret regarding the design of Cell, calling it tedious to draw all the little spots on his body.[4] In addition, he did not initially plan for the character to be able to transform, but gave him this ability after his then-current editor Yū Kondō described Cell as \"ugly.\"[3] Toriyama intended for Cell's second form to last longer than it did; Kondō found the form to be silly and urged him to hasten the first appearance of the next transformation.[5]\nNorio Wakamoto is the Japanese voice of Cell and revealed that when he voiced the forms of Cell, the first form was monster-like, he used a raspy voice which he said was a pain. He toned it down for the second, and by the final form, he was able to perform comfortably.[6]\nIn the English Funimation dub, Cell is voiced by Dameon Clarke.[7] Clarke considers Cell one of his more \"fun and entertaining\" characters.[8] Clarke said that he based the voice of Perfect Cell off of Terence Stamp's General Zod from Superman II.[9] Sometime around the release of Resurrection 'F', in which Frieza returned, Clarke said he began receiving questions about a film featuring Cell's return, which he supported.[10]\nAbilities\n[edit]Thanks to being genetically created from the DNA of several of the Z-Fighters (specifically Goku, Vegeta, and Piccolo), as well as the villain Frieza and his father King Cold, being spliced together; Cell has the superhuman abilities of all the aforementioned characters. What makes him distinct from other Android models is the ability to generate, manipulate, and strengthen himself with a life energy called ki very similar to most naturally-born organic users of it. He also can mask his presence to avoid detection and can generate an aura similar to a Super Saiyan. Along with telepathy and telekinesis, Cell knows how to use the special attacks the Z-Fighters use, such as the Kamehameha and the Solar Flare. Cell is specifically designed to continuously evolve by absorbing Androids #17 and #18 to achieve his final and most powerful stage, with each form gaining monstrous boosts in overall physical strength, durability, and speed. He can also increase his power by using his tail to absorb bio-energy from any living creature.\nDue to the Saiyan cells embedded in his being, Cell is able to imprint on a near-death experience and grow stronger, while memorizing new techniques at his disposal, such as Goku's teleportation move referred to as Instant Transmission.\nAppearances\n[edit]Dragon Ball Z\n[edit]Cell is an artificial life form (referred to as a \"Bio-Android\") created by Doctor Gero's supercomputer from cell samples of the universe's strongest warriors, possessing the genetic information of Goku, Vegeta, Piccolo, King Cold, and Frieza in an underground complex beneath Gero's secret laboratory. The Cell that appears as the primary antagonist of his titular arc is from the future, awakening after his development is complete to find that the Androids have been destroyed by Trunks. After he kills Trunks, Cell uses his time machine while regressing into an egg to travel back four years, to before the androids appeared, arriving in the present timeline.[11] After hatching and metamorphosing from his larval, cicada-like form into his insect-like Imperfect form, Cell kills off thousands of people and absorbs them to increase his power in preparation to absorb the Androids. After he has managed to absorb the energy of entire cities of people, Cell finds Android #17 during his fight with Piccolo. Cell then breaks Piccolo's neck[12] before Android #16 holds the mechanized villain off. However, he eventually finds an opportunity to absorb #17 and evolve into Semi-Perfect Cell. Cell quickly dispatches #16, but he is unable to absorb #18 thanks to the intervention of Tien Shinhan, who holds him back at the cost of his life force[13] before being rescued by Goku, along with a surviving Piccolo.\nCell tries to find Android #18, destroying islands to intimidate her into showing herself, but before he can destroy the island that #18 is hiding on, Vegeta appears and overwhelms him with newfound power.[14] At the brink of defeat, Cell talks Vegeta into letting him absorb Android #18 so he can give him a better fight, and upon doing so, he assumes his final form, which is much more human-like. In this form, Cell easily defeats Krillin,[15] Vegeta,[16] and Trunks, but spares all of them so that they can come to his fighting tournament, the Cell Games (セルゲーム, Seru Gēmu) to find a worthy opponent to face him, intending to destroy Earth when he wins and wanting to enjoy the fear he causes in others.[17]\nA week later, in the first round of the Cell Games, he quickly defeats Mr. Satan before moving onto Goku, who quits upon realizing Cell is stronger than him.[18] Goku then nominates his son, Gohan, as Cell's next opponent, to everyone's surprise. Though Gohan puts up a good fight and proves himself his father's superior,[19] Cell takes the upper hand due to Gohan's pacifistic nature. Wanting to avoid killing Cell if he can help it, Gohan warns Cell that if he is pushed too far, he will lose control of his anger and kill him, which only drives Cell to torment him further, excited to see this power. He spawns Cell Juniors (セルジュニア, Seru Junia), miniature versions of himself who begin to fight the heroes, causing Gohan's rage to slowly swell. It is only when Cell mercilessly kills #16 after he had encouraged Gohan to fight that Gohan snaps, transforming into a Super Saiyan 2.[20] Gohan effortlessly and violently kills all the Cell Juniors and then proceeds to overpower Cell himself, aiming to prolong his suffering, dealing so much damage that Cell regurgitates Android #18 and reverts to his previous form.[21] In desperation, Cell tries to self-destruct and destroy the Earth, but Goku sacrifices himself by using his Instant Transmission technique to teleport himself and Cell to King Kai's planet, where Cell explodes, killing everyone there.[22]\nCell, however, survives thanks to his unique physiology, which allows him to regenerate from a special nucleus in his head and grow more powerful whenever he has almost been killed, returning to his Perfect form even stronger than before.[23] He quickly kills Trunks, and when Vegeta attacks him in retaliation, easily swats him aside. Cell tries to kill Vegeta with an energy blast, but Gohan takes the blast in his place, injuring his arm.[24] With victory in his grasp, Cell decides to destroy the planet with one last Kamehameha, claiming he has the power to destroy the entire Solar System.[25] Assisted by his father in spirit, Gohan retaliates with his own Kamehameha, ultimately overpowering Cell with Vegeta's help, destroying his cell nucleus and killing him once and for all.[26] Mr. Satan, however, takes credit for the victory and becomes a hero.\nUpon being resurrected by the Dragon Balls and returning to the future, Trunks destroys Androids #17 and #18. Afterward, he realizes from his previous travels that Cell is likely to emerge soon. Three years later, Trunks is confronted by the Cell of his timeline, who plans to kill Trunks and use his time machine in the same way his alternate self had. This Cell knew that Trunks had traveled back and learned of him in the past, but still believes himself more powerful than Trunks. However, Trunks showcases his newfound power and quickly dispatches him, finally bringing peace to his part of the timeline.[27]\nIn later episodes of the anime, Cell makes numerous cameo appearances, usually as comic relief. In his posthumous appearances, he is shown causing trouble in Hell along with Frieza, King Cold, and the Ginyu Force. He is defeated by Goku and Pikkon and sent to prison and is later seen watching Goku's battle with Majin Buu on a crystal ball, openly wondering why Goku quit against him and then went on to fight Buu, whom he acknowledges to be a stronger opponent than himself.[28]\nDragon Ball Super\n[edit]A few years later, when Trunks travels back to the past again, Trunks reacts in confusion to seeing Goku alive as he remembers his death from Cell's self-destructing. Goku informs him of his resurrection that occurred after Trunks had returned to his time. Not long after, Bulma is revealed to have retained the Time Capsule that Cell had stolen from Trunks to return to the present timeline. Cell is remembered by Trunks when he notes the differences between Gohan as a child, in particular when he fought Cell, and him as an adult upon meeting him for the first time in years.[29] An illusion of Cell appears in the Forest of Fear to Krillin and Goku,[30] attacking the pair and growing in size before Krillin concentrates and dispels the illusion by confronting his fear.[31]\nAlthough the original Cell does not appear in the film Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero, his schematics were used by the revived Red Ribbon Army to create a stronger model designated as \"Cell Max\", a red-armored variant of Cell's Semi-Perfect form that lacks the original Cell's ability to regenerate. Serving as the film's final antagonist, he was activated by a desperate Magenta before his mind was fully developed, coming across as a mindless, rampaging monster.\nIn other media\n[edit]In Dragon Ball GT, after Goku is sent to Hell by accident, he confronts both Cell and Frieza, whose bodies have been rendered temporarily immortal due to the upset in the balance between the two worlds. Though Cell and Frieza trap Goku with their new joint attack and freeze him using a witch below them,[32] they too are frozen after venturing down to gloat at him, and due to being dead, are unable to thaw out as Goku did. Goku accidentally breaks the ice Cell and Frieza are trapped within, in pieces, implying that Cell and Frieza have been erased from existence.[33] However, in a future scene, Frieza and Cell are seen being taken away in a jail cell with tape over their mouths. Cell and Frieza also appear in the GT live-action show, with new forms.\nCell appears in a TV ad for Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods, questioning why he is not in the film while Frieza brags that he is, Cell then remarks that Frieza only has a non-speaking appearance.[34]\nCell appears in TeamFourStar's Dragon Ball Z Abridged, voiced by Curtis \"Takahata101\" Arnott.[35][36]\nVideo games\n[edit]Cell appears in several video games as a boss and playable character, most notably the Budokai, Budokai Tenkaichi and Raging Blast series. He is also a playable character in the Dragon Ball Z: Collectible Card Game. In several games, Cell has forms that have been created specifically for the installment.\nIn the 1995 game Dragon Ball Z: Super Battle, after Goku defeats Cell, he gives him a Senzu Bean and allows him to live. Cell responds by promising to return and win.\nIn Dragon Ball Z: Budokai, Cell has a nightmare where he accidentally absorbs Krillin and becomes Cellin (セルリン, Serurin), with the form leaving him weaker.[37] In the 2003 game Dragon Ball Z: Budokai 2, Cell is revived by Bobbidi and becomes a Majin, his appearance being altered with the letter \"M\" on his forehead alongside black lining appearing under his eyes. This form is short-lived, as Majin Buu terminates Bobbidi, and absorbs Cell shortly afterward.[38]\nIn the 2005 video game Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi, Cell defeats Gohan and confronts Super 17, defeating him when the two fight over a shared interest in killing Goku.\nIn the 2015 game Dragon Ball: Xenoverse, Cell appears as a mentor for the player, teaching the Perfect Kamehameha, Perfect Shot, All Clear and Gravity Impact to the player. Within the context of the game's story mode, Cell defeats Gohan until the player intervenes in their fight,[39] and the version of the character from Trunks' timeline reaches his Perfect form thanks to Towa's strengthening, though he is destroyed by the player and Trunks.[40]\nIn the 2016 game Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2, Cell shows up in his Perfect Form and fights Trunks, also meeting Android 16 for the first time and fighting alongside him.[41] Cell reaches his Perfect form after defeating both Piccolo and #16, then absorbing #17 and #18 at the same time.[42] When an empowered Android #17 fights Piccolo, Trunks warns the player that Cell succeeding in absorbing this version of #17 would mean an even larger power boost than in the main timeline.[43] Cell himself shows up empowered, easily defeating Android #16. Cell later fights alongside the corrupted Cell Juniors, and welcomes Metal Cooler to the Cell Games.[44]\nIn the 2018 game Dragon Ball FighterZ, Cell defeats Android 18[45] and is confronted by Goku and Krillin while aiming a beam at her and Android 21.[46] After being defeated,[47] Cell uses the Solar Flare to escape.[48] Cell laments his lack of power before being confronted by Frieza,[49] who offers him a deal where the two share information with each other.[50] The player then controls Cell after Goku is shot by Android 21,[51] and fights Android 21 with Cell.[52] Cell escapes from Android 21 with another Solar Flare, and the player returns to Goku[53] from the strain on Cell's body[54]\nCell is also a playable character in the crossover fighting games Battle Stadium D.O.N. and Jump Force, as well as a supporting character in Jump Ultimate Stars.\nIn Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero, Cell appears with several playable forms each with unique special attacks.[55]\nReception\n[edit]In 2004, fans of the series voted Cell the fourteenth most popular character for a poll in the book Dragon Ball Forever.[56] In 2015, Jacob Yothment ranked Cell No. 3 on his list Top 10 Villains of the Dragon Ball Franchise,[57] Shawn Saris of IGN ranked Cell No. 7 on the list Top 13 Dragon Ball Z Characters,[58] and Otakukart.com ranked Cell No. 2 on the list Top 10 Dragon Ball Villains.[59] In 2016, Cell was ranked No. 6 on the saikoplus.com list 10 Most Popular Characters in Dragon Ball Z.[60]\nMichael Zupan assessed Cell as the Dragon Ball villain with the most buildup, writing, \"The Z Fighters throw everything they have at this character, and just when you think he's beat... he transforms into something more powerful.\"[61] Dennis Amith of J!-ENT described Cell as \"the toughest enemy that the team has fought yet\" and liked how the efforts of the other characters trying to stop Cell is the main focus of that part of the series.[62] J. Steiff and T. D. Tamplin used Cell as an example of the concept of \"leveling up\" in anime and believed Cell follows this concept well.[63]\nThe concept of the Cell Games and its execution were criticized. D. F. Smith of IGN criticized Cell's decision to hold a fighting tournament instead of destroying Earth as a sign that the author has run out of ideas.[64] Reviewer Josh Begley had disapproval toward the tournament as he believed it would feature \"endless fighting and no real plot progression.\"[65] Luke Ryan Baldock took issue with the tournament based season for its lack of plot and high amount of action.[66]\nSee also\n[edit]References\n[edit]- ^ \"Norio Wakamoto (visual voices guide)\".

          "content": "Cell\nIn biology, the cell is the basic structure of organisms. All cells are made by the division of other cells.\nThe environment outside the cell is separated from the cytoplasm inside the cell by the cell membrane. Inside some cells, parts of the cell stay separate from other parts. These separate parts are called organelles (like small organs). They each do different things in the cell. Examples are the nucleus (where DNA is), and mitochondria (where chemical energy is converted).[1][2]\nKinds of cells\n[change | change source]Cell can be divided into different types depending on the structure of the nucleus and the physiological function. In 1957 cells were divided into two types based on the structure of nucleus. These were the prokaryotic cell and the eukaryotic cell. Prokaryotes, such as bacteria and archaea, are simple cells that have no cell nucleus. They do have bacterial microcompartments.\nEukaryotes are complex cells with many organelles and other structures in the cell. They are larger than prokaryote cells: they can be as much as 1000 times greater in volume. Eukaryotes store their genetic information (DNA) on chromosomes in the cell nucleus. Organisms (living things) which are made up of multiple cells are eukaryotes.\nMost cells are small, the largest just being seen by the human eye (egg cell). They need to be small in order to work as they should.[3]\nKinds of prokaryotic organisms\n[change | change source]The only kinds of prokaryotic organisms are bacteria and archaea.[4] Prokaryotic organisms evolved before eukaryotic organisms, so at one point the world consisted of nothing but prokaryotic organisms. There are also viruses, which are biological organisms. They always reproduce inside the cells of other organisms. They cause some important diseases. Viruses are made of RNA, or DNA, and protein, and they reproduce themselves inside the cells of bacteria or eukaryotes.\nRegions of prokaryotic cell\n[change | change source]The prokaryotic cell has three regions namely the cell envelope, cytoplasmic region and flagella or pili.\n- Cell envelope: This consists of the plasma membrane covered by a cell wall. Some bacteria have a third layer called a capsule. Prokaryotes such as Mycoplasma and Thermoplasma only have a cell membrane layer. The envelope gives protection to the cell and separates the inside of the cell from its environment.\n- Cytoplasmic region: This region is found inside the cell and contains the genome (DNA), ribosomes and other cell inclusions. Since prokaryotes do not have a nucleus, the genetic material is free in the cytoplasm.\n- Flagella/Pili: These structures are not present in all prokaryotes. The flagella and pili extends from the surface of the cell, and they help in movement and communication between cells[5]\nKinds of eukaryotic organisms\n[change | change source]Unicellular\n[change | change source]Unicellular organisms are made up of one cell. Examples of unicellular organisms are:\nUnicellular organisms need to:\nAll unicellular organisms must:\n- get rid of waste (discard)\n- reproduce (make more of itself)\n- grow\nSome may:\n- move\n- sense their environment\n- get their energy from the sun (e.g., cyanobacteria)\n- ferment (e.g., yeasts)\n- use anaerobic respiration (e.g. Clostridium botulinum)\nMulticellular\n[change | change source]Multicellular organisms are made from many cells. They are complex organisms. This can be a small number of cells, or millions or trillions of cells. All plants and animals are multicellular organisms. The cells of a multicellular organism are not all the same. They have different shapes and sizes, and do different work in the organism. The cells are specialised, this means they do only some kinds of work. By themselves, they cannot do everything that the organism needs to live. They need other cells to do other work. They live together, but cannot live alone.\nCell history\n[change | change source]Cells were discovered by Robert Hooke (1635–1703). He used a compound microscope with two lenses to look at the structure of cork, and to look at leaves and some insects. He did this from about 1660, and reported it in his book Micrographica in 1665. He named cells after the Latin word cella, meaning room. He did this because he thought cells looked like small rooms.\nMany other naturalists and philosophers tried out the new instrument. The structure of plants was investigated by Nehemiah Grew (1641–1712) and Marcello Malpighi (1628–1694). Grew's major work was The anatomy of plants (1682).[6] It is not clear who first saw animal cells, Malpighi, Jan Swammerdam (1637–1680) or Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632–1723).[6]p17\nLeeuwenhoek's discoveries and drawings of 'little animalcules' opened up a whole new world for naturalists. Protozoa, and microorganisms generally were discovered, and the discoveries about them are still going on today. Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg's book Die Infusionsthierchen summarised what was known in 1838. Lorenz Oken (1779–1851) in 1805 wrote that infusoria (microscopic forms) were the basis of all life.\nThe idea that cells were the basis of the larger forms of life came in the 18th century. Finding out who did the work has taken some time:\n- \"The work of the Czech Jan Purkyně (1787–1869) and his student and collaborator Gabriel Valentin (1810–1883) was unjustly denigrated by the nationalistic Germans. They have a claim to some priority in the cell theory\".[6]Chapter 9 Johannes Müller (1801–1858) also made great contributions. \"It was, however, his student Theodor Schwann (1810–1882) and Matthias Schleiden (1804–1881) who got the credit for the cell theory, despite the fact that some of their observations were not correct, and their credits to previous workers were \"a travesty\".[6]p97\nThe cell theory includes these important ideas: [7]\n- All living things are made of cells.\n- The cell is the basic unit of structure and function in all organisms.\n- Every cell comes from another cell that lived before it.\n- The nucleus is the core element of the cell.\nCell reproduction\n[change | change source]The body cells of metazoans divide by simple mitotic cell division. Sexual reproduction is ancestral in eukaryotes, and in metazoa it is carried out by specialised sex cells. They are produced by a process called meiosis.\nProkaryotic cells reproduce using binary fission, where the cell simply splits in half. For both mitosis and binary fission the cell must replicate (copy) all its genetic information (DNA) so that each new cell will have a copy.\nRelated pages\n[change | change source]References\n[change | change source]- ↑ Alberts B. et al. 2002.

          "content": "Network (1976 film)\nNetwork is a 1976 American satirical black comedy drama film directed by Sidney Lumet and written by Paddy Chayefsky. It is about a fictional television network and its struggle with poor ratings. The film stars Faye Dunaway, William Holden, Peter Finch (in his final film role), Robert Duvall, Wesley Addy, Ned Beatty, and Beatrice Straight.\nProduced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and released by United Artists on November 27, 1976, Network was a commercial success, earning $23.7 million on a $3.8 million production budget. Widely considered to be one of the greatest films ever made, Network received widespread critical acclaim, with particular praise for its screenplay and performances. At the 49th Academy Awards, it received ten nominations, including Best Picture, and won four: Best Actor for Finch (posthumously), Best Actress for Dunaway, Best Supporting Actress for Straight, and Best Original Screenplay for Chayefsky.\nIn 2000, Network was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[3][4] In 2002, it was inducted into the Producers Guild of America Hall of Fame as a film that has \"set an enduring standard for American entertainment\".[5] In 2005 the Writers Guild of America voted Chayefsky's screenplay one of the 10 greatest in history.[6] In 2007, the film was 64th among the 100 greatest American films as chosen by the American Film Institute.\nPlot\n[edit]In September 1975, Howard Beale, the longtime anchor for the UBS Evening News, the flagship evening news program of the Union Broadcasting System (UBS), learns from friend and news division president Max Schumacher that he has just two more weeks on the air because of declining ratings. The following night, Beale announces to his audience that he will kill himself on next Tuesday's newscast. UBS tries to immediately fire Beale, but Schumacher intervenes so that he can have a dignified farewell. Beale promises to apologize for his outburst, but once on the air, he launches into a rant about life being \"bullshit\". Beale's outburst causes ratings to spike, and much to Schumacher's dismay, UBS executives decide to exploit the situation. When Beale's ratings soon top out, programming chief Diana Christensen reaches out to Schumacher with an offer to help \"develop\" Beale's show. He declines the professional proposal but accepts her more personal pitch; the two begin an affair.\nWhen Schumacher decides to end Beale's \"angry man\" format, Christensen persuades her boss, Frank Hackett, to slot the evening news show under the entertainment division so she can develop it. Hackett bullies UBS executives to consent and fire Schumacher. In one impassioned diatribe, Beale galvanizes the nation, persuading viewers to shout, \"I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!\" from their windows. He is soon hosting a new program called The Howard Beale Show, top-billed as \"the mad prophet of the airwaves\". The show becomes the most highly rated program on television, and Beale finds new celebrity preaching his angry populist message in front of a live studio audience that, on cue, chants his signature catchphrase: \"We're as mad as hell, and we're not going to take this anymore!\" Schumacher and Christensen's romance withers as the show flourishes, but in the flush of high ratings, the two ultimately find their way back together; Schumacher separates from his wife of over 25 years for Christensen.\nSeeking another hit, Christensen cuts a deal with a terrorist group called the Ecumenical Liberation Army (ELA) for a new docudrama series, The Mao Tse-Tung Hour, for which the ELA will provide exclusive footage of their activities. Meanwhile, Beale discovers that Communications Corporation of America (CCA), the parent company of UBS, will be bought out by a larger Saudi conglomerate. He urges his audience to pressure the White House to quash the deal. This panics UBS because the network's debt load has made the merger essential for its survival. CCA chairman Arthur Jensen arranges a meeting with Beale, describing the interrelatedness of the participants in the international economy and the illusory nature of nationality distinctions. Jensen scolds Beale and persuades him to abandon his message and preach a new gospel that serves Jensen's interests.\nChristensen's fanatical devotion to her job and emotional emptiness ultimately drive Schumacher away, warning her that she will self-destruct if she continues on her current path. Audiences find Beale's new sermons on the dehumanization of society depressing and ratings start to slip, yet Jensen refuses to fire him. To boost the network's ratings, Christensen, Hackett and the other executives decide to hire the ELA to assassinate Beale on the air. The assassination succeeds, putting an end to The Howard Beale Show and kicking off the second season of The Mao Tse-Tung Hour. A voice-over proclaims, \"This was the story of Howard Beale: the first known instance of a man who was killed because he had lousy ratings.\"\nCast\n[edit]- Faye Dunaway as Diana Christensen\n- William Holden as Max Schumacher\n- Peter Finch as Howard Beale\n- Robert Duvall as Frank Hackett\n- Wesley Addy as Nelson Chaney\n- Ned Beatty as Arthur Jensen\n- Jordan Charney as Harry Hunter\n- Conchata Ferrell as Barbara Schlesinger\n- Darryl Hickman as Bill Herron\n- Roy Poole as Sam Haywood\n- William Prince as Edward George Ruddy\n- Beatrice Straight as Louise Schumacher\n- Marlene Warfield as Laureen Hobbs\n- Arthur Burghardt as Great Ahmed Kahn\n- Kathy Cronkite as Mary Ann Gifford\n- Ed Crowley as Joe Donnelly\n- Bill Burrows as TV Director\n- Cindy Grover as Caroline Schumacher\n- Lane Smith as Robert McDonough\n- Michael Lombard as Willie Stein\n- Lance Henriksen as Network Lawyer (uncredited)\n- Andrew Duncan as Agent (uncredited)\nIn addition, Lee Richardson provides various moments of narration advancing additional plot details.\nProduction\n[edit]Development and writing\n[edit]Network came only two years after the first on-screen suicide in television history, of television news reporter Christine Chubbuck in Sarasota, Florida.[7] The anchorwoman was suffering from depression and loneliness, was often emotionally distant from her co-workers, and shot herself on camera as stunned viewers watched on July 15, 1974. Chayefsky used the idea of a live death as his film's terminating focal point, to say later in an interview, \"Television will do anything for a rating... anything!\" However, Dave Itzkoff's book (Mad as Hell: The Making of Network and the Fateful Vision of the Angriest Man in Movies) allows that whether Chayefsky was inspired by the Chubbuck case remains unclear, that Chayefsky's screenplay notes on the week of the live death have nothing about the incident in them, and grants it is an eerie parallel. It was to be months later that actual direct reference was made, Chayefsky writing for Beale to bray that he \"will blow my brains out right on the air ... like that girl in Florida\", which was later removed.[8] Sidney Lumet made the categorical statement that the character of Howard Beale was never based on any real-life person.[9]\nBefore beginning his screenplay, Chayefsky visited network TV offices. He was surprised to learn that television executives did not watch much television. \"The programs they put on 'had to' be bad, had to be something they wouldn't watch,\" he remarked. \"Imagine having to work like that all your life.\"[10] According to Dave Itzkoff, what Chayefsky saw while writing the screenplay during the midst of Watergate and the Vietnam War was the entirety of America's anger being broadcast in everything from sitcoms to news reports. He concluded that Americans \"don't want jolly, happy family type shows like Eye Witness News\" ... \"the American people are angry and want angry shows.\"[11] When he began writing his script he had intended on a comedy, but instead directed his frustration at the content being broadcast on television—which he described as \"an indestructible and terrifying giant that is stronger than the government\"—into the screenplay. It became a \"dark satire about an unstable news anchor and a broadcasting company and a viewing public all too happy to follow him over the brink of sanity.\"[11] The character of network executive Diana Christiansen was based on NBC daytime television programming executive Lin Bolen,[12] which Bolen disputed.[13]\nChayefsky and producer Howard Gottfried had just come off a lawsuit against United Artists, challenging the studio's right to lease their previous film, The Hospital, to ABC in a package with a less successful film. Despite this recent legal action, Chayefsky and Gottfried signed a deal with UA to finance Network, until UA found the subject matter too controversial and backed out. Undeterred, Chayefsky and Gottfried shopped the script around to other studios, and eventually found an interested party in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Soon afterward, United Artists reversed itself and looked to co-finance the film with MGM, since the latter had an ongoing distribution arrangement with UA in North America. Since MGM agreed to let UA back on board, the former (through United Artists as per the arrangement) controlled North American/Caribbean rights, with UA opting for overseas distribution.[a]\nCasting\n[edit]In his notes, Chayefsky jotted down his ideas about casting. For Howard Beale, who would eventually be played by Peter Finch, he envisioned Henry Fonda, Cary Grant, James Stewart and Paul Newman. He went so far as to write Newman, telling him that \"You and a very small handful of other actors are the only ones I can think of with the range for this part.\" Lumet wanted Fonda, with whom he had worked several times, but Fonda declined the role, finding it too \"hysterical\" for his taste. Stewart also found the script unsuitable, objecting to the strong language. Early consideration was given to real-life newscasters Walter Cronkite and John Chancellor, but neither was open to the idea (both appear during the opening scene through stock footage). Although not mentioned in Chayefsky's notes, George C. Scott, Glenn Ford and William Holden reportedly also turned down the opportunity to play Beale, with Holden instead playing Max Schumacher: For that role, Chayefsky had initially listed Walter Matthau and Gene Hackman. Ford was under consideration for this part as well, and he was said to be one of two final contenders. Holden finally got the edge because of his recent box-office success with The Towering Inferno.[14]\nProducers were wary that Finch, an Australian, would not be able to sound authentically American; they demanded an audition before his casting could be considered. A well-known actor, Finch reportedly responded, \"Bugger pride. Put the script in the mail.\" Immediately excited by the role, he agreed to pay his own fare to New York for a screen test. He prepared for the audition by listening to broadcasts by American newscasters and reading the international editions of The New York Times and the Herald Tribune into a tape recorder, then listening to playbacks with a critical ear. Gottfried recalled that Finch \"was nervous as hell at that first meeting over lunch and just like a kid auditioning. Once we'd heard him, Sidney Lumet, Paddy, and I were ecstatic because we knew it was a hell of a part to cast.\" Finch further convinced Lumet by playing him the tapes of his newspaper readings.[15]\nFaye Dunaway wanted Robert Mitchum to play Max Schumacher, but Lumet refused, believing that Mitchum was not sufficiently urbane.[16][17] For the role of Diana Christensen, Chayefsky thought of Candice Bergen, Ellen Burstyn, and Natalie Wood, while the studio suggested Jane Fonda, with alternate candidates Kay Lenz, Diane Keaton, Marsha Mason and Jill Clayburgh. Lumet wanted to cast Vanessa Redgrave in the film, but Chayefsky did not want her. Lumet argued that he thought she was the greatest English-speaking actress in the world, while Chayefsky, a proud Jew and supporter of Israel, objected on the basis of her support of the PLO. Lumet, also a Jew, said \"Paddy, that's blacklisting!\", to which Chayefsky replied, \"Not when a Jew does it to a Gentile.\"[18]\nDunaway was cast as Diana in September 1975. Lumet told her that he would edit any attempts on her part to make her character sympathetic and insisted on presenting her without any vulnerability. Lumet cast Robert Duvall as Frank Hackett. Duvall saw Hackett as a \"vicious president Ford\".[19] On Duvall, Lumet said: \"What's fascinating about Duvall is how funny he is.\" Ned Beatty was cast as Arthur Jensen on the recommendation of director Robert Altman after the original actor failed to live up to Lumet's standards. Beatty had one night to prepare a four-page speech, and was finished after one day's shooting. Beatrice Straight played Louise Schumacher, Max's wife, on whom he cheats with Diana.[20] Straight had won a Tony Award in 1953 for playing an anguished wife who is similarly cheated on in Arthur Miller's The Crucible.\nFilming\n[edit]After two weeks of rehearsals, filming started in Toronto in January 1976[21] with many scenes filmed at the CFTO studios at 9 Channel Nine Court in Scarborough.[22]\nLumet recalled that Chayefsky was usually on set during filming, and sometimes offered advice about how certain scenes should be played. Lumet allowed that his old friend had the better comic instincts of the two. Finch, who had suffered from heart problems for many years, became physically and psychologically exhausted by the demands of playing Beale.[23]\nThere was some concern that the combination of Holden and Dunaway might create conflict on the set, since the two had sparred during an earlier co-starring stint in The Towering Inferno. According to biographer Bob Thomas, Holden had been incensed by Dunaway's behavior during the filming of the disaster epic, especially her habit of leaving him fuming on the set while she attended to her hair, makeup and telephone calls. One day, after a two-hour wait, Holden reportedly grabbed Dunaway by the shoulders, pushed her against a soundstage wall and snapped, \"You do that to me once more, and I'll push you through that wall!\"[citation needed]\nLumet and cinematographer Owen Roizman worked out a complicated lighting scheme that in Lumet's words would \"corrupt the camera\". Lumet recalled: \"We started with an almost naturalistic look. For the first scene between Peter Finch and Bill Holden, on Sixth Avenue at night, we added only enough light to get an exposure. As the movie progressed, camera setups became more rigid, more formal. The lighting became more and more artificial. The next-to-final scene—where Faye Dunaway, Robert Duvall, and the three network gray suits decide to kill Peter Finch—is lit like a commercial. The camera setups are static and framed like still pictures. The camera had also become a victim of television.\"[18]\nRelease and reception\n[edit]Network premiered in New York City on November 27, 1976, and went into wide release shortly afterward. The film opened to widespread critical acclaim, and became one of the big hits of 1976–77, earning $23.7 million at the box office.[2]\nCritical reception\n[edit]Vincent Canby of The New York Times called Network \"outrageous ... brilliantly, cruelly funny, a topical American comedy that confirms Paddy Chayefsky's position as a major new American satirist\" and a film whose \"wickedly distorted views of the way television looks, sounds, and, indeed, is, are the satirist's cardiogram of the hidden heart, not just of television but also of the society that supports it and is, in turn, supported.\"[24] Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave Network four stars out of four, calling it \"a very funny movie that takes an easy target and giddily beats it to death.\"[25] In a review written after Network received its Academy Awards, Roger Ebert called it a \"supremely well-acted, intelligent film that tries for too much, that attacks not only television but also most of the other ills of the 1970s,\" though \"what it does accomplish is done so well, is seen so sharply, is presented so unforgivingly, that Network will outlive a lot of tidier movies.\"[26]\nNot all reviews were positive: Pauline Kael in The New Yorker criticized the film's abundance of long, preachy speeches; Chayefsky's self-righteous contempt for not only television itself but also television viewers; and the fact that almost everyone in the movie, particularly Robert Duvall, has a shouting rant: \"The cast of this messianic farce takes turns yelling at us soulless masses.\"[27] Gary Arnold of The Washington Post declared that \"the movie is too sternly, monotonously preachy for either persuasion or casual amusement.\"[28] Michael Billington wrote, \"Too much of this film has the hectoring stridency of tabloid headlines\",[29] while Chris Petit in Time Out described it as \"slick, 'adult', self-congratulatory, and almost entirely hollow\", adding that \"most of the interest comes in watching such a lavishly mounted vehicle leaving the rails so spectacularly.\"[30]\nJack Shaheen, an American writer and lecturer who specialized in addressing racial and ethnic stereotypes, was critical of the film in his book, Reel Bad Arabs. He put it on his worst list, noting that Arabs were portrayed as \"medieval fanatics,\" and criticized Chayefsky's \"prejudicial Arab colloquies.\" He also asked whether Chayefsky would label Israelis as \"medieval fanatics\" and wondered why the producer, Howard Gottfried, and director, Sidney Lumet, sanctioned Chayefsky's \"anti-Arab diatribe,\" as he described it, in the film. He additionally described the film's focus on Arabs not only to be \"racist,\" but also nonfactual, and noted that Chayefsky condemned Vanessa Redgrave after she described demonstrators, protesting her pro-Palestinian views, as \"a small bunch of Zionist hoodlums\" at the 1978 Academy Awards ceremony.[31]\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 91% based on 76 reviews, with an average rating of 8.50/10. The site's critics consensus states, \"Driven by populist fury and elevated by strong direction, powerful acting, and an intelligent script, Network's searing satire of ratings-driven news remains sadly relevant more than four decades later.\"[32] On Metacritic it has a weighted average score of 83 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[33]\nLegacy\n[edit]In 2000, Roger Ebert added the film to his Great Movies list and said it was \"like prophecy. When Chayefsky created Howard Beale, could he have imagined Jerry Springer, Howard Stern, and the World Wrestling Federation?\"; he credits Lumet and Chayefsky for knowing \"just when to pull out all the stops.\"[34] Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin wrote in 2011 that \"no predictor of the future—not even Orwell—has ever been as right as Chayefsky was when he wrote Network.\"[35] The film ranks at number 100 in Empire magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Films of All Time.[36]\nAccolades\n[edit]At the 49th Academy Awards, Network won 3 of the 4 acting awards. As of 2024, it is the second of only 3 films which have accomplished this feat, preceded by A Streetcar Named Desire in 1951 and followed by Everything Everywhere All at Once in 2022.\nPeter Finch died before the 1977 ceremony and was the only performer to win a posthumous acting Academy Award until Heath Ledger won Best Supporting Actor in 2008. The statuette itself was collected by Finch's widow, Eletha Finch, after Paddy Chayefsky invited her onstage.\nBeatrice Straight appeared in only 5 minutes, 2 seconds of screen time, making it the shortest performance to win an Oscar as of 2024[update] (breaking Gloria Grahame's 9 minute, 32 seconds record for The Bad and the Beautiful in 1952).[37] Additionally, Ned Beatty's performance of Arthur Jensen occupied only 6 minutes of screen time, also making it the shortest performance by an actor to be nominated for an Oscar as of 2024[update].[38]\nAmerican Film Institute\n[edit]- AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies – #66\n- AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs – Nominated\n- AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains:\n- Diana Christensen – Nominated Villain\n- AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes:\n- \"I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!\" – #19\n- AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) – #64\nStage adaptation\n[edit]A play adaptation by Lee Hall premiered in the Lyttleton Theatre at the National Theatre in London in November 2017. The play was directed by Ivo Van Hove featuring Bryan Cranston making his UK stage debut as Howard Beale, and Michelle Dockery as Diana.[53][54] It opened on Broadway on December 6, 2018, with Cranston reprising his role as Beale, and with Tatiana Maslany as Diana and Tony Goldwyn as Max Schumacher.[55]\nNotes\n[edit]- ^ In 1981, several years after the film's release, United Artists merged with MGM to form MGM/UA Entertainment Co. (which became the worldwide rights holder to the film from 1982 to 1986). On March 25, 1986, Ted Turner's Turner Broadcasting System acquired MGM/UA Entertainment Co., and renamed MGM Entertainment Co., however, due to concerns in the financial community over the debt-load of his companies, in August of that same year, Turner was forced to sell the MGM name, all of United Artists back to Kerkorian for approximately $300 million after only months of ownership. Turner, however kept all of MGM's film, television and cartoon library released prior to May 23, 1986 and formed Turner Entertainment Co. to handle rights to this library on August 2, 1986. In 1996, Turner Broadcasting System merged with Time Warner (now Warner Bros. Discovery) putting the majority of the pre-May 1986 MGM library in the hands of Warner Bros. However, since Amazon MGM Studios (via United Artists) retained the rights to the film internationally, Network is in a unique position of being owned by both companies. Today, Warner Bros. (via Turner Entertainment Co.) controls the film in the North America, while Amazon MGM Studios (via United Artists) controls the film internationally.\n- ^ Posthumous award.\n- ^ a b Posthumous award.\n- ^ Tied with Annie Girardot for Run After Me Until I Catch You.\n- ^ Tied with Rocky.\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ \"Network (15)\".

          "content": "Computer network\nA computer network is a set of computers sharing resources located on or provided by network nodes. Computers use common communication protocols over digital interconnections to communicate with each other. These interconnections are made up of telecommunications network technologies based on physically wired, optical, and wireless radio-frequency methods that may be arranged in a variety of network topologies.\nThe nodes of a computer network can include personal computers, servers, networking hardware, or other specialized or general-purpose hosts. They are identified by network addresses and may have hostnames. Hostnames serve as memorable labels for the nodes and are rarely changed after initial assignment. Network addresses serve for locating and identifying the nodes by communication protocols such as the Internet Protocol.\nComputer networks may be classified by many criteria, including the transmission medium used to carry signals, bandwidth, communications protocols to organize network traffic, the network size, the topology, traffic control mechanisms, and organizational intent.[citation needed]\nComputer networks support many applications and services, such as access to the World Wide Web, digital video and audio, shared use of application and storage servers, printers and fax machines, and use of email and instant messaging applications.\nHistory\n[edit]Computer networking may be considered a branch of computer science, computer engineering, and telecommunications, since it relies on the theoretical and practical application of the related disciplines. Computer networking was influenced by a wide array of technological developments and historical milestones.\n- In the late 1950s, a network of computers was built for the U.S. military Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) radar system[1][2][3] using the Bell 101 modem. It was the first commercial modem for computers, released by AT&T Corporation in 1958. The modem allowed digital data to be transmitted over regular unconditioned telephone lines at a speed of 110 bits per second (bit/s).\n- In 1959, Christopher Strachey filed a patent application for time-sharing in the United Kingdom and John McCarthy initiated the first project to implement time-sharing of user programs at MIT.[4][5][6][7] Strachey passed the concept on to J. C. R. Licklider at the inaugural UNESCO Information Processing Conference in Paris that year.[8] McCarthy was instrumental in the creation of three of the earliest time-sharing systems (the Compatible Time-Sharing System in 1961, the BBN Time-Sharing System in 1962, and the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System in 1963).\n- In 1959, Anatoly Kitov proposed to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union a detailed plan for the re-organization of the control of the Soviet armed forces and of the Soviet economy on the basis of a network of computing centers.[9] Kitov's proposal was rejected, as later was the 1962 OGAS economy management network project.[10]\n- In 1960, the commercial airline reservation system semi-automatic business research environment (SABRE) went online with two connected mainframes.\n- In 1963, J. C. R. Licklider sent a memorandum to office colleagues discussing the concept of the \"Intergalactic Computer Network\", a computer network intended to allow general communications among computer users.\n- In 1965, Western Electric introduced the first widely used telephone switch that implemented computer control in the switching fabric.\n- Throughout the 1960s,[11][12] Paul Baran and Donald Davies independently invented the concept of packet switching for data communication between computers over a network.[13][14][15][16] Baran's work addressed adaptive routing of message blocks across a distributed network, but did not include routers with software switches, nor the idea that users, rather than the network itself, would provide the reliability.[17][18][19][20] Davies' hierarchical network design included high-speed routers, communication protocols and the essence of the end-to-end principle.[21][22][23][24] The NPL network, a local area network at the National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom), pioneered the implementation of the concept in 1968-69 using 768 kbit/s links.[25][23][26] Both Baran's and Davies' inventions were seminal contributions that influenced the development of computer networks.[27][28][29][30]\n- In 1969, the first four nodes of the ARPANET were connected using 50 kbit/s circuits between the University of California at Los Angeles, the Stanford Research Institute, the University of California at Santa Barbara, and the University of Utah.[31] Designed principally by Bob Kahn, the network's routing, flow control, software design and network control were developed by the IMP team working for Bolt Beranek & Newman.[32][33][34] In the early 1970s, Leonard Kleinrock carried out mathematical work to model the performance of packet-switched networks, which underpinned the development of the ARPANET.[35][36] His theoretical work on hierarchical routing in the late 1970s with student Farouk Kamoun remains critical to the operation of the Internet today.[37][38]\n- In 1972, commercial services were first deployed on experimental public data networks in Europe.[39][40]\n- In 1973, the French CYCLADES network, directed by Louis Pouzin was the first to make the hosts responsible for the reliable delivery of data, rather than this being a centralized service of the network itself.[41]\n- In 1973, Peter Kirstein put internetworking into practice at University College London (UCL), connecting the ARPANET to British academic networks, the first international heterogeneous computer network.[42][43]\n- In 1973, Robert Metcalfe wrote a formal memo at Xerox PARC describing Ethernet,[44] a local area networking system he created with David Boggs.[45] It was inspired by the packet radio ALOHAnet, started by Norman Abramson and Franklin Kuo at the University of Hawaii in the late 1960s.[46][47] Metcalfe and Boggs, with John Shoch and Edward Taft, also developed the PARC Universal Packet for internetworking.[48]\n- In 1974, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn published their seminal 1974 paper on internetworking, A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication.[49] Later that year, Cerf, Yogen Dalal, and Carl Sunshine wrote the first Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) specification, RFC 675, coining the term Internet as a shorthand for internetworking.[50]\n- In July 1976, Metcalfe and Boggs published their paper \"Ethernet: Distributed Packet Switching for Local Computer Networks\"[51] and in December 1977, together with Butler Lampson and Charles P. Thacker, they received U.S. patent 4063220A for their invention.[52][53]\n- Public data networks in Europe, North America and Japan began using X.25 in the late 1970s and interconnected with X.75.[14] This underlying infrastructure was used for expanding TCP/IP networks in the 1980s.[54]\n- In 1976, John Murphy of Datapoint Corporation created ARCNET, a token-passing network first used to share storage devices.\n- In 1977, the first long-distance fiber network was deployed by GTE in Long Beach, California.\n- In 1979, Robert Metcalfe pursued making Ethernet an open standard.[55]\n- In 1980, Ethernet was upgraded from the original 2.94 Mbit/s protocol to the 10 Mbit/s protocol, which was developed by Ron Crane, Bob Garner, Roy Ogus,[56] and Yogen Dalal.[57]\n- In 1995, the transmission speed capacity for Ethernet increased from 10 Mbit/s to 100 Mbit/s. By 1998, Ethernet supported transmission speeds of 1 Gbit/s. Subsequently, higher speeds of up to 400 Gbit/s were added (as of 2018[update]). The scaling of Ethernet has been a contributing factor to its continued use.[55]\nUse\n[edit]Computer networks enhance how users communicate with each other by using various electronic methods like email, instant messaging, online chat, voice and video calls, and video conferencing. Networks also enable the sharing of computing resources. For example, a user can print a document on a shared printer or use shared storage devices. Additionally, networks allow for the sharing of files and information, giving authorized users access to data stored on other computers. Distributed computing leverages resources from multiple computers across a network to perform tasks collaboratively.\nNetwork packet\n[edit]Most modern computer networks use protocols based on packet-mode transmission. A network packet is a formatted unit of data carried by a packet-switched network.\nPackets consist of two types of data: control information and user data (payload). The control information provides data the network needs to deliver the user data, for example, source and destination network addresses, error detection codes, and sequencing information. Typically, control information is found in packet headers and trailers, with payload data in between.\nWith packets, the bandwidth of the transmission medium can be better shared among users than if the network were circuit switched. When one user is not sending packets, the link can be filled with packets from other users, and so the cost can be shared, with relatively little interference, provided the link is not overused. Often the route a packet needs to take through a network is not immediately available. In that case, the packet is queued and waits until a link is free.\nThe physical link technologies of packet networks typically limit the size of packets to a certain maximum transmission unit (MTU). A longer message may be fragmented before it is transferred and once the packets arrive, they are reassembled to construct the original message.\nNetwork topology\n[edit]The physical or geographic locations of network nodes and links generally have relatively little effect on a network, but the topology of interconnections of a network can significantly affect its throughput and reliability. With many technologies, such as bus or star networks, a single failure can cause the network to fail entirely. In general, the more interconnections there are, the more robust the network is; but the more expensive it is to install. Therefore, most network diagrams are arranged by their network topology which is the map of logical interconnections of network hosts.\nCommon topologies are:\n- Bus network: all nodes are connected to a common medium along this medium. This was the layout used in the original Ethernet, called 10BASE5 and 10BASE2. This is still a common topology on the data link layer, although modern physical layer variants use point-to-point links instead, forming a star or a tree.\n- Star network: all nodes are connected to a special central node. This is the typical layout found in a small switched Ethernet LAN, where each client connects to a central network switch, and logically in a wireless LAN, where each wireless client associates with the central wireless access point.\n- Ring network: each node is connected to its left and right neighbor node, such that all nodes are connected and that each node can reach each other node by traversing nodes left- or rightwards. Token ring networks, and the Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), made use of such a topology.\n- Mesh network: each node is connected to an arbitrary number of neighbors in such a way that there is at least one traversal from any node to any other.\n- Fully connected network: each node is connected to every other node in the network.\n- Tree network: nodes are arranged hierarchically. This is the natural topology for a larger Ethernet network with multiple switches and without redundant meshing.\nThe physical layout of the nodes in a network may not necessarily reflect the network topology. As an example, with FDDI, the network topology is a ring, but the physical topology is often a star, because all neighboring connections can be routed via a central physical location. Physical layout is not completely irrelevant, however, as common ducting and equipment locations can represent single points of failure due to issues like fires, power failures and flooding.\nOverlay network\n[edit]An overlay network is a virtual network that is built on top of another network. Nodes in the overlay network are connected by virtual or logical links. Each link corresponds to a path, perhaps through many physical links, in the underlying network. The topology of the overlay network may (and often does) differ from that of the underlying one. For example, many peer-to-peer networks are overlay networks. They are organized as nodes of a virtual system of links that run on top of the Internet.[58]\nOverlay networks have been used since the early days of networking, back when computers were connected via telephone lines using modems, even before data networks were developed.\nThe most striking example of an overlay network is the Internet itself. The Internet itself was initially built as an overlay on the telephone network.[58] Even today, each Internet node can communicate with virtually any other through an underlying mesh of sub-networks of wildly different topologies and technologies. Address resolution and routing are the means that allow mapping of a fully connected IP overlay network to its underlying network.\nAnother example of an overlay network is a distributed hash table, which maps keys to nodes in the network. In this case, the underlying network is an IP network, and the overlay network is a table (actually a map) indexed by keys.\nOverlay networks have also been proposed as a way to improve Internet routing, such as through quality of service guarantees achieve higher-quality streaming media. Previous proposals such as IntServ, DiffServ, and IP multicast have not seen wide acceptance largely because they require modification of all routers in the network.[citation needed] On the other hand, an overlay network can be incrementally deployed on end-hosts running the overlay protocol software, without cooperation from Internet service providers. The overlay network has no control over how packets are routed in the underlying network between two overlay nodes, but it can control, for example, the sequence of overlay nodes that a message traverses before it reaches its destination[citation needed].\nFor example, Akamai Technologies manages an overlay network that provides reliable, efficient content delivery (a kind of multicast). Academic research includes end system multicast,[59] resilient routing and quality of service studies, among others.\nNetwork links\n[edit]The transmission media (often referred to in the literature as the physical medium) used to link devices to form a computer network include electrical cable, optical fiber, and free space. In the OSI model, the software to handle the media is defined at layers 1 and 2 — the physical layer and the data link layer.\nA widely adopted family that uses copper and fiber media in local area network (LAN) technology are collectively known as Ethernet. The media and protocol standards that enable communication between networked devices over Ethernet are defined by IEEE 802.3. Wireless LAN standards use radio waves, others use infrared signals as a transmission medium. Power line communication uses a building's power cabling to transmit data.\nWired\n[edit]The following classes of wired technologies are used in computer networking.\n- Coaxial cable is widely used for cable television systems, office buildings, and other work-sites for local area networks. Transmission speed ranges from 200 million bits per second to more than 500 million bits per second.[citation needed]\n- ITU-T G.hn technology uses existing home wiring (coaxial cable, phone lines and power lines) to create a high-speed local area network.\n- Twisted pair cabling is used for wired Ethernet and other standards. It typically consists of 4 pairs of copper cabling that can be utilized for both voice and data transmission. The use of two wires twisted together helps to reduce crosstalk and electromagnetic induction. The transmission speed ranges from 2 Mbit/s to 10 Gbit/s. Twisted pair cabling comes in two forms: unshielded twisted pair (UTP) and shielded twisted-pair (STP). Each form comes in several category ratings, designed for use in various scenarios.\n- An optical fiber is a glass fiber. It carries pulses of light that represent data via lasers and optical amplifiers. Some advantages of optical fibers over metal wires are very low transmission loss and immunity to electrical interference. Using dense wave division multiplexing, optical fibers can simultaneously carry multiple streams of data on different wavelengths of light, which greatly increases the rate that data can be sent to up to trillions of bits per second. Optic fibers can be used for long runs of cable carrying very high data rates, and are used for undersea communications cables to interconnect continents. There are two basic types of fiber optics, single-mode optical fiber (SMF) and multi-mode optical fiber (MMF). Single-mode fiber has the advantage of being able to sustain a coherent signal for dozens or even a hundred kilometers. Multimode fiber is cheaper to terminate but is limited to a few hundred or even only a few dozens of meters, depending on the data rate and cable grade.[60]\nWireless\n[edit]Network connections can be established wirelessly using radio or other electromagnetic means of communication.\n- Terrestrial microwave – Terrestrial microwave communication uses Earth-based transmitters and receivers resembling satellite dishes. Terrestrial microwaves are in the low gigahertz range, which limits all communications to line-of-sight. Relay stations are spaced approximately 40 miles (64 km) apart.\n- Communications satellites – Satellites also communicate via microwave. The satellites are stationed in space, typically in geosynchronous orbit 35,400 km (22,000 mi) above the equator. These Earth-orbiting systems are capable of receiving and relaying voice, data, and TV signals.\n- Cellular networks use several radio communications technologies. The systems divide the region covered into multiple geographic areas. Each area is served by a low-power transceiver.\n- Radio and spread spectrum technologies – Wireless LANs use a high-frequency radio technology similar to digital cellular. Wireless LANs use spread spectrum technology to enable communication between multiple devices in a limited area. IEEE 802.11 defines a common flavor of open-standards wireless radio-wave technology known as Wi-Fi.\n- Free-space optical communication uses visible or invisible light for communications. In most cases, line-of-sight propagation is used, which limits the physical positioning of communicating devices.\n- Extending the Internet to interplanetary dimensions via radio waves and optical means, the Interplanetary Internet.[61]\n- IP over Avian Carriers was a humorous April fool's Request for Comments, issued as RFC 1149. It was implemented in real life in 2001.[62]\nThe last two cases have a large round-trip delay time, which gives slow two-way communication but does not prevent sending large amounts of information (they can have high throughput).\nNetwork nodes\n[edit]Apart from any physical transmission media, networks are built from additional basic system building blocks, such as network interface controllers, repeaters, hubs, bridges, switches, routers, modems, and firewalls. Any particular piece of equipment will frequently contain multiple building blocks and so may perform multiple functions.\nNetwork interfaces\n[edit]A network interface controller (NIC) is computer hardware that connects the computer to the network media and has the ability to process low-level network information. For example, the NIC may have a connector for plugging in a cable, or an aerial for wireless transmission and reception, and the associated circuitry.\nIn Ethernet networks, each NIC has a unique Media Access Control (MAC) address—usually stored in the controller's permanent memory. To avoid address conflicts between network devices, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) maintains and administers MAC address uniqueness. The size of an Ethernet MAC address is six octets. The three most significant octets are reserved to identify NIC manufacturers. These manufacturers, using only their assigned prefixes, uniquely assign the three least-significant octets of every Ethernet interface they produce.\nRepeaters and hubs\n[edit]A repeater is an electronic device that receives a network signal, cleans it of unnecessary noise and regenerates it. The signal is retransmitted at a higher power level, or to the other side of obstruction so that the signal can cover longer distances without degradation. In most twisted-pair Ethernet configurations, repeaters are required for cable that runs longer than 100 meters. With fiber optics, repeaters can be tens or even hundreds of kilometers apart.\nRepeaters work on the physical layer of the OSI model but still require a small amount of time to regenerate the signal. This can cause a propagation delay that affects network performance and may affect proper function. As a result, many network architectures limit the number of repeaters used in a network, e.g., the Ethernet 5-4-3 rule.\nAn Ethernet repeater with multiple ports is known as an Ethernet hub. In addition to reconditioning and distributing network signals, a repeater hub assists with collision detection and fault isolation for the network. Hubs and repeaters in LANs have been largely obsoleted by modern network switches.\nBridges and switches\n[edit]Network bridges and network switches are distinct from a hub in that they only forward frames to the ports involved in the communication whereas a hub forwards to all ports.[63] Bridges only have two ports but a switch can be thought of as a multi-port bridge. Switches normally have numerous ports, facilitating a star topology for devices, and for cascading additional switches.\nBridges and switches operate at the data link layer (layer 2) of the OSI model and bridge traffic between two or more network segments to form a single local network. Both are devices that forward frames of data between ports based on the destination MAC address in each frame.[64] They learn the association of physical ports to MAC addresses by examining the source addresses of received frames and only forward the frame when necessary. If an unknown destination MAC is targeted, the device broadcasts the request to all ports except the source, and discovers the location from the reply.\nBridges and switches divide the network's collision domain but maintain a single broadcast domain. Network segmentation through bridging and switching helps break down a large, congested network into an aggregation of smaller, more efficient networks.\nRouters\n[edit]A router is an internetworking device that forwards packets between networks by processing the addressing or routing information included in the packet. The routing information is often processed in conjunction with the routing table. A router uses its routing table to determine where to forward packets and does not require broadcasting packets which is inefficient for very big networks.\nModems\n[edit]Modems (modulator-demodulator) are used to connect network nodes via wire not originally designed for digital network traffic, or for wireless. To do this one or more carrier signals are modulated by the digital signal to produce an analog signal that can be tailored to give the required properties for transmission. Early modems modulated audio signals sent over a standard voice telephone line. Modems are still commonly used for telephone lines, using a digital subscriber line technology and cable television systems using DOCSIS technology.\nFirewalls\n[edit]A firewall is a network device or software for controlling network security and access rules. Firewalls are inserted in connections between secure internal networks and potentially insecure external networks such as the Internet. Firewalls are typically configured to reject access requests from unrecognized sources while allowing actions from recognized ones. The vital role firewalls play in network security grows in parallel with the constant increase in cyber attacks.\nCommunication protocols\n[edit]A communication protocol is a set of rules for exchanging information over a network. Communication protocols have various characteristics. They may be connection-oriented or connectionless, they may use circuit mode or packet switching, and they may use hierarchical addressing or flat addressing.\nIn a protocol stack, often constructed per the OSI model, communications functions are divided up into protocol layers, where each layer leverages the services of the layer below it until the lowest layer controls the hardware that sends information across the media. The use of protocol layering is ubiquitous across the field of computer networking. An important example of a protocol stack is HTTP (the World Wide Web protocol) running over TCP over IP (the Internet protocols) over IEEE 802.11 (the Wi-Fi protocol). This stack is used between the wireless router and the home user's personal computer when the user is surfing the web.\nThere are many communication protocols, a few of which are described below.\nCommon protocols\n[edit]Internet protocol suite\n[edit]The Internet protocol suite, also called TCP/IP, is the foundation of all modern networking. It offers connection-less and connection-oriented services over an inherently unreliable network traversed by datagram transmission using Internet protocol (IP). At its core, the protocol suite defines the addressing, identification, and routing specifications for Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) and for IPv6, the next generation of the protocol with a much enlarged addressing capability. The Internet protocol suite is the defining set of protocols for the Internet.[65]\nIEEE 802\n[edit]IEEE 802 is a family of IEEE standards dealing with local area networks and metropolitan area networks. The complete IEEE 802 protocol suite provides a diverse set of networking capabilities. The protocols have a flat addressing scheme. They operate mostly at layers 1 and 2 of the OSI model.\nFor example, MAC bridging (IEEE 802.1D) deals with the routing of Ethernet packets using a Spanning Tree Protocol. IEEE 802.1Q describes VLANs, and IEEE 802.1X defines a port-based network access control protocol, which forms the basis for the authentication mechanisms used in VLANs[66] (but it is also found in WLANs[67]) – it is what the home user sees when the user has to enter a \"wireless access key\".\nEthernet\n[edit]Ethernet is a family of technologies used in wired LANs. It is described by a set of standards together called IEEE 802.3 published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.\nWireless LAN\n[edit]Wireless LAN based on the IEEE 802.11 standards, also widely known as WLAN or WiFi, is probably the most well-known member of the IEEE 802 protocol family for home users today. IEEE 802.11 shares many properties with wired Ethernet.\nSONET/SDH\n[edit]Synchronous optical networking (SONET) and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) are standardized multiplexing protocols that transfer multiple digital bit streams over optical fiber using lasers. They were originally designed to transport circuit mode communications from a variety of different sources, primarily to support circuit-switched digital telephony. However, due to its protocol neutrality and transport-oriented features, SONET/SDH also was the obvious choice for transporting Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) frames.\nAsynchronous Transfer Mode\n[edit]Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is a switching technique for telecommunication networks. It uses asynchronous time-division multiplexing and encodes data into small, fixed-sized cells. This differs from other protocols such as the Internet protocol suite or Ethernet that use variable-sized packets or frames. ATM has similarities with both circuit and packet switched networking. This makes it a good choice for a network that must handle both traditional high-throughput data traffic, and real-time, low-latency content such as voice and video. ATM uses a connection-oriented model in which a virtual circuit must be established between two endpoints before the actual data exchange begins.\nATM still plays a role in the last mile, which is the connection between an Internet service provider and the home user.[68][needs update]\nCellular standards\n[edit]There are a number of different digital cellular standards, including: Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), cdmaOne, CDMA2000, Evolution-Data Optimized (EV-DO), Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT), Digital AMPS (IS-136/TDMA), and Integrated Digital Enhanced Network (iDEN).[69]\nRouting\n[edit]Routing is the process of selecting network paths to carry network traffic. Routing is performed for many kinds of networks, including circuit switching networks and packet switched networks.\nIn packet-switched networks, routing protocols direct packet forwarding through intermediate nodes. Intermediate nodes are typically network hardware devices such as routers, bridges, gateways, firewalls, or switches. General-purpose computers can also forward packets and perform routing, though because they lack specialized hardware, may offer limited performance. The routing process directs forwarding on the basis of routing tables, which maintain a record of the routes to various network destinations. Most routing algorithms use only one network path at a time. Multipath routing techniques enable the use of multiple alternative paths.\nRouting can be contrasted with bridging in its assumption that network addresses are structured and that similar addresses imply proximity within the network. Structured addresses allow a single routing table entry to represent the route to a group of devices. In large networks, the structured addressing used by routers outperforms unstructured addressing used by bridging. Structured IP addresses are used on the Internet. Unstructured MAC addresses are used for bridging on Ethernet and similar local area networks.\nGeographic scale\n[edit]Networks may be characterized by many properties or features, such as physical capacity, organizational purpose, user authorization, access rights, and others. Another distinct classification method is that of the physical extent or geographic scale.\nNanoscale network\n[edit]A nanoscale network has key components implemented at the nanoscale, including message carriers, and leverages physical principles that differ from macroscale communication mechanisms. Nanoscale communication extends communication to very small sensors and actuators such as those found in biological systems and also tends to operate in environments that would be too harsh for other communication techniques.[70]\nPersonal area network\n[edit]A personal area network (PAN) is a computer network used for communication among computers and different information technological devices close to one person. Some examples of devices that are used in a PAN are personal computers, printers, fax machines, telephones, PDAs, scanners, and video game consoles. A PAN may include wired and wireless devices. The reach of a PAN typically extends to 10 meters.[71] A wired PAN is usually constructed with USB and FireWire connections while technologies such as Bluetooth and infrared communication typically form a wireless PAN.\nLocal area network\n[edit]A local area network (LAN) is a network that connects computers and devices in a limited geographical area such as a home, school, office building, or closely positioned group of buildings. Wired LANs are most commonly based on Ethernet technology. Other networking technologies such as ITU-T G.hn also provide a way to create a wired LAN using existing wiring, such as coaxial cables, telephone lines, and power lines.[72]\nA LAN can be connected to a wide area network (WAN) using a router. The defining characteristics of a LAN, in contrast to a WAN, include higher data transfer rates, limited geographic range, and lack of reliance on leased lines to provide connectivity.[citation needed] Current Ethernet or other IEEE 802.3 LAN technologies operate at data transfer rates up to and in excess of 100 Gbit/s,[73] standardized by IEEE in 2010.\nHome area network\n[edit]A home area network (HAN) is a residential LAN used for communication between digital devices typically deployed in the home, usually a small number of personal computers and accessories, such as printers and mobile computing devices. An important function is the sharing of Internet access, often a broadband service through a cable Internet access or digital subscriber line (DSL) provider.\nStorage area network\n[edit]A storage area network (SAN) is a dedicated network that provides access to consolidated, block-level data storage. SANs are primarily used to make storage devices, such as disk arrays, tape libraries, and optical jukeboxes, accessible to servers so that the storage appears as locally attached devices to the operating system. A SAN typically has its own network of storage devices that are generally not accessible through the local area network by other devices. The cost and complexity of SANs dropped in the early 2000s to levels allowing wider adoption across both enterprise and small to medium-sized business environments.[citation needed]\nCampus area network\n[edit]A campus area network (CAN) is made up of an interconnection of LANs within a limited geographical area. The networking equipment (switches, routers) and transmission media (optical fiber, Cat5 cabling, etc.) are almost entirely owned by the campus tenant or owner (an enterprise, university, government, etc.).\nFor example, a university campus network is likely to link a variety of campus buildings to connect academic colleges or departments, the library, and student residence halls.\nBackbone network\n[edit]A backbone network is part of a computer network infrastructure that provides a path for the exchange of information between different LANs or subnetworks. A backbone can tie together diverse networks within the same building, across different buildings, or over a wide area. When designing a network backbone, network performance and network congestion are critical factors to take into account. Normally, the backbone network's capacity is greater than that of the individual networks connected to it.\nFor example, a large company might implement a backbone network to connect departments that are located around the world. The equipment that ties together the departmental networks constitutes the network backbone. Another example of a backbone network is the Internet backbone, which is a massive, global system of fiber-optic cable and optical networking that carry the bulk of data between wide area networks (WANs), metro, regional, national and transoceanic networks.\nMetropolitan area network\n[edit]A metropolitan area network (MAN) is a large computer network that interconnects users with computer resources in a geographic region of the size of a metropolitan area.\nWide area network\n[edit]A wide area network (WAN) is a computer network that covers a large geographic area such as a city, country, or spans even intercontinental distances. A WAN uses a communications channel that combines many types of media such as telephone lines, cables, and airwaves. A WAN often makes use of transmission facilities provided by common carriers, such as telephone companies. WAN technologies generally function at the lower three layers of the OSI model: the physical layer, the data link layer, and the network layer.\nEnterprise private network\n[edit]An enterprise private network is a network that a single organization builds to interconnect its office locations (e.g., production sites, head offices, remote offices, shops) so they can share computer resources.\nVirtual private network\n[edit]A virtual private network (VPN) is an overlay network in which some of the links between nodes are carried by open connections or virtual circuits in some larger network (e.g., the Internet) instead of by physical wires. The data link layer protocols of the virtual network are said to be tunneled through the larger network. One common application is secure communications through the public Internet, but a VPN need not have explicit security features, such as authentication or content encryption. VPNs, for example, can be used to separate the traffic of different user communities over an underlying network with strong security features.\nVPN may have best-effort performance or may have a defined service level agreement (SLA) between the VPN customer and the VPN service provider.\nGlobal area network\n[edit]A global area network (GAN) is a network used for supporting mobile users across an arbitrary number of wireless LANs, satellite coverage areas, etc. The key challenge in mobile communications is handing off communications from one local coverage area to the next. In IEEE Project 802, this involves a succession of terrestrial wireless LANs.[74]\nOrganizational scope\n[edit]Networks are typically managed by the organizations that own them. Private enterprise networks may use a combination of intranets and extranets. They may also provide network access to the Internet, which has no single owner and permits virtually unlimited global connectivity.\nIntranet\n[edit]An intranet is a set of networks that are under the control of a single administrative entity. An intranet typically uses the Internet Protocol and IP-based tools such as web browsers and file transfer applications. The administrative entity limits the use of the intranet to its authorized users. Most commonly, an intranet is the internal LAN of an organization. A large intranet typically has at least one web server to provide users with organizational information.\nExtranet\n[edit]An extranet is a network that is under the administrative control of a single organization but supports a limited connection to a specific external network. For example, an organization may provide access to some aspects of its intranet to share data with its business partners or customers. These other entities are not necessarily trusted from a security standpoint. The network connection to an extranet is often, but not always, implemented via WAN technology.\nInternet\n[edit]An internetwork is the connection of multiple different types of computer networks to form a single computer network using higher-layer network protocols and connecting them together using routers.\nThe Internet is the largest example of internetwork. It is a global system of interconnected governmental, academic, corporate, public, and private computer networks. It is based on the networking technologies of the Internet protocol suite. It is the successor of the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) developed by DARPA of the United States Department of Defense. The Internet utilizes copper communications and an optical networking backbone to enable the World Wide Web (WWW), the Internet of things, video transfer, and a broad range of information services.\nParticipants on the Internet use a diverse array of methods of several hundred documented, and often standardized, protocols compatible with the Internet protocol suite and the IP addressing system administered by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority and address registries. Service providers and large enterprises exchange information about the reachability of their address spaces through the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), forming a redundant worldwide mesh of transmission paths.\nDarknet\n[edit]A darknet is an overlay network, typically running on the Internet, that is only accessible through specialized software. It is an anonymizing network where connections are made only between trusted peers — sometimes called friends (F2F)[76] — using non-standard protocols and ports.\nDarknets are distinct from other distributed peer-to-peer networks as sharing is anonymous (that is, IP addresses are not publicly shared), and therefore users can communicate with little fear of governmental or corporate interference.[77]\nNetwork service\n[edit]Network services are applications hosted by servers on a computer network, to provide some functionality for members or users of the network, or to help the network itself to operate.\nThe World Wide Web, E-mail,[78] printing and network file sharing are examples of well-known network services. Network services such as Domain Name System (DNS) give names for IP and MAC addresses (people remember names like nm.lan better than numbers like 210.121.67.18),[79] and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to ensure that the equipment on the network has a valid IP address.[80]\nServices are usually based on a service protocol that defines the format and sequencing of messages between clients and servers of that network service.\nNetwork performance\n[edit]Bandwidth\n[edit]Bandwidth in bit/s may refer to consumed bandwidth, corresponding to achieved throughput or goodput, i.e., the average rate of successful data transfer through a communication path. The throughput is affected by processes such as bandwidth shaping, bandwidth management, bandwidth throttling, bandwidth cap and bandwidth allocation (using, for example, bandwidth allocation protocol and dynamic bandwidth allocation).\nNetwork delay\n[edit]Network delay is a design and performance characteristic of a telecommunications network. It specifies the latency for a bit of data to travel across the network from one communication endpoint to another. Delay may differ slightly, depending on the location of the specific pair of communicating endpoints. Engineers usually report both the maximum and average delay, and they divide the delay into several components, the sum of which is the total delay:\n- Processing delay – time it takes a router to process the packet header\n- Queuing delay – time the packet spends in routing queues\n- Transmission delay – time it takes to push the packet's bits onto the link\n- Propagation delay – time for a signal to propagate through the media\nA certain minimum level of delay is experienced by signals due to the time it takes to transmit a packet serially through a link. This delay is extended by more variable levels of delay due to network congestion. IP network delays can range from less than a microsecond to several hundred milliseconds.\nPerformance metrics\n[edit]The parameters that affect performance typically can include throughput, jitter, bit error rate and latency.\nIn circuit-switched networks, network performance is synonymous with the grade of service. The number of rejected calls is a measure of how well the network is performing under heavy traffic loads.[81] Other types of performance measures can include the level of noise and echo.\nIn an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network, performance can be measured by line rate, quality of service (QoS), data throughput, connect time, stability, technology, modulation technique, and modem enhancements.[82][verification needed][full citation needed]\nThere are many ways to measure the performance of a network, as each network is different in nature and design. Performance can also be modeled instead of measured. For example, state transition diagrams are often used to model queuing performance in a circuit-switched network. The network planner uses these diagrams to analyze how the network performs in each state, ensuring that the network is optimally designed.[83]\nNetwork congestion\n[edit]Network congestion occurs when a link or node is subjected to a greater data load than it is rated for, resulting in a deterioration of its quality of service. When networks are congested and queues become too full, packets have to be discarded, and participants must rely on retransmission to maintain reliable communications. Typical effects of congestion include queueing delay, packet loss or the blocking of new connections. A consequence of these latter two is that incremental increases in offered load lead either to only a small increase in the network throughput or to a potential reduction in network throughput.\nNetwork protocols that use aggressive retransmissions to compensate for packet loss tend to keep systems in a state of network congestion even after the initial load is reduced to a level that would not normally induce network congestion. Thus, networks using these protocols can exhibit two stable states under the same level of load. The stable state with low throughput is known as congestive collapse.\nModern networks use congestion control, congestion avoidance and traffic control techniques where endpoints typically slow down or sometimes even stop transmission entirely when the network is congested to try to avoid congestive collapse. Specific techniques include: exponential backoff in protocols such as 802.11's CSMA/CA and the original Ethernet, window reduction in TCP, and fair queueing in devices such as routers.\nAnother method to avoid the negative effects of network congestion is implementing quality of service priority schemes allowing selected traffic to bypass congestion. Priority schemes do not solve network congestion by themselves, but they help to alleviate the effects of congestion for critical services. A third method to avoid network congestion is the explicit allocation of network resources to specific flows. One example of this is the use of Contention-Free Transmission Opportunities (CFTXOPs) in the ITU-T G.hn home networking standard.\nFor the Internet, RFC 2914 addresses the subject of congestion control in detail.\nNetwork resilience\n[edit]Network resilience is \"the ability to provide and maintain an acceptable level of service in the face of faults and challenges to normal operation.\"[84]\nSecurity\n[edit]Computer networks are also used by security hackers to deploy computer viruses or computer worms on devices connected to the network, or to prevent these devices from accessing the network via a denial-of-service attack.\nNetwork security\n[edit]Network Security consists of provisions and policies adopted by the network administrator to prevent and monitor unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or denial of the computer network and its network-accessible resources.[85] Network security is used on a variety of computer networks, both public and private, to secure daily transactions and communications among businesses, government agencies, and individuals.\nNetwork surveillance\n[edit]Network surveillance is the monitoring of data being transferred over computer networks such as the Internet. The monitoring is often done surreptitiously and may be done by or at the behest of governments, by corporations, criminal organizations, or individuals. It may or may not be legal and may or may not require authorization from a court or other independent agency.\nComputer and network surveillance programs are widespread today, and almost all Internet traffic is or could potentially be monitored for clues to illegal activity.\nSurveillance is very useful to governments and law enforcement to maintain social control, recognize and monitor threats, and prevent or investigate criminal activity. With the advent of programs such as the Total Information Awareness program, technologies such as high-speed surveillance computers and biometrics software, and laws such as the Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act, governments now possess an unprecedented ability to monitor the activities of citizens.[86]\nHowever, many civil rights and privacy groups—such as Reporters Without Borders, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and the American Civil Liberties Union—have expressed concern that increasing surveillance of citizens may lead to a mass surveillance society, with limited political and personal freedoms. Fears such as this have led to lawsuits such as Hepting v. AT&T.[86][87] The hacktivist group Anonymous has hacked into government websites in protest of what it considers \"draconian surveillance\".[88][89]\nEnd to end encryption\n[edit]End-to-end encryption (E2EE) is a digital communications paradigm of uninterrupted protection of data traveling between two communicating parties. It involves the originating party encrypting data so only the intended recipient can decrypt it, with no dependency on third parties. End-to-end encryption prevents intermediaries, such as Internet service providers or application service providers, from reading or tampering with communications. End-to-end encryption generally protects both confidentiality and integrity.\nExamples of end-to-end encryption include HTTPS for web traffic, PGP for email, OTR for instant messaging, ZRTP for telephony, and TETRA for radio.\nTypical server-based communications systems do not include end-to-end encryption. These systems can only guarantee the protection of communications between clients and servers, not between the communicating parties themselves. Examples of non-E2EE systems are Google Talk, Yahoo Messenger, Facebook, and Dropbox.\nThe end-to-end encryption paradigm does not directly address risks at the endpoints of the communication themselves, such as the technical exploitation of clients, poor quality random number generators, or key escrow. E2EE also does not address traffic analysis, which relates to things such as the identities of the endpoints and the times and quantities of messages that are sent.\nSSL/TLS\n[edit]The introduction and rapid growth of e-commerce on the World Wide Web in the mid-1990s made it obvious that some form of authentication and encryption was needed. Netscape took the first shot at a new standard. At the time, the dominant web browser was Netscape Navigator. Netscape created a standard called secure socket layer (SSL). SSL requires a server with a certificate. When a client requests access to an SSL-secured server, the server sends a copy of the certificate to the client. The SSL client checks this certificate (all web browsers come with an exhaustive list of root certificates preloaded), and if the certificate checks out, the server is authenticated and the client negotiates a symmetric-key cipher for use in the session. The session is now in a very secure encrypted tunnel between the SSL server and the SSL client.[60]\nViews of networks\n[edit]Users and network administrators typically have different views of their networks. Users can share printers and some servers from a workgroup, which usually means they are in the same geographic location and are on the same LAN, whereas a network administrator is responsible for keeping that network up and running. A community of interest has less of a connection of being in a local area and should be thought of as a set of arbitrarily located users who share a set of servers, and possibly also communicate via peer-to-peer technologies.\nNetwork administrators can see networks from both physical and logical perspectives. The physical perspective involves geographic locations, physical cabling, and the network elements (e.g., routers, bridges and application-layer gateways) that interconnect via the transmission media. Logical networks, called, in the TCP/IP architecture, subnets, map onto one or more transmission media. For example, a common practice in a campus of buildings is to make a set of LAN cables in each building appear to be a common subnet, using VLANs.\nUsers and administrators are aware, to varying extents, of a network's trust and scope characteristics. Again using TCP/IP architectural terminology, an intranet is a community of interest under private administration usually by an enterprise, and is only accessible by authorized users (e.g. employees).[90] Intranets do not have to be connected to the Internet, but generally have a limited connection. An extranet is an extension of an intranet that allows secure communications to users outside of the intranet (e.g. business partners, customers).[90]\nUnofficially, the Internet is the set of users, enterprises, and content providers that are interconnected by Internet Service Providers (ISP). From an engineering viewpoint, the Internet is the set of subnets, and aggregates of subnets, that share the registered IP address space and exchange information about the reachability of those IP addresses using the Border Gateway Protocol. Typically, the human-readable names of servers are translated to IP addresses, transparently to users, via the directory function of the Domain Name System (DNS).\nOver the Internet, there can be business-to-business, business-to-consumer and consumer-to-consumer communications. When money or sensitive information is exchanged, the communications are apt to be protected by some form of communications security mechanism. Intranets and extranets can be securely superimposed onto the Internet, without any access by general Internet users and administrators, using secure VPN technology.\nSee also\n[edit]- Cloud computing\n- Cyberspace\n- History of the Internet\n- Information Age\n- ISO/IEC 11801 – International standard for electrical and optical cables\n- Network diagram software\n- Network mapping\n- Network on a chip\n- Network planning and design\n- Network simulation\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ Sterling, Christopher H., ed.

          "content": "Bond (finance)\nIn finance, a bond is a type of security under which the issuer (debtor) owes the holder (creditor) a debt, and is obliged – depending on the terms – to provide cash flow to the creditor (e.g. repay the principal (i.e. amount borrowed) of the bond at the maturity date and interest (called the coupon) over a specified amount of time.[1]) The timing and the amount of cash flow provided varies, depending on the economic value that is emphasized upon, thus giving rise to different types of bonds.[1] The interest is usually payable at fixed intervals: semiannual, annual, and less often at other periods. Thus, a bond is a form of loan or IOU. Bonds provide the borrower with external funds to finance long-term investments or, in the case of government bonds, to finance current expenditure.\nBonds and stocks are both securities, but the major difference between the two is that (capital) stockholders have an equity stake in a company (i.e. they are owners), whereas bondholders have a creditor stake in a company (i.e. they are lenders). As creditors, bondholders have priority over stockholders. This means they will be repaid in advance of stockholders, but will rank behind secured creditors, in the event of bankruptcy. Another difference is that bonds usually have a defined term, or maturity, after which the bond is redeemed, whereas stocks typically remain outstanding indefinitely. An exception is an irredeemable bond, which is a perpetuity, that is, a bond with no maturity. Certificates of deposit (CDs) or short-term commercial paper are classified as money market instruments and not bonds: the main difference is the length of the term of the instrument.\nThe most common forms include municipal, corporate, and government bonds. Very often the bond is negotiable, that is, the ownership of the instrument can be transferred in the secondary market. This means that once the transfer agents at the bank medallion-stamp the bond, it is highly liquid on the secondary market.[2] The price of a bond in the secondary market may differ substantially from the principal due to various factors in bond valuation.\nBonds are often identified by their international securities identification number, or ISIN, which is a 12-digit alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies debt securities.\nEtymology\n[edit]In English, the word \"bond\" relates to the etymology of \"bind\". The use of the word \"bond\" in this sense of an \"instrument binding one to pay a sum to another\" dates from at least the 1590s.[3][4]\nIssuance\n[edit]Bonds are issued by public authorities, credit institutions, companies and supranational institutions in the primary markets. The most common process for issuing bonds is through underwriting. When a bond issue is underwritten, one or more securities firms or banks, forming a syndicate, buy the entire issue of bonds from the issuer and resell them to investors. The security firm takes the risk of being unable to sell on the issue to end investors. Primary issuance is arranged by bookrunners who arrange the bond issue, have direct contact with investors and act as advisers to the bond issuer in terms of timing and price of the bond issue. The bookrunner is listed first among all underwriters participating in the issuance in the tombstone ads commonly used to announce bonds to the public. The bookrunners' willingness to underwrite must be discussed prior to any decision on the terms of the bond issue as there may be limited demand for the bonds.\nIn contrast, government bonds are usually issued in an auction. In some cases, both members of the public and banks may bid for bonds. In other cases, only market makers may bid for bonds. The overall rate of return on the bond depends on both the terms of the bond and the price paid.[5] The terms of the bond, such as the coupon, are fixed in advance and the price is determined by the market.\nIn the case of an underwritten bond, the underwriters will charge a fee for underwriting. An alternative process for bond issuance, which is commonly used for smaller issues and avoids this cost, is the private placement bond. Bonds sold directly to buyers may not be tradeable in the bond market.[6]\nHistorically, an alternative practice of issuance was for the borrowing government authority to issue bonds over a period of time, usually at a fixed price, with volumes sold on a particular day dependent on market conditions. This was called a tap issue or bond tap.\nFeatures\n[edit]Principal\n[edit]Nominal, principal, par, or face amount is the amount on which the issuer pays interest, and which, most commonly, has to be repaid at the end of the term. Some structured bonds can have a redemption amount which is different from the face amount and can be linked to the performance of particular assets.\nMaturity\n[edit]The issuer is obligated to repay the nominal amount on the maturity date. As long as all due payments have been made, the issuer has no further obligations to the bond holders after the maturity date. The length of time until the maturity date is often referred to as the term or tenor or maturity of a bond. The maturity can be any length of time, although debt securities with a term of less than one year are generally designated money market instruments rather than bonds. Most bonds have a term shorter than 30 years. Some bonds have been issued with terms of 50 years or more, and historically there have been some issues with no maturity date (irredeemable). In the market for United States Treasury securities, there are four categories of bond maturities:\n- short term (bills): maturities under one year;\n- medium term (notes): maturities between one and ten years;\n- long term (bonds): maturities between ten and thirty years;\n- perpetual: no maturity period.\nCoupon\n[edit]The coupon is the interest rate that the issuer pays to the holder. For fixed rate bonds, the coupon is fixed throughout the life of the bond. For floating rate notes, the coupon varies throughout the life of the bond and is based on the movement of a money market reference rate (historically this was generally LIBOR, but with its discontinuation the market reference rate has transitioned to SOFR).\nHistorically, coupons were physical attachments to the paper bond certificates, with each coupon representing an interest payment. On the interest due date, the bondholder would hand in the coupon to a bank in exchange for the interest payment. Today, interest payments are almost always paid electronically. Interest can be paid at different frequencies: generally semi-annual (every six months) or annual.\nYield\n[edit]The yield is the rate of return received from investing in the bond. It usually refers to one of the following:\n- The current yield, or running yield: the annual interest payment divided by the current market price of the bond (often the clean price).\n- The yield to maturity (or redemption yield, as it is termed in the United Kingdom) is an estimate of the total rate of return anticipated to be earned by an investor who buys a bond at a given market price, holds it to maturity, and receives all interest payments and the capital redemption on schedule.[7] It is a more useful measure of the return on a bond than current yield because it takes into account the present value of future interest payments and principal repaid at maturity. The yield to maturity or redemption yield calculated at the time of purchase is not necessarily the return the investor will actually earn, as finance scholars Dr. Annette Thau and Dr. Frank Fabozzi have noted. The yield to maturity will be realized only under certain conditions, including 1) all interest payments are reinvested rather than spent, and 2) all interest payments are reinvested at the yield to maturity calculated at the time the bond is purchased.[8][9] This distinction may not be a concern to bond buyers who intend to spend rather than reinvest the coupon payments, such as those practicing asset/liability matching strategies.\nCredit quality\n[edit]The quality of the issue refers to the probability that the bondholders will receive the amounts promised at the due dates. In other words, credit quality tells investors how likely the borrower is going to default. This will depend on a wide range of factors. High-yield bonds are bonds that are rated below investment grade by the credit rating agencies. As these bonds are riskier than investment grade bonds, investors expect to earn a higher yield. These bonds are also called junk bonds.\nMarket price\n[edit]The market price of a tradable bond will be influenced, among other factors, by the amounts, currency and timing of the interest payments and capital repayment due, the quality of the bond, and the available redemption yield of other comparable bonds which can be traded in the markets.\nThe price can be quoted as clean or dirty. \"Dirty\" includes the present value of all future cash flows, including accrued interest, and is most often used in Europe. \"Clean\" does not include accrued interest, and is most often used in the U.S.\nThe issue price at which investors buy the bonds when they are first issued will typically be approximately equal to the nominal amount. The net proceeds that the issuer receives are thus the issue price, less issuance fees. The market price of the bond will vary over its life: it may trade at a premium (above par, usually because market interest rates have fallen since issue), or at a discount (price below par, if market rates have risen or there is a high probability of default on the bond).\nOthers\n[edit]- Indentures and Covenants—An indenture is a formal debt agreement that establishes the terms of a bond issue, while covenants are the clauses of such an agreement. Covenants specify the rights of bondholders and the duties of issuers, such as actions that the issuer is obligated to perform or is prohibited from performing. In the U.S., federal and state securities and commercial laws apply to the enforcement of these agreements, which are construed by courts as contracts between issuers and bondholders. The terms may be changed only with great difficulty while the bonds are outstanding, with amendments to the governing document generally requiring approval by a majority (or super-majority) vote of the bondholders.\n- Optionality: Occasionally a bond may contain an embedded option; that is, it grants option-like features to the holder or the issuer:\n- Callability—Some bonds give the issuer the right to repay the bond before the maturity date on the call dates; see call option. These bonds are referred to as callable bonds. Most callable bonds allow the issuer to repay the bond at par. With some bonds, the issuer has to pay a premium, the so-called call premium. This is mainly the case for high-yield bonds. These have very strict covenants, restricting the issuer in its operations. To be free from these covenants, the issuer can repay the bonds early, but only at a high cost.\n- Puttability—Some bonds give the holder the right to force the issuer to repay the bond before the maturity date on the put dates; see put option. These are referred to as retractable or putable bonds.\n- Call dates and put dates—the dates on which callable and putable bonds can be redeemed early. There are four main categories:\n- A Bermudan callable has several call dates, usually coinciding with coupon dates.\n- A European callable has only one call date. This is a special case of a Bermudan callable.\n- An American callable can be called at any time until the maturity date.\n- A death put is an optional redemption feature on a debt instrument allowing the beneficiary of the estate of a deceased bondholder to put (sell) the bond back to the issuer at face value in the event of the bondholder's death or legal incapacitation. This is also known as a \"survivor's option\".\n- Sinking fund provision of the corporate bond indenture requires a certain portion of the issue to be retired periodically. The entire bond issue can be liquidated by the maturity date; if not, the remainder is called balloon maturity. Issuers may either pay to trustees, which in turn call randomly selected bonds in the issue, or, alternatively, purchase bonds in the open market, then return them to trustees.\nTypes\n[edit]Bonds can be categorised in several ways, such as the type of issuer, the currency, the term of the bond (length of time to maturity) and the conditions applying to the bond. The following descriptions are not mutually exclusive, and more than one of them may apply to a particular bond:\nThe nature of the issuer and the security offered\n[edit]The nature of the issuer will affect the security (certainty of receiving the contracted payments) offered by the bond, and sometimes the tax treatment.\n- Government bonds, often also called treasury bonds, are issued by a sovereign national government.[10] Some countries have repeatedly defaulted on their government bonds, while some other treasury bonds have been treated as risk-free and not exposed to default risk. Risk-free bonds are the safest bonds, with the lowest interest rate. A Treasury bond is backed by the \"full faith and credit\" of the relevant government. However, in reality most or all government bonds do carry some residual risk. This is indicated by\n- the award by rating agencies of a rating below the top rating,\n- bonds issued by different national governments, such as various member states of the European Union, all denominated in Euros, offering different market yields reflecting their different risks.\n- A supranational bond, also known as a \"supra\", is issued by a supranational organisation like the World Bank. They have a very good credit rating, similar to that on national government bonds.\n- A municipal bond issued by a local authority or subdivision within a country,[10] for example a city or a federal state. These will to varying degrees carry the backing of the national government. In the United States, such bonds are exempt from certain taxes. For example, Build America Bonds (BABs) are a form of municipal bond authorized by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Unlike traditional US municipal bonds, which are usually tax exempt, interest received on BABs is subject to federal taxation. However, as with municipal bonds, the bond is tax-exempt within the US state where it is issued. Generally, BABs offer significantly higher yields than standard municipal bonds.\n- A revenue bond is a special type of municipal bond distinguished by its guarantee of repayment solely from revenues generated by a specified revenue-generating entity associated with the purpose of the bonds. Revenue bonds are typically \"non-recourse\", meaning that in the event of default, the bond holder has no recourse to other governmental assets or revenues.\n- A War bond is a bond issued by a government to fund military operations and other expenditure during wartime. It will often have a low return rate, and so can be bought due a lack of opportunities or patriotism.\n- Corporate bonds are issued by corporations.[10]\n- High-yield bonds (junk bonds) are bonds that are rated below investment grade by the credit rating agencies, because they are uncertain that the issuer will be able or willing to pay the scheduled interest payments and/or redeem the bond at maturity. As these bonds are much riskier than investment grade bonds, investors expect to earn a much higher yield.\n- A Climate bond is a bond issued by a government or corporate entity in order to raise finance for climate change mitigation- or adaptation-related projects or programmes. For example, in 2021 the UK government started to issue \"green bonds\".\n- Asset-backed securities are bonds whose interest and principal payments are backed by underlying cash flows from other assets. Examples of asset-backed securities are mortgage-backed securities (MBSs), collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).\n- Covered bonds are backed by cash flows from mortgages or public sector assets. Unlike asset-backed securities, the assets for such bonds remain on the issuer's balance sheet.\n- Subordinated bonds are those that have a lower priority than other bonds of the issuer in case of liquidation. In case of bankruptcy, there is a hierarchy of creditors. First the liquidator is paid, then government taxes, etc. The first bond holders in line to be paid are those holding what are called senior bonds. After they have been paid, the subordinated bond holders are paid. As a result, the risk is higher. Therefore, subordinated bonds usually have a lower credit rating than senior bonds. The main examples of subordinated bonds can be found in bonds issued by banks and asset-backed securities. The latter are often issued in tranches. The senior tranches get paid back first, the subordinated tranches later.\n- Social impact bonds are an agreement for public sector entities to pay back private investors after meeting verified improved social outcome goals that result in public sector savings from innovative social program pilot projects.\nThe term of the bond\n[edit]- Most bonds are structured to mature on a stated date, when the principal is due to be repaid, and interest payments cease. Typically, a bond with term to maturity of under five years would be called a short bond; 5 to 15 years would be \"medium\", and over 15 years would be \"long\"; but the numbers may vary in different markets.\n- Perpetual bonds are also often called perpetuities or 'Perps'. They have no maturity date. Historically the most famous of these were the UK Consols (there were also some other perpetual UK government bonds, such as War Loan, Treasury Annuities and undated Treasuries). Some of these were issued back in 1888 or earlier. There had been insignificant quantities of these outstanding for decades, and they have now been fully repaid. Some ultra-long-term bonds (sometimes a bond can last centuries: West Shore Railroad issued a bond which matures in 2361 (i.e. 24th century)) are virtually perpetuities from a financial point of view, with the current value of principal near zero.\n- The Methuselah is a type of bond with a maturity of 50 years or longer.[11] The term is a reference to Methuselah, the oldest person whose age is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible. The issuance of Methuselahs has been increasing in recent years due to demand for longer-dated assets from pension plans, particularly in France and the United Kingdom. Issuance of Methuselahs in the United States has been limited, however: the U.S. Treasury does not currently issue Treasuries with maturities beyond 30 years, which would serve as a reference level for any corporate issuance.\n- A Serial bond is a bond that matures in installments over a period of time. For example, a $100,000, 5-year serial bond might pay $20,000 per year.\nThe conditions applying to the bond\n[edit]- Fixed rate bonds have interest payments (\"coupon\"), usually semi-annual, that remains constant throughout the life of the bond. Other variations include stepped-coupon bonds, whose coupon increases during the life of the bond.\n- Floating rate notes (FRNs, floaters) have a variable coupon that is linked to a reference rate of interest, such as Libor or Euribor. For example, the coupon may be defined as three-month USD LIBOR + 0.20%. The coupon rate is recalculated periodically, typically every one or three months.\n- Zero-coupon bonds (zeros) pay no regular interest. They are issued at a substantial discount to par value, so that the interest is effectively rolled up to maturity (and usually taxed as such). The bondholder receives the full principal amount on the redemption date. An example of zero coupon bonds is Series E savings bonds issued by the U.S. government. Zero-coupon bonds may be created from fixed rate bonds by a financial institution separating (\"stripping off\") the coupons from the principal. This can create a \"Principal Only\" zero-coupon bond and an \"Interest Only\" (IO) strip bond from the original fixed income bond.\n- Inflation-indexed bonds (linkers) (US) or index-linked bonds (UK), in which the principal amount and the interest payments are indexed to the level of consumer prices. The interest rate is normally lower than for fixed rate bonds with a comparable maturity (this relationship briefly reversed for short-term UK bonds in December 2008). Higher inflation rates increase the nominal principal and coupon amounts paid on these bonds. The United Kingdom was the first sovereign issuer to issue inflation-linked gilts in the 1980s. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and I-bonds are examples of inflation-linked bonds issued by the U.S. government.\n- Other indexed bonds, for example equity-linked notes and bonds indexed on a business indicator (income, added value) or on a country's GDP.\n- Lottery bonds are issued by European and other states. Interest is paid as on a traditional fixed rate bond, but the issuer will redeem randomly selected individual bonds within the issue according to a schedule. Some of these redemptions will be for a higher value than the face value of the bond.\nBonds with embedded options for the holder\n[edit]- Convertible bonds let a bondholder exchange a bond to a number of shares of the issuer's common stock. These are known as hybrid securities, because they combine equity and debt features.\n- Exchangeable bonds allows for exchange to shares of a corporation other than the issuer.\nDocumentation and evidence of title\n[edit]- A bearer bond is an official certificate issued without a named holder. In other words, the person who has the paper certificate can claim the value of the bond. Often they are registered by a number to prevent counterfeiting, but may be traded like cash. Bearer bonds are very risky because they can be lost or stolen, due to the fact that they can be claimed by whoever is in possession of them[12]. In some countries they were historically popular because the owner could not be traced by the tax authorities. For example, after federal income tax began in the United States, bearer bonds were seen as an opportunity to conceal income or assets.[13] U.S. corporations stopped issuing bearer bonds in the 1960s, the U.S. Treasury stopped in 1982, and state and local tax-exempt bearer bonds were prohibited in 1983.[14]\n- A registered bond is a bond whose ownership (and any subsequent purchaser) is recorded by the issuer, or by a transfer agent. Interest payments and the principal upon maturity are sent to the registered owner. The owner can continue to receive interest with a duplicated bond in case of a loss. However, the bond is not easily transferable to other people. Registered bonds seldom appeared in the market for trading. The traceability of the bonds means it has a minor effect on bond prices. Once a new owner acquired the bond, the old bond must be sent to the corporation or agent for cancellation and for issuance of a new bond.[1] It is the opposite of a bearer bond.\n- A book-entry bond is a bond that does not have a paper certificate. As physically processing paper bonds and interest coupons became more expensive, issuers (and banks that used to collect coupon interest for depositors) have tried to discourage their use. Some book-entry bond issues do not offer the option of a paper certificate, even to investors who prefer them.[15]\nRetail bonds\n[edit]- Retail bonds are a type of corporate bond mostly designed for ordinary investors.[16]\nForeign currencies\n[edit]Some companies, banks, governments, and other sovereign entities may decide to issue bonds in foreign currencies as the foreign currency may appear to potential investors to be more stable and predictable than their domestic currency. Issuing bonds denominated in foreign currencies also gives issuers the ability to access investment capital available in foreign markets.\nA downside is that the government loses the option to reduce its bond liabilities by inflating its domestic currency.\nThe proceeds from the issuance of these bonds can be used by companies to break into foreign markets, or can be converted into the issuing company's local currency to be used on existing operations through the use of foreign exchange swap hedges. Foreign issuer bonds can also be used to hedge foreign exchange rate risk. Some foreign issuer bonds are called by their nicknames, such as the \"samurai bond\". These can be issued by foreign issuers looking to diversify their investor base away from domestic markets. These bond issues are generally governed by the law of the market of issuance, e.g., a samurai bond, issued by an investor based in Europe, will be governed by Japanese law. Not all of the following bonds are restricted for purchase by investors in the market of issuance.\nBond valuation\n[edit]The market price of a bond is the present value of all expected future interest and principal payments of the bond, here discounted at the bond's yield to maturity (i.e. rate of return). That relationship is the definition of the redemption yield on the bond, which is likely to be close to the current market interest rate for other bonds with similar characteristics, as otherwise there would be arbitrage opportunities. The yield and price of a bond are inversely related so that when market interest rates rise, bond prices fall and vice versa. For a discussion of the mathematics see Bond valuation.\nThe bond's market price is usually expressed as a percentage of nominal value: 100% of face value, \"at par\", corresponds to a price of 100; prices can be above par (bond is priced at greater than 100), which is called trading at a premium, or below par (bond is priced at less than 100), which is called trading at a discount. The market price of a bond may be quoted including the accrued interest since the last coupon date. (Some bond markets include accrued interest in the trading price and others add it on separately when settlement is made.) The price including accrued interest is known as the \"full\" or \"dirty price\". (See also Accrual bond.) The price excluding accrued interest is known as the \"flat\" or \"clean price\".\nMost government bonds are denominated in units of $1000 in the United States, or in units of £100 in the United Kingdom. Hence, a deep discount US bond, selling at a price of 75.26, indicates a selling price of $752.60 per bond sold. (Often, in the US, bond prices are quoted in points and thirty-seconds of a point, rather than in decimal form.) Some short-term bonds, such as the U.S. Treasury bill, are always issued at a discount, and pay par amount at maturity rather than paying coupons. This is called a discount bond.\nAlthough bonds are not necessarily issued at par (100% of face value, corresponding to a price of 100), their prices will move towards par as they approach maturity (if the market expects the maturity payment to be made in full and on time) as this is the price the issuer will pay to redeem the bond. This is referred to as \"pull to par\". At the time of issue of the bond, the coupon paid, and other conditions of the bond, will have been influenced by a variety of factors, such as current market interest rates, the length of the term and the creditworthiness of the issuer. These factors are likely to change over time, so the market price of a bond will vary after it is issued. (The position is a bit more complicated for inflation-linked bonds.)\nThe interest payment (\"coupon payment\") divided by the current price of the bond is called the current yield (this is the nominal yield multiplied by the par value and divided by the price). There are other yield measures that exist such as the yield to first call, yield to worst, yield to first par call, yield to put, cash flow yield and yield to maturity. The relationship between yield and term to maturity (or alternatively between yield and the weighted mean term allowing for both interest and capital repayment) for otherwise identical bonds derives the yield curve, a graph plotting this relationship.\nIf the bond includes embedded options, the valuation is more difficult and combines option pricing with discounting. Depending on the type of option, the option price as calculated is either added to or subtracted from the price of the \"straight\" portion. See further under Bond option § Embedded options. This total is then the value of the bond. More sophisticated lattice- or simulation-based techniques may (also) be employed.\nBond markets, unlike stock or share markets, sometimes do not have a centralized exchange or trading system. Rather, in most developed bond markets such as the U.S., Japan and western Europe, bonds trade in decentralized, dealer-based over-the-counter markets. In such a market, liquidity is provided by dealers and other market participants committing risk capital to trading activity. In the bond market, when an investor buys or sells a bond, the counterparty to the trade is almost always a bank or securities firm acting as a dealer. In some cases, when a dealer buys a bond from an investor, the dealer carries the bond \"in inventory\", i.e. holds it for their own account. The dealer is then subject to risks of price fluctuation. In other cases, the dealer immediately resells the bond to another investor.\nInvesting in bonds\n[edit]Bonds are bought and traded mostly by institutions like central banks, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, insurance companies, hedge funds, and banks. Insurance companies and pension funds have liabilities which essentially include fixed amounts payable on predetermined dates. They buy the bonds to match their liabilities, and may be compelled by law to do this. Most individuals who want to own bonds do so through bond funds. Still, in the U.S., nearly 10% of all bonds outstanding are held directly by households.\nThe volatility of bonds (especially short and medium dated bonds) is lower than that of equities (stocks). Thus, bonds are generally viewed as safer investments than equities, but this perception is only partially correct. Bonds do suffer from less day-to-day volatility than stocks, and bonds' interest payments are sometimes higher than the general level of dividend payments. Bonds are often liquid – it is often fairly easy for an institution to sell a large quantity of bonds without affecting the price much, which may be more difficult for equities – and the comparative certainty of a fixed interest payment twice a year and a fixed lump sum at maturity is attractive. Bondholders also enjoy a measure of legal protection: under the law of most countries, if a company goes bankrupt, its bondholders will often receive some money back (the recovery amount), whereas the company's equity stock often ends up valueless. However, bonds can also be risky but less risky than stocks:\n- Fixed rate bonds are subject to interest rate risk, meaning that their market prices will decrease in value when the generally prevailing interest rates rise. Since the payments are fixed, a decrease in the market price of the bond means an increase in its yield. When the market interest rate rises, the market price of bonds will fall, reflecting investors' ability to get a higher interest rate on their money elsewhere—perhaps by purchasing a newly issued bond that already features the newly higher interest rate. This does not affect the interest payments to the bondholder, so long-term investors who want a specific amount at the maturity date do not need to worry about price swings in their bonds and do not suffer from interest rate risk.\nBonds are also subject to various other risks such as call and prepayment risk, credit risk, reinvestment risk, liquidity risk, event risk, exchange rate risk, volatility risk, inflation risk, sovereign risk and yield curve risk. Again, some of these will only affect certain classes of investors.\nPrice changes in a bond will immediately affect mutual funds that hold these bonds. If the value of the bonds in their trading portfolio falls, the value of the portfolio also falls. This can be damaging for professional investors such as banks, insurance companies, pension funds and asset managers (irrespective of whether the value is immediately \"marked to market\" or not). If there is any chance a holder of individual bonds may need to sell their bonds and \"cash out\", interest rate risk could become a real problem, conversely, bonds' market prices would increase if the prevailing interest rate were to drop, as it did from 2001 through 2003. One way to quantify the interest rate risk on a bond is in terms of its duration. Efforts to control this risk are called immunization or hedging.\n- Bond prices can become volatile depending on the credit rating of the issuer – for instance if the credit rating agencies like Standard & Poor's and Moody's upgrade or downgrade the credit rating of the issuer. An unanticipated downgrade will cause the market price of the bond to fall. As with interest rate risk, this risk does not affect the bond's interest payments (provided the issuer does not actually default), but puts at risk the market price, which affects mutual funds holding these bonds, and holders of individual bonds who may have to sell them.\n- A company's bondholders may lose much or all their money if the company goes bankrupt. Under the laws of many countries (including the United States and Canada), bondholders are in line to receive the proceeds of the sale of the assets of a liquidated company ahead of some other creditors. Bank lenders, deposit holders (in the case of a deposit taking institution such as a bank) and trade creditors may take precedence.\nThere is no guarantee of how much money will remain to repay bondholders. As an example, after an accounting scandal and a Chapter 11 bankruptcy at the giant telecommunications company Worldcom, in 2004 its bondholders ended up being paid 35.7 cents on the dollar.[17] In a bankruptcy involving reorganization or recapitalization, as opposed to liquidation, bondholders may end up having the value of their bonds reduced, often through an exchange for a smaller number of newly issued bonds.\n- Some bonds are callable, meaning that even though the company has agreed to make payments plus interest towards the debt for a certain period of time, the company can choose to pay off the bond early. This creates reinvestment risk, meaning the investor is forced to find a new place for their money, and the investor might not be able to find as good a deal, especially because this usually happens when interest rates are falling.\nBond indices\n[edit]A number of bond indices exist for the purposes of managing portfolios and measuring performance, similar to the S&P 500 or Russell Indexes for companies' shares. The most common American benchmarks are the Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate (ex Lehman Aggregate), Citigroup BIG and Merrill Lynch Domestic Master. Most indices are parts of families of broader indices that can be used to measure global bond portfolios, or may be further subdivided by maturity or sector for managing specialized portfolios.\nSee also\n[edit]- Bond credit rating\n- Collective action clause\n- Debenture\n- Deferred financing costs\n- GDP-linked bond\n- Government bond/Sovereign bonds\n- Immunization (finance)\n- Promissory note\n- Short-rate model\n- Penal bond\n- Structured note\n- Syndicated lending\nMarket specific\nGeneral\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ a b c Chorafas, Dimitris N (2005).

          "description": "A bond is a fixed-income investment that represents a loan made by an investor to a borrower, usually corporate or governmental.",
          "content": "What Is a Bond?\nA bond is a fixed-income instrument and investment product where individuals lend money to a government or company at a certain interest rate for an amount of time. The entity repays individuals with interest in addition to the original face value of the bond.\nBonds are used by companies, municipalities, states, and sovereign governments to finance projects and operations. Owners of bonds are debtholders, or creditors, of the issuer. Bond details include the end date when the principal of the loan is due to be paid to the bond owner and usually include the terms for variable or fixed interest payments made by the borrower.\nKey Takeaways\n- A bond is referred to as a fixed-income instrument since bonds traditionally pay a fixed interest rate or coupon to debtholders.\n- Bond prices are inversely correlated with interest rates: when rates go up, bond prices fall, and vice-versa.\n- Bonds have maturity dates at which point the principal amount must be paid back in full or risk default.\nHow Bonds Work\nBonds are debt instruments and represent loans made to the issuer. Bonds allow individual investors to assume the role of the lender. Governments and corporations commonly use bonds to borrow money to fund roads, schools, dams, or other infrastructure. Corporations often borrow to grow their business, buy property and equipment, undertake profitable projects, for research and development, or to hire employees.\nBonds are fixed-income securities and are one of the main asset classes for individual investors, along with equities and cash equivalents. The borrower issues a bond that includes the terms of the loan, interest payments that will be made, and the maturity date the bond principal must be paid back. The interest payment is part of the return that bondholders earn for loaning their funds to the issuer. The interest rate that determines the payment is called the coupon rate.\nThe initial price of most bonds is typically set at par or $1,000 face value per individual bond. The actual market price of a bond depends on the credit quality of the issuer, the length of time until expiration, and the coupon rate compared to the general interest rate environment. The face value of the bond is what is paid to the lender once the bond matures.\nFast Fact\nMarkets allow lenders to sell their bonds to other investors or to buy bonds from other individuals—long after the original issuing organization raised capital. A bond investor does not have to hold a bond through to its maturity date.\nCharacteristics of Bonds\n- Face value or Par Value: The value of the bond at maturity and the reference amount the bond issuer uses when calculating interest payments.\n- Coupon Rate: The rate of interest the bond issuer will pay on the face value of the bond, expressed as a percentage.\n- Coupon Dates: The dates on which the bond issuer will make interest payments.\n- Maturity Date: The date on which the bond will mature and the bond issuer will pay the bondholder the face value of the bond.\n- Issue Price: The price at which the bond issuer originally sells the bonds. In many cases, bonds are issued at par.\nBond Categories\nThere are four primary categories of bonds sold in the markets. However, you may also see foreign bonds issued by global corporations and governments on some platforms.\n- Corporate Bonds: Companies issue corporate bonds rather than seek bank loans for debt financing because bond markets offer more favorable terms and lower interest rates.\n- Municipal Bonds: Issued by states and municipalities. Some municipal bonds offer tax-free coupon income for investors.\n- Government Bonds: Bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury with a year or less to maturity are called “Bills,” bonds issued with one–10 years to maturity are called “notes,” and government bonds issued with more than 10 years to maturity are called “bonds.” The entire category of bonds issued by a government treasury is often collectively referred to as \"treasuries.\"\n- Agency Bonds: Issued by government-affiliated organizations such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac are considered agency bonds.\nBond Prices and Interest Rates\nA bond's price changes daily where supply and demand determine that observed price. If an investor holds a bond to maturity they will get their principal back plus interest. However, a bondholder can sell their bonds in the open market, where the price can fluctuate. a bond’s price varies inversely with interest rates. When interest rates go up, bond prices fall to have the effect of equalizing the interest rate on the bond with prevailing rates, and vice versa.\nThe issuer of a fixed-rate bond promises to pay a coupon based on the face value of the bond. For a $1,000 par, 10% annual coupon bond, the issuer will pay the bondholder $100 each year. If prevailing market interest rates are also 10% at the time that this bond is issued, an investor would be indifferent to investing in the corporate bond or the government bond since both would return $100. However, if interest rates drop to 5%, the investor can only receive $50 from the government bond but would still receive $100 from the corporate bond.\nInvestors bid up to the price of the bond until it trades at a premium that equalizes the prevailing interest rate environment—in this case, the bond will trade at $2,000 so that the $100 coupon represents 5%. Likewise, if interest rates soared to 15%, then an investor could make $150 from the government bond and would not pay $1,000 to earn just $100. This bond would be sold until it reached a price that equalized the yields, in this case to a price of $666.67.\nYield-to-Maturity (YTM)\nThe yield-to-maturity (YTM) is the total return anticipated on a bond if the bond is held until the end of its lifetime. Yield to maturity is considered a long-term bond yield but is expressed as an annual rate.\nYTM is the internal rate of return of an investment in a bond if the investor holds the bond until maturity and if all payments are made as scheduled. YTM evaluates the attractiveness of one bond relative to other bonds of different coupons and maturity in the market. The formula for YTM involves solving for the interest rate.\nInvestors can measure the anticipated changes in bond prices given a change in interest rates with the duration of a bond. Duration represents the price change in a bond given a 1% change in interest rates. This practical definition is the modified duration of a bond. Bonds with long maturities, and also bonds with low coupons have the greatest sensitivity to interest rate changes.\nHow To Invest in Bonds\nWhile there are some specialized bond brokers, most online and discount brokers offer access to bond markets, and investors can buy them like stocks. Treasury bonds and TIPS are typically sold directly via the federal government and can be purchased via its TreasuryDirect website. Investors can also buy bonds indirectly via fixed-income ETFs or mutual funds that invest in a portfolio of bonds. Investors can also take a look at Investopedia's list of the best online stock brokers.\nBond Variations\nThe bonds available for investors come in many different varieties, depending on the rate or type of interest or coupon payment, by being recalled by the issuer, or because they have other attributes.\n- Zero-Coupon Bonds (Z-bonds): Do not pay coupon payments and instead are issued at a discount to their par value that will generate a return once the bondholder is paid the full face value when the bond matures. U.S. Treasury bills are zero-coupon bonds.\n- Convertible Bonds: Debt instruments with an embedded option that allows bondholders to convert their debt into stock (equity) at some point, depending on certain conditions like the share price.\n- Callable Bonds: Have an embedded option, but it is different than what is found in a convertible bond. A callable bond can be “called” back by the company before it matures. A callable bond is riskier for the bond buyer because the bond is more likely to be called when it is rising in value.\n- Puttable Bonds: allows the bondholders to put or sell the bond back to the company before it has matured. This is valuable for investors who are worried that a bond may fall in value or if they think interest rates will rise and they want to get their principal back before the bond falls in value. A puttable bond usually trades at a higher value than a bond without a put option but with the same credit rating, maturity, and coupon rate because it is more valuable to the bondholders.\nWhat Determines a Bond's Coupon Rate?\nTwo features of a bond—credit quality and time to maturity—are the principal determinants of a bond's coupon rate. If the issuer has a poor credit rating, the risk of default is greater, and these bonds pay more interest. Bonds that have a very long maturity date also usually pay a higher interest rate. This higher compensation is because the bondholder is more exposed to interest rate and inflation risks for an extended period.\nHow Are Bond's Rated?\nCredit ratings for a company and its bonds are generated by credit rating agencies like Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s, and Fitch Ratings. The very highest quality bonds are called “investment grade” and include debt issued by the U.S. government and very stable companies, such as many utilities. Bonds that are not considered investment grade but are not in default are called “high yield” or “junk” bonds. These bonds have a higher risk of default in the future and investors demand a higher coupon payment to compensate them for that risk.\nWhat Is Duration?\nBonds and bond portfolios will rise or fall in value as interest rates change. The sensitivity to changes in the interest rate environment is called “duration.” The use of the term duration in this context can be confusing to new bond investors because it does not refer to the length of time the bond has before maturity. Instead, duration describes how much a bond’s price will rise or fall with a change in interest rates.\nThe Bottom Line\nBonds are issued by companies and governments to finance projects and fund operations. A bond is considered a fixed-income instrument since bonds traditionally pay a fixed interest rate to debtholders. Investors can purchase corporate bonds through financial institutions or online brokers or buy government bonds through the U.S. Treasury website.",

          "content": "James Bond\nThe James Bond franchise focuses on the titular character, a fictional British Secret Service agent created in 1953 by writer Ian Fleming, who featured him in twelve novels and two short-story collections. Since Fleming's death in 1964, eight other authors have written authorised Bond novels or novelisations: Kingsley Amis, Christopher Wood, John Gardner, Raymond Benson, Sebastian Faulks, Jeffery Deaver, William Boyd, Anthony Horowitz and Charlie Higson. The latest novel is On His Majesty's Secret Service by Charlie Higson, published in May 2023. Additionally, Charlie Higson wrote a series on a young James Bond, and Kate Westbrook wrote three novels based on the diaries of a recurring series character, Moneypenny.\nThe character—also known by the code number 007 (pronounced \"double-oh-seven\")—has also been adapted for television, radio, comic strips, video games and film. The James Bond franchise is one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time. The films constitute one of the longest continually running film series and have grossed over US$7.04 billion in total at the box office, making James Bond the fifth-highest-grossing film series to date, which started in 1962 with Dr. No, starring Sean Connery as Bond. As of 2021[update], there have been twenty-five films in the Eon Productions series. The most recent Bond film, No Time to Die (2021), stars Daniel Craig in his fifth portrayal of Bond; he is the sixth actor to play Bond in the Eon series. There have also been two independent Bond film productions: Casino Royale (a 1967 spoof starring David Niven) and Never Say Never Again (a 1983 remake of an earlier Eon-produced film, 1965's Thunderball, both starring Connery). Casino Royale has also been adapted for television, as a one-hour show in 1954 as part of the CBS series Climax!.\nThe Bond films are renowned for a number of features, including their soundtracks, with the theme songs having received Academy Award nominations on several occasions, and three wins. Other important elements which run through most of the films include Bond's cars, his guns, and the gadgets with which he is supplied by Q Branch. The films are also noted for Bond's relationships with various women, who are popularly referred to as \"Bond girls\".\nPublication history\nCreation and inspiration\nIan Fleming created the fictional character of James Bond as the central figure for his works. Bond is an intelligence officer in the Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as MI6. Bond is known by his code number, 007, and was a Royal Naval Reserve Commander. Fleming based his fictional creation on a number of individuals he came across during his time in the Naval Intelligence Division and 30 Assault Unit during the Second World War, admitting that Bond \"was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war\".[3] Among those types were his brother, Peter, who had been involved in behind-the-lines operations in Norway and Greece during the war.[4] Aside from Fleming's brother, a number of others also provided some aspects of Bond's make up, including Conrad O'Brien-ffrench, Patrick Dalzel-Job, Bill \"Biffy\" Dunderdale and Duško Popov.[3][5]\nThe name James Bond came from that of the American ornithologist James Bond, a Caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive field guide Birds of the West Indies. Fleming, a keen birdwatcher himself, had a copy of Bond's guide and he later explained to the ornithologist's wife that \"It struck me that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born\".[6] He further explained that:\nWhen I wrote the first one in 1953, I wanted Bond to be an extremely dull, uninteresting man to whom things happened; I wanted him to be a blunt instrument ... when I was casting around for a name for my protagonist I thought by God, [James Bond] is the dullest name I ever heard.\n— Ian Fleming, The New Yorker, 21 April 1962[7]\nOn another occasion, Fleming said: \"I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, 'James Bond' was much better than something more interesting, like 'Peregrine Carruthers'. Exotic things would happen to and around him, but he would be a neutral figure—an anonymous, blunt instrument wielded by a government department.\"[8]\nFleming decided that Bond should resemble both American singer Hoagy Carmichael and himself[9] and in Casino Royale, Vesper Lynd remarks, \"Bond reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael, but there is something cold and ruthless.\" Likewise, in Moonraker, Special Branch officer Gala Brand thinks that Bond is \"certainly good-looking ... Rather like Hoagy Carmichael in a way. That black hair falling down over the right eyebrow. Much the same bones. But there was something a bit cruel in the mouth, and the eyes were cold.\"[9]\nFleming endowed Bond with many of his own traits, including sharing the same golf handicap, the taste for scrambled eggs, and using the same brand of toiletries.[10] Bond's tastes are also often taken from Fleming's own as was his behaviour,[11] with Bond's love of golf and gambling mirroring Fleming's own. Fleming used his experiences of his career in espionage and all other aspects of his life as inspiration when writing, including using names of school friends, acquaintances, relatives and lovers throughout his books.[3]\nIt was not until the penultimate novel, You Only Live Twice, that Fleming gave Bond a sense of family background. The book was the first to be written after the release of Dr. No in cinemas, and Sean Connery's depiction of Bond affected Fleming's interpretation of the character, henceforth giving Bond both a dry sense of humour and Scottish antecedents that were not present in the previous stories.[12] In a fictional obituary, purportedly published in The Times, Bond's parents were given as Andrew Bond, from the village of Glencoe, Scotland, and Monique Delacroix, from the canton of Vaud, Switzerland.[13] Fleming did not provide Bond's date of birth, but John Pearson's fictional biography of Bond, James Bond: The Authorized Biography of 007, gives Bond a birth date on 11 November 1920,[14] while a study by John Griswold puts the date at 11 November 1921.[15]\nNovels and related works\nIan Fleming novels\nWhilst serving in the Naval Intelligence Division, Fleming had planned to become an author;[17] he had told a friend, \"I am going to write the spy story to end all spy stories.\"[3] On 17 February 1952, he began writing his first James Bond novel, Casino Royale, at his Goldeneye estate in Oracabessa, Jamaica,[18] where he wrote all his Bond novels during the months of January and February each year.[19] He started the story shortly before his wedding to his pregnant girlfriend, Ann Charteris, in order to distract himself from his forthcoming nuptials.[20]\nAfter completing the manuscript for Casino Royale, Fleming showed it to his friend (and later editor) William Plomer to read. Plomer liked it and submitted it to the publishers, Jonathan Cape, who did not like it as much. Cape finally published it in 1953 on the recommendation of Fleming's older brother Peter, an established travel writer.[19] Between 1953 and 1966, two years after his death, twelve novels and two short-story collections were published, with the last two books—The Man with the Golden Gun and Octopussy and The Living Daylights—published posthumously.[21] All the books were published in the UK through Jonathan Cape.\nPost-Fleming novels\nAfter Fleming's death, a continuation novel, Colonel Sun, was written by Kingsley Amis (as Robert Markham) and published in 1968.[36] Amis had already written a literary study of Fleming's Bond novels in his 1965 work The James Bond Dossier.[37] Although novelisations of two of the Eon Productions Bond films appeared in print, James Bond, the Spy Who Loved Me and James Bond and Moonraker, both written by screenwriter Christopher Wood,[38] the series of novels did not continue until the 1980s. In 1981, the thriller writer John Gardner picked up the series with Licence Renewed.[39] Gardner went on to write sixteen Bond books in total; two of the books he wrote were novelisations of Eon Productions films of the same name: Licence to Kill and GoldenEye. Gardner moved the Bond series into the 1980s, although he retained the ages of the characters as they were when Fleming had left them.[40] In 1996, Gardner retired from writing James Bond books due to ill health.[41]\nIn 1996, the American author Raymond Benson became the author of the Bond novels. Benson had previously been the author of The James Bond Bedside Companion, first published in 1984.[56] By the time he moved on to other, non-Bond related projects in 2002, Benson had written six Bond novels, three novelisations and three short stories.[57]\nAfter a gap of six years, Sebastian Faulks was commissioned by Ian Fleming Publications to write a new Bond novel, which was released on 28 May 2008, the 100th anniversary of Fleming's birth.[67] The book—titled Devil May Care—was published in the UK by Penguin Books and by Doubleday in the US.[68] American writer Jeffery Deaver was then commissioned by Ian Fleming Publications to produce Carte Blanche, which was published on 26 May 2011.[69] The book turned Bond into a post-9/11 agent, independent of MI5 or MI6.[70] On 26 September 2013, Solo by William Boyd, set in 1969, was published.[71] In October 2014, it was announced that Anthony Horowitz was to write a Bond continuation novel.[72] Set in the 1950s two weeks after the events of Goldfinger, it contains material written, but previously unreleased, by Fleming. Trigger Mortis was released on 8 September 2015.[73][74][75] Horowitz's second Bond novel, Forever and a Day, tells the origin story of Bond as a 00 agent prior to the events of Casino Royale. The novel, also based on unpublished material from Fleming, was released on 31 May 2018.[76][77] Horowitz's third Bond novel, With a Mind to Kill, was published on 26 May 2022.[78] Charlie Higson's first adult Bond novel, On His Majesty's Secret Service, was published on 4 May 2023 to celebrate the Coronation of King Charles III and support the National Literacy Trust.[79]\nYoung Bond\nThe Young Bond series of novels was started by Charlie Higson[80] and, between 2005 and 2009, five novels and one short story were published.[81] The first Young Bond novel, SilverFin was also adapted and released as a graphic novel on 2 October 2008 by Puffin Books.[82] In October 2013 Ian Fleming Publications announced that Stephen Cole would continue the series, with the first edition scheduled to be released in Autumn 2014.[83]\nThe Moneypenny Diaries\nThe Moneypenny Diaries are a trilogy of novels chronicling the life of Miss Moneypenny, M's personal secretary. The novels are written by Samantha Weinberg under the pseudonym Kate Westbrook, who is depicted as the book's \"editor\".[91] The first instalment of the trilogy, subtitled Guardian Angel, was released on 10 October 2005 in the UK.[92] A second volume, subtitled Secret Servant was released on 2 November 2006 in the UK, published by John Murray.[93] A third volume, subtitled Final Fling was released on 1 May 2008.[94]\nAdaptations\nTelevision\nIn 1954, CBS paid Ian Fleming $1,000 ($11,709 in 2024 dollars[98]) to adapt his novel Casino Royale into a one-hour television adventure, \"Casino Royale\", as part of its Climax! series.[99] The episode aired live on 21 October 1954 and starred Barry Nelson as \"Card Sense\" James Bond and Peter Lorre as Le Chiffre.[100] The novel was adapted for American audiences to show Bond as an American agent working for \"Combined Intelligence\", while the character Felix Leiter—American in the novel—became British onscreen and was renamed Clarence Leiter.[101]\nIn 1964 Roger Moore appeared as James Bond in an extended comedy sketch opposite Millicent Martin as Sonia Sekova in her ATV TV series Mainly Millicent, which also makes reference to 007. It was written by Dick Hills and Sid Green. Undiscovered for several years, it reappeared as an extra in the DVD and Blu-ray release of Live and Let Die.[102]\nIn 1973, a BBC documentary Omnibus: The British Hero featured Christopher Cazenove playing a number of such title characters (e.g. Richard Hannay and Bulldog Drummond). The documentary included James Bond in dramatised scenes from Goldfinger—notably featuring 007 being threatened with the novel's circular saw, rather than the film's laser beam—and Diamonds Are Forever.[103]\nIn 1991, a spin-off animated series, James Bond Jr., was produced with Corey Burton in the role of Bond's nephew, James Bond Jr.[104]\nIn 2022, a reality competition show based on the franchise, 007: Road to a Million, was released on Amazon Prime Video.[105]\nRadio\nIn 1958, the novel Moonraker was adapted for broadcast on South African radio, with Bob Holness providing the voice of Bond.[106][107] According to The Independent, \"listeners across the Union thrilled to Bob's cultured tones as he defeated evil master criminals in search of world domination\".[108]\nThe BBC have adapted five of the Fleming novels for broadcast: in 1990 You Only Live Twice was adapted into a 90-minute radio play for BBC Radio 4 with Michael Jayston playing James Bond. The production was repeated a number of times between 2008 and 2011.[109] On 24 May 2008 BBC Radio 4 broadcast an adaptation of Dr. No. The actor Toby Stephens, who played Bond villain Gustav Graves in the Eon Productions version of Die Another Day, played Bond, while Dr. Julius No was played by David Suchet.[110] Following its success, a second story was adapted and on 3 April 2010 BBC Radio 4 broadcast Goldfinger with Stephens again playing Bond.[111] Sir Ian McKellen was Auric Goldfinger and Stephens' Die Another Day co-star Rosamund Pike played Pussy Galore. The play was adapted from Fleming's novel by Archie Scottney and was directed by Martin Jarvis.[112] In 2012, the novel From Russia, with Love was dramatised for Radio 4; it featured a full cast again starring Stephens as Bond.[113] In May 2014 Stephens again played Bond, in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, with Alfred Molina as Ernst Stavro Blofeld, and Joanna Lumley (who appeared in the 1969 film adaptation) as Irma Bunt.[114]\nComics\nIn 1957, the Daily Express approached Ian Fleming to adapt his stories into comic strips, offering him £1,500 per novel and a share of takings from syndication.[115] After initial reluctance, Fleming, who felt the strips would lack the quality of his writing, agreed.[116] To aid the Daily Express in illustrating Bond, Fleming commissioned an artist to create a sketch of how he believed James Bond looked. The illustrator, John McLusky, however, felt that Fleming's 007 looked too \"outdated\" and \"pre-war\" and changed Bond to give him a more masculine look.[117] The first strip, Casino Royale was published from 7 July 1958 to 13 December 1958[118] and was written by Anthony Hern and illustrated by John McLusky.[119]\nMost of the Bond novels and short stories have since been adapted for illustration, as well as Kingsley Amis's Colonel Sun; the works were written by Henry Gammidge or Jim Lawrence (except for the adaptation of Dr. No which was written by future Modesty Blaise creator Peter O'Donnell) with Yaroslav Horak replacing McClusky as artist in 1966.[118] After the Fleming and Amis material had been adapted, original stories were produced, continuing in the Daily Express and Sunday Express until May 1977.[117]\nSeveral comic book adaptations of the James Bond films have been published through the years: at the time of Dr. No's release in October 1962, a comic book adaptation of the screenplay, written by Norman J. Nodel, was published in Britain as part of the Classics Illustrated anthology series.[120] It was later reprinted in the United States by DC Comics as part of its Showcase anthology series, in January 1963. This was the first American comic book appearance of James Bond and is noteworthy for being a relatively rare example of a British comic being reprinted in a fairly high-profile American comic. It was also one of the earliest comics to be censored on racial grounds (some skin tones and dialogue were changed for the American market).[121][120]\nWith the release of the 1981 film For Your Eyes Only, Marvel Comics published a two-issue comic book adaptation of the film.[122][123] When Octopussy was released in the cinemas in 1983, Marvel published an accompanying comic;[120] Eclipse also produced a one-off comic for Licence to Kill, although Timothy Dalton refused to allow his likeness to be used.[124] New Bond stories were also drawn up and published from 1989 onwards through Marvel, Eclipse Comics, Dark Horse Comics and Dynamite Entertainment.[120][123][125]\nFilms\nEon Productions films\nEon Productions, the company of Canadian Harry Saltzman and American Albert R. \"Cubby\" Broccoli, released the first cinema adaptation of an Ian Fleming novel, Dr. No (1962), based on the eponymous 1958 novel and featuring Sean Connery as 007.[126] Connery starred in a further four films before leaving the role after You Only Live Twice (1967),[127] which was taken up by George Lazenby for On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969).[128] Lazenby left the role after just one appearance and Connery was brought back for his last Eon-produced film Diamonds Are Forever.[129]\nRoger Moore was appointed to the role of 007 for Live and Let Die (1973). He played Bond a further six times over twelve years, before being replaced by Timothy Dalton for two films. After a six-year hiatus, during which a legal wrangle threatened Eon's productions of the Bond films,[130] Irish actor Pierce Brosnan was cast as Bond in GoldenEye (1995); he remained in the role for a total of four films through 2002. In 2006, Daniel Craig was given the role for Casino Royale (2006), which rebooted the series.[131] Craig appeared for a total of five films.[132] The series has grossed well over $7 billion to date, making it the fifth-highest-grossing film series.[133]\nIn March 2022, Amazon purchased Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) for $8.5 billion, and the distribution rights to its library of films, including the James Bond movies. After creating the merged Amazon MGM Studios, the company became involved in developing the next theatrical iteration of the character.[134] By February 2025, the studio paid an additional $1 billion to acquire creative control of the future of the franchise from producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson; with the duo officially retiring from their historical oversight career for James Bond feature films. As part of the deal, the family will receive a monetary \"Bond dividend\" for the foreseeable future. Amazon MGM commence the search for a studio executive to oversee the property (à la Marvel Studios' Kevin Feige), while also determining the next respective director and star of the franchise.[135] In March 2025, Amazon closed deals with Amy Pascal and David Heyman to take charge of the franchise and replace Broccoli and Wilson as producers on its next instalment.[136]\n-\nSean Connery\n(1962–67; 1971) -\nGeorge Lazenby\n(1969) -\nRoger Moore\n(1973–85) -\nTimothy Dalton\n(1987–89) -\nPierce Brosnan\n(1995–2002) -\nDaniel Craig\n(2006–21)\nNon-Eon films\nIn 1967, Casino Royale was adapted into a parody Bond film starring David Niven as Sir James Bond and Ursula Andress as Vesper Lynd. Niven had been Fleming's preference for the role of Bond.[137] The result of a court case in the High Court in London in 1963 allowed Kevin McClory to produce a remake of Thunderball titled Never Say Never Again in 1983.[138] The film, produced by Jack Schwartzman's Taliafilm production company and starring Sean Connery as Bond, was not part of the Eon series of Bond films. In 1997, the Sony Corporation acquired all or some of McClory's rights in an undisclosed deal,[138] which were then subsequently acquired by MGM, whilst on 4 December 1997, MGM announced that the company had purchased the rights to Never Say Never Again from Taliafilm.[139] As of 2015[update], Eon holds the full adaptation rights to all of Fleming's Bond novels.[138][140]\nMusic\n\" cocky, swaggering, confident, dark, dangerous, suggestive, sexy, unstoppable.\"\nThe \"James Bond Theme\" was written by Monty Norman and was first orchestrated by the John Barry Orchestra for 1962's Dr. No, although the actual authorship of the music has been a matter of controversy for many years.[142] In 2001, Norman won £30,000 in libel damages from The Sunday Times newspaper, which suggested that Barry was entirely responsible for the composition.[143] The theme, as written by Norman and arranged by Barry, was described by another Bond film composer, David Arnold, as \"bebop-swing vibe coupled with that vicious, dark, distorted electric guitar, definitely an instrument of rock 'n' roll ... it represented everything about the character you would want: It was cocky, swaggering, confident, dark, dangerous, suggestive, sexy, unstoppable. And he did it in two minutes.\"[141] Barry composed the scores for eleven Bond films[144] and had an uncredited contribution to Dr. No with his arrangement of the \"James Bond Theme\".[141]\nA Bond film staple are the theme songs heard during their title sequences sung by well-known popular singers.[145] Shirley Bassey performed three Bond theme songs, with her 1964 song \"Goldfinger\" inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008.[146] Several of the songs produced for the films have been nominated for Academy Awards for Original Song, including Paul McCartney's \"Live and Let Die\",[147] Carly Simon's \"Nobody Does It Better\",[148] Sheena Easton's \"For Your Eyes Only\",[149] Adele's \"Skyfall\",[150] Sam Smith's \"Writing's on the Wall\",[151] and Billie Eilish's \"No Time to Die\".[152] Adele won the award at the 85th Academy Awards, Smith won at the 88th Academy Awards, and Eilish won at the 94th Academy Awards.[152][153] For the non-Eon produced Casino Royale, Burt Bacharach's score included \"The Look of Love\" (sung by Dusty Springfield), which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song.[154]\nVideo games\nIn 1983, the first Bond video game James Bond 007, developed and published by Parker Brothers, was released for the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Atari 8-bit computers, Commodore 64, and ColecoVision.[155] Since then, there have been numerous video games either based on the films or using original storylines. In 1997, the first-person shooter video game GoldenEye 007 was developed by Rare for the Nintendo 64, based on GoldenEye.[156] The game received highly positive reviews,[157] won the BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Award for UK Developer of the Year in 1998,[158] and sold over eight million copies worldwide,[159][160] grossing $250 million,[161] making it the third-best-selling Nintendo 64 game.[162] It is frequently cited as one of the greatest video games of all time.[163][164][165]\nIn 1999, Electronic Arts acquired the licence and released Tomorrow Never Dies on 16 December 1999.[166] In October 2000, they released The World Is Not Enough[167] for the Nintendo 64[168] followed by 007 Racing for the PlayStation on 21 November 2000.[169] In 2003, the company released James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing,[170] which included the likenesses and voices of Pierce Brosnan, Willem Dafoe, Heidi Klum, Judi Dench and John Cleese, amongst others.[171] In November 2005, Electronic Arts released a video game adaptation of 007: From Russia with Love,[172] which involved Sean Connery's image and voice-over for Bond.[172] In 2006, Electronic Arts announced a game based on then-upcoming film Casino Royale: the game was cancelled because it would not be ready by the film's release in November of that year. With MGM losing revenue from lost licensing fees, the franchise was moved from EA to Activision.[173] Activision subsequently released the 007: Quantum of Solace game on 31 October 2008, based on the film of the same name.[174]\nA new version of GoldenEye 007 featuring Daniel Craig was released for the Wii and a handheld version for the Nintendo DS in November 2010.[175] A year later a new version was released for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 under the title GoldenEye 007: Reloaded.[176][177] In October 2012 007 Legends was released, which featured one mission from each of the Bond actors of the Eon Productions' series.[178] In November 2020, IO Interactive announced Project 007, an original James Bond video game, working closely with licensors MGM and Eon Productions.[179][180]\nRole-playing game\nFrom 1983 to 1987, a licensed tabletop role-playing game, James Bond 007: Role-Playing In Her Majesty's Secret Service, was published by Victory Games (a branch of Avalon Hill) and designed by Gerard Christopher Klug. It was the most popular espionage role-playing game for its time.[181] In addition to providing materials for players to create original scenarios, the game also offered players the opportunity to have adventures modelled after many of the Eon Productions film adaptations, albeit with modifications to provide challenges by preventing players from slavishly imitating Bond's actions in the stories.[181]\nGuns, vehicles, skills and gadgets\nGuns\nFor the first five novels, Fleming armed Bond with a Beretta 418[182] until he received a letter from a thirty-one-year-old Bond enthusiast and gun expert, Geoffrey Boothroyd, criticising Fleming's choice of firearm for Bond,[183] calling it \"a lady's gun—and not a very nice lady at that!\"[184] Boothroyd suggested that Bond should swap his Beretta for a 7.65mm Walther PPK and this exchange of arms made it to Dr. No.[185] Boothroyd also gave Fleming advice on the Berns-Martin triple draw shoulder holster and a number of the weapons used by SMERSH and other villains.[186] In thanks, Fleming gave the MI6 Armourer in his novels the name Major Boothroyd and, in Dr. No, M, the Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service, introduces him to Bond as \"the greatest small-arms expert in the world\".[185] Bond also used a variety of rifles, including the Savage Model 99 in \"For Your Eyes Only\" and a Winchester .308 target rifle in \"The Living Daylights\".[182] Other handguns used by Bond in the Fleming books included the Colt Detective Special and a long-barrelled Colt .45 Army Special.[182]\nThe first Bond film, Dr. No, saw M (Bernard Lee) ordering Bond (Sean Connery) to leave his Beretta behind and take up the Walther PPK,[187] which Bond used in eighteen films.[188] In Tomorrow Never Dies and the two subsequent films, Bond's main weapon was the Walther P99 semi-automatic pistol.[188]\nVehicles\nIn the early Bond stories Fleming gave Bond a battleship-grey Bentley 4+1⁄2 Litre with an Amherst Villiers supercharger.[189] After Bond's car was written off by Hugo Drax in Moonraker, Fleming gave Bond a Mark II Continental Bentley, which he used in the remaining books of the series.[190] During Goldfinger, Bond was issued an Aston Martin DB Mark III with a homing device, which he used to track Goldfinger across France. Bond returned to his Bentley for the subsequent novels.[190]\nThe Bond of the films has driven a number of cars, including the Aston Martin V8 Vantage,[191] during the 1980s, the V12 Vanquish[191] and DBS[192] during the 2000s, as well as the Lotus Esprit;[193] the BMW Z3,[194] BMW 750iL[194] and the BMW Z8.[194] He has, however, also needed to drive a number of other vehicles, ranging from a Citroën 2CV to a Routemaster Bus, amongst others.[195]\nBond's most famous car is the silver grey Aston Martin DB5, first seen in Goldfinger;[196] it later featured in Thunderball, GoldenEye, Tomorrow Never Dies, Casino Royale, Skyfall and Spectre.[197][198] The films have used a number of different Aston Martins for filming and publicity, one of which was sold in January 2006 at an auction in the US for $2.1 million to an unnamed European collector.[199] In 2010, another DB5 used in Goldfinger was sold at auction for $4.6m million (£2.6 million).[200]\nSkills\nJames Bond possesses a diverse set of skills that contribute to his effectiveness as a secret agent:\n- Marksmanship: Bond demonstrates exceptional proficiency with firearms, particularly handguns and rifles, showcasing remarkable accuracy and quick reflexes.[201]\n- Hand-to-hand combat: He is skilled in various forms of unarmed combat, including judo and boxing, allowing him to defeat opponents in close quarters.[202]\n- Espionage techniques: As a top MI6 agent, Bond excels in espionage methods such as infiltration, surveillance, and intelligence gathering.[203]\nGadgets\nFleming's novels and early screen adaptations presented minimal equipment such as the booby-trapped attaché case in From Russia, with Love, although this situation changed dramatically with the films.[204] However, the effects of the two Eon-produced Bond films Dr. No and From Russia with Love had an effect on the novel The Man with the Golden Gun, through the increased number of devices used in Fleming's final story.[205]\nFor the film adaptations of Bond, the pre-mission briefing by Q Branch became one of the motifs that ran through the series.[206] Dr. No provided no spy-related gadgets, but a Geiger counter was used; industrial designer Andy Davey observed that the first ever onscreen spy-gadget was the attaché case shown in From Russia with Love, which he described as \"a classic 007 product\".[207] The gadgets assumed a higher profile in the 1964 film Goldfinger. The film's success encouraged further espionage equipment from Q Branch to be supplied to Bond, although the increased use of technology led to an accusation that Bond was over-reliant on equipment, particularly in the later films.[208]\n\"If it hadn't been for Q Branch, you'd have been dead long ago!\"\nDavey noted that \"Bond's gizmos follow the zeitgeist more closely than any other ... nuance in the films\"[207] as they moved from the potential representations of the future in the early films, through to the brand-name obsessions of the later films.[207] It is also noticeable that, although Bond uses a number of pieces of equipment from Q Branch, including the Little Nellie autogyro,[209] a jet pack[210] and the exploding attaché case,[211] the villains are also well-equipped with custom-made devices,[207] including Francisco Scaramanga (Chistopher Lee)'s golden gun,[212] Rosa Klebb (Lotte Lenya)'s poison-tipped shoes,[213] Oddjob (Harold Sakata)'s steel-rimmed bowler hat[214] and Blofeld (Telly Savalas)'s communication devices in his agents' vanity case.[207]\nCultural impact\nCinematically, Bond has been a major influence within the spy genre since the release of Dr. No in 1962,[215] with 22 secret agent films released in 1966 alone attempting to capitalise on the Bond franchise's popularity and success.[216] The first parody was the 1964 film Carry On Spying, which shows the villain Dr. Crow (Judith Furse) being overcome by agents who included James Bind (Charles Hawtry) and Daphne Honeybutt (Barbara Windsor).[217] One of the films that reacted against the portrayal of Bond was the Harry Palmer series, whose first film, The Ipcress File, starring Michael Caine, was released in 1965. The eponymous hero is a rough-edged, petty crook turned spy, and was what academic Jeremy Packer called an \"anti-Bond\",[218] or what Christoph Lindner calls \"the thinking man's Bond\".[219] The Palmer series were produced by Harry Saltzman, who also used key crew members from the Bond series, including designer Ken Adam, editor Peter R. Hunt and composer John Barry.[220] The four Matt Helm films starring Dean Martin (released between 1966 and 1969),[221] the Flint series starring James Coburn (comprising two films, one each in 1966 and 1967),[222] while The Man from U.N.C.L.E. also moved onto the cinema screen, with eight films released: all were testaments to Bond's prominence in popular culture.[144] More recently, the Austin Powers series by writer, producer and comedian Mike Myers,[223] and other parodies such as the Johnny English trilogy of films,[224] have also used elements from or parodied the Bond films.\nFollowing the release of the film Dr. No in 1962, the line \"Bond ... James Bond\", became a catch phrase that entered the lexicon of Western popular culture: writers John Cork and Bruce Scivally said of the introduction in Dr. No that the \"signature introduction would become the most famous and loved film line ever\".[225] In 2001, it was voted as the \"best-loved one-liner in cinema\" by British cinema goers,[226] and in 2005, it was honoured as the 22nd greatest quotation in cinema history by the American Film Institute as part of their 100 Years Series.[227] A 2024 survey by online investment advisor and digital wealth management company MoneyFarm found that 70 per cent of Brits said they associated the word \"bond\" with James Bond, rather than the savings product of the same name.[228]\nThe 2005 American Film Institute's 100 Years series recognised the character of James Bond himself as the third greatest film hero.[229] He was also placed at number 11 on a similar list by Empire[230] and as the fifth greatest movie character of all time by Premiere.[231] In 1965, Time magazine observed \"James Bond has developed into the biggest mass-cult hero of the decade\".[232]\nThe 25 James Bond films produced by Eon are the longest continually running film series of all time, and including the two non Eon produced films, the 27 Bond films have grossed over $7.04 billion in total, making it the sixth-highest-grossing franchise to date. It is estimated that since Dr. No, a quarter of the world's population have seen at least one Bond film.[233] The UK Film Distributors' Association have stated that the importance of the Bond series of films to the British film industry cannot be overstated, as they \"form the backbone of the industry\".[234]\nTelevision also saw the effect of Bond films, with the NBC series The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,[235] which was described as the \"first network television imitation\" of Bond,[236] largely because Fleming provided advice and ideas on the development of the series, even giving the main character played by Robert Vaughn the name Napoleon Solo.[237] Other 1960s television series inspired by Bond include I Spy,[222] and Get Smart.[238]\nConsidered a British cultural icon, James Bond had become such a symbol of the United Kingdom that the character, played by Craig, appeared in the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics as Queen Elizabeth II's escort.[239][240] From 1968 to 2003, and since 2016, the Cadbury chocolate box Milk Tray has been advertised by the 'Milk Tray Man', a tough James Bond–style figure who undertakes daunting 'raids' to surreptitiously deliver a box of Milk Tray chocolates to a lady.[241][242] Bond has been commemorated numerous times on a UK postage stamp issued by the Royal Mail, most recently in their March 2020 series to mark the 25th Bond film release.[243]\nThroughout the life of the film series, a number of tie-in products have been released.[244] \"Bondmania\", a term deriving from the adjacent \"Beatlemania\" and initiated in 1964 following the enormous success of Goldfinger, described the clamour for Bond films and their related products, from soundtrack LPs to children's toys, board games, alarm clocks playing the Bond theme, and 007-branded shirts.[245][246] In 2018, a James Bond museum opened atop the Austrian Alps.[247] The futuristic museum is constructed on the summit of Gaislachkogl Mountain in Sölden at 10,000 ft (3,048 m) above sea level.[248][249]\nThe real MI6 has an ambiguous relationship with Bond. The films may attract job applicants who may be unsuited for espionage, while dissuading more-qualified candidates.[250] While serving as Chief of SIS, Alex Younger said that were Bond to apply for an MI6 job \"he would have to change his ways\". Younger said, however, that the franchise had \"created a powerful brand for MI6 ... Many of our counterparts envy the sheer global recognition of our acronym\",[251] and that being depicted to global audiences as a \"ubiquitous intelligence presence\" was \"quite a force multiplier\". The Russian Federal Security Service so envied Bond that it created an annual award for fictional depictions of Russian spies.[250]\nPublic reception\nThe James Bond franchise enjoys widespread popularity across the world. In 2014, it was estimated that approximately 20% of the world's population has watched at least one Bond film.[252]\nIn 2012, the polling organisation YouGov conducted a survey of American Bond fans, categorising responses by age, sex and political affiliation. All groups selected Sean Connery as their favourite Bond actor.[253] A 2018 poll found that 47% of American adults had seen at least one Bond film, with 27% having seen every film.[254]\nQueen Elizabeth II met the first six actors to play James Bond on the screen. She met Connery at the world premiere of You Only Live Twice in 1967, and, according to the royal biographer Gyles Brandreth: \"She really did love all the early James Bond films\", preferring the earlier films, \"before they got so loud\".[255] Several prominent politicians have also been fans of the franchise, including John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan and Kim Jong Il.[256][257]\nCriticisms\nThe James Bond character and related media have received a number of criticisms and reactions across the political spectrum, and are still highly debated in popular culture studies.[258][259] Some observers accuse the Bond novels and films of misogyny and sexism.[260][261] In September 2021, No Time to Die director Cary Fukunaga described Sean Connery's version of Bond as 'basically a rapist'.[262] The franchise has on occasion also been a target of religious criticism. In 1962, Vatican City's official newspaper L'Osservatore Romano condemned the film Dr. No, referring to it as \"a dangerous mixture of violence, vulgarity, sadism and sex\".[263] However, in 2012, the newspaper went on to give positive reviews to the film Skyfall.[264]\nGeographers have considered the role of exotic locations in the movies in the dynamics of the Cold War, with power struggles among blocs playing out in the peripheral areas.[265] Other critics claim that the Bond films reflect imperial nostalgia.[266][267]\nCensorship and alterations\nBans and censorship by country\nSeveral James Bond novels, films, and video games have been banned, censored, or altered in several countries.\n2023 changes\nIn February 2023, Ian Fleming Publications (which administers all Fleming's literary works), edited the Bond series as part of a sensitivity review. The April 2023 re-releases of the series are planned to tie into the 70th anniversary of Casino Royale. The new editions remove a number of references to race, including some slurs, along with some disparagements of women and homosexuality.[278] They include a disclaimer added at the beginning of each book, reading:\nThis book was written at a time when terms and attitudes which might be considered offensive by modern readers were commonplace. A number of updates have been made in this edition, while keeping as close as possible to the original text and the period in which it is set.[279]\nThe decision was met with strong criticism by media outlets and public commentators, who condemned the changes as literary censorship.[285] The View host Whoopi Goldberg expressed her opposition, arguing that offensive historical literature should be left unaltered;[286] while National Review contributors Charles C. W. Cooke and Douglas Murray attacked the changes as excessive political correctness.[287][288] Fleming biographer Andrew Lycett also opposed the changes, writing that \"what an author commits to paper is sacrosanct and shouldn't be altered...The only changes to the text should come from the author.\"[289]\nSee also\n- 9007 James Bond, asteroid named after the character\nReferences\n- ^ Reilly, Liam (20 February 2025). \"Amazon MGM Studios takes creative control of James Bond franchise\".

          "content": "Geology\nGeology (from Ancient Greek γῆ (gê) 'earth' and λoγία (-logía) 'study of, discourse')[1][2] is a branch of natural science concerned with the Earth and other astronomical objects, the rocks of which they are composed, and the processes by which they change over time.[3] Modern geology significantly overlaps all other Earth sciences, including hydrology. It is integrated with Earth system science and planetary science.\nGeology describes the structure of the Earth on and beneath its surface and the processes that have shaped that structure. Geologists study the mineralogical composition of rocks in order to get insight into their history of formation. Geology determines the relative ages of rocks found at a given location; geochemistry (a branch of geology) determines their absolute ages.[4] By combining various petrological, crystallographic, and paleontological tools, geologists are able to chronicle the geological history of the Earth as a whole. One aspect is to demonstrate the age of the Earth. Geology provides evidence for plate tectonics, the evolutionary history of life, and the Earth's past climates.\nGeologists broadly study the properties and processes of Earth and other terrestrial planets. Geologists use a wide variety of methods to understand the Earth's structure and evolution, including fieldwork, rock description, geophysical techniques, chemical analysis, physical experiments, and numerical modelling. In practical terms, geology is important for mineral and hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation, evaluating water resources, understanding natural hazards, remediating environmental problems, and providing insights into past climate change. Geology is a major academic discipline, and it is central to geological engineering and plays an important role in geotechnical engineering.\nGeological material\n[edit]The majority of geological data comes from research on solid Earth materials. Meteorites and other extraterrestrial natural materials are also studied by geological methods.\nMinerals\n[edit]Minerals are naturally occurring elements and compounds with a definite homogeneous chemical composition and an ordered atomic arrangement.\nEach mineral has distinct physical properties, and there are many tests to determine each of them. Minerals are often identified through these tests. The specimens can be tested for:[5]\n- Color: Minerals are grouped by their color. Mostly diagnostic but impurities can change a mineral's color.\n- Streak: Performed by scratching the sample on a porcelain plate. The color of the streak can help identify the mineral.\n- Hardness: The resistance of a mineral to scratching or indentation.\n- Breakage pattern: A mineral can either show fracture or cleavage, the former being breakage of uneven surfaces, and the latter a breakage along closely spaced parallel planes.\n- Luster: Quality of light reflected from the surface of a mineral. Examples are metallic, pearly, waxy, dull.\n- Specific gravity: the weight of a specific volume of a mineral.\n- Effervescence: Involves dripping hydrochloric acid on the mineral to test for fizzing.\n- Magnetism: Involves using a magnet to test for magnetism.\n- Taste: Minerals can have a distinctive taste such as halite (which tastes like table salt).\nRock\n[edit]A rock is any naturally occurring solid mass or aggregate of minerals or mineraloids. Most research in geology is associated with the study of rocks, as they provide the primary record of the majority of the geological history of the Earth. There are three major types of rock: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. The rock cycle illustrates the relationships among them (see diagram).\nWhen a rock solidifies or crystallizes from melt (magma or lava), it is an igneous rock. This rock can be weathered and eroded, then redeposited and lithified into a sedimentary rock. Sedimentary rocks are mainly divided into four categories: sandstone, shale, carbonate, and evaporite. This group of classifications focuses partly on the size of sedimentary particles (sandstone and shale), and partly on mineralogy and formation processes (carbonation and evaporation).[6] Igneous and sedimentary rocks can then be turned into metamorphic rocks by heat and pressure that change its mineral content, resulting in a characteristic fabric. All three types may melt again, and when this happens, new magma is formed, from which an igneous rock may once again solidify. Organic matter, such as coal, bitumen, oil, and natural gas, is linked mainly to organic-rich sedimentary rocks.\nTo study all three types of rock, geologists evaluate the minerals of which they are composed and their other physical properties, such as texture and fabric.\nUnlithified material\n[edit]Geologists also study unlithified materials (referred to as superficial deposits) that lie above the bedrock.[7] This study is often known as Quaternary geology, after the Quaternary period of geologic history, which is the most recent period of geologic time.\nMagma\n[edit]Magma is the original unlithified source of all igneous rocks. The active flow of molten rock is closely studied in volcanology, and igneous petrology aims to determine the history of igneous rocks from their original molten source to their final crystallization.\nWhole-Earth structure\n[edit]Plate tectonics\n[edit]In the 1960s, it was discovered that the Earth's lithosphere, which includes the crust and rigid uppermost portion of the upper mantle, is separated into tectonic plates that move across the plastically deforming, solid, upper mantle, which is called the asthenosphere. This theory is supported by several types of observations, including seafloor spreading[9][10] and the global distribution of mountain terrain and seismicity.\nThere is an intimate coupling between the movement of the plates on the surface and the convection of the mantle (that is, the heat transfer caused by the slow movement of ductile mantle rock). Thus, oceanic parts of plates and the adjoining mantle convection currents always move in the same direction – because the oceanic lithosphere is actually the rigid upper thermal boundary layer of the convecting mantle. This coupling between rigid plates moving on the surface of the Earth and the convecting mantle is called plate tectonics.\nThe development of plate tectonics has provided a physical basis for many observations of the solid Earth. Long linear regions of geological features are explained as plate boundaries:[11]\n- Mid-ocean ridges, high regions on the seafloor where hydrothermal vents and volcanoes exist, are seen as divergent boundaries, where two plates move apart.\n- Arcs of volcanoes and earthquakes are theorized as convergent boundaries, where one plate subducts, or moves, under another.\n- Transform boundaries, such as the San Andreas Fault system, are where plates slide horizontally past each other.\nPlate tectonics has provided a mechanism for Alfred Wegener's theory of continental drift,[12] in which the continents move across the surface of the Earth over geological time. They also provided a driving force for crustal deformation, and a new setting for the observations of structural geology. The power of the theory of plate tectonics lies in its ability to combine all of these observations into a single theory of how the lithosphere moves over the convecting mantle.\nEarth structure\n[edit]Advances in seismology, computer modeling, and mineralogy and crystallography at high temperatures and pressures give insights into the internal composition and structure of the Earth.\nSeismologists can use the arrival times of seismic waves to image the interior of the Earth. Early advances in this field showed the existence of a liquid outer core (where shear waves were not able to propagate) and a dense solid inner core. These advances led to the development of a layered model of the Earth, with a lithosphere (including crust) on top, the mantle below (separated within itself by seismic discontinuities at 410 and 660 kilometers), and the outer core and inner core below that. More recently, seismologists have been able to create detailed images of wave speeds inside the earth in the same way a doctor images a body in a CT scan. These images have led to a much more detailed view of the interior of the Earth, and have replaced the simplified layered model with a much more dynamic model.\nMineralogists have been able to use the pressure and temperature data from the seismic and modeling studies alongside knowledge of the elemental composition of the Earth to reproduce these conditions in experimental settings and measure changes within the crystal structure. These studies explain the chemical changes associated with the major seismic discontinuities in the mantle and show the crystallographic structures expected in the inner core of the Earth.\nGeological time\n[edit]The geological time scale encompasses the history of the Earth.[13] It is bracketed at the earliest by the dates of the first Solar System material at 4.567 Ga[14] (or 4.567 billion years ago) and the formation of the Earth at 4.54 Ga[15][16] (4.54 billion years), which is the beginning of the Hadean eon – a division of geological time. At the later end of the scale, it is marked by the present day (in the Holocene epoch).\nTimescale of the Earth\n[edit]The following five timelines show the geologic time scale to scale. The first shows the entire time from the formation of Earth to the present, but this gives little space for the most recent eon. The second timeline shows an expanded view of the most recent eon. In a similar way, the most recent era is expanded in the third timeline, the most recent period is expanded in the fourth timeline, and the most recent epoch is expanded in the fifth timeline.\n(Horizontal scale is millions of years for the above timelines; thousands of years for the timeline below)\nImportant milestones on Earth\n[edit]- 4.567 Ga (gigaannum: billion years ago): Solar system formation[14]\n- 4.54 Ga: Accretion, or formation, of Earth[15][16]\n- c. 4 Ga: End of Late Heavy Bombardment, the first life\n- c. 3.5 Ga: Start of photosynthesis\n- c. 2.3 Ga: Oxygenated atmosphere, first snowball Earth\n- 730–635 Ma (megaannum: million years ago): second snowball Earth\n- 541 ± 0.3 Ma: Cambrian explosion – vast multiplication of hard-bodied life; first abundant fossils; start of the Paleozoic\n- c. 380 Ma: First vertebrate land animals\n- 250 Ma: Permian-Triassic extinction – 90% of all land animals die; end of Paleozoic and beginning of Mesozoic\n- 66 Ma: Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction – Dinosaurs die; end of Mesozoic and beginning of Cenozoic\n- c. 7 Ma: First hominins appear\n- 3.9 Ma: First Australopithecus, direct ancestor to modern Homo sapiens, appear\n- 200 ka (kiloannum: thousand years ago): First modern Homo sapiens appear in East Africa\nTimescale of the Moon\n[edit]\nTimescale of Mars\n[edit]Epochs:\nDating methods\n[edit]Relative dating\n[edit]Methods for relative dating were developed when geology first emerged as a natural science. Geologists still use the following principles today as a means to provide information about geological history and the timing of geological events.\nThe principle of uniformitarianism states that the geological processes observed in operation that modify the Earth's crust at present have worked in much the same way over geological time.[17] A fundamental principle of geology advanced by the 18th-century Scottish physician and geologist James Hutton is that \"the present is the key to the past.\" In Hutton's words: \"the past history of our globe must be explained by what can be seen to be happening now.\"[18]\nThe principle of intrusive relationships concerns crosscutting intrusions. In geology, when an igneous intrusion cuts across a formation of sedimentary rock, it can be determined that the igneous intrusion is younger than the sedimentary rock. Different types of intrusions include stocks, laccoliths, batholiths, sills and dikes.\nThe principle of cross-cutting relationships pertains to the formation of faults and the age of the sequences through which they cut. Faults are younger than the rocks they cut; accordingly, if a fault is found that penetrates some formations but not those on top of it, then the formations that were cut are older than the fault, and the ones that are not cut must be younger than the fault. Finding the key bed in these situations may help determine whether the fault is a normal fault or a thrust fault.[19]\nThe principle of inclusions and components states that, with sedimentary rocks, if inclusions (or clasts) are found in a formation, then the inclusions must be older than the formation that contains them. For example, in sedimentary rocks, it is common for gravel from an older formation to be ripped up and included in a newer layer. A similar situation with igneous rocks occurs when xenoliths are found. These foreign bodies are picked up as magma or lava flows, and are incorporated, later to cool in the matrix. As a result, xenoliths are older than the rock that contains them.\nThe principle of original horizontality states that the deposition of sediments occurs as essentially horizontal beds. Observation of modern marine and non-marine sediments in a wide variety of environments supports this generalization (although cross-bedding is inclined, the overall orientation of cross-bedded units is horizontal).[19]\nThe principle of superposition states that a sedimentary rock layer in a tectonically undisturbed sequence is younger than the one beneath it and older than the one above it. Logically a younger layer cannot slip beneath a layer previously deposited. This principle allows sedimentary layers to be viewed as a form of the vertical timeline, a partial or complete record of the time elapsed from deposition of the lowest layer to deposition of the highest bed.[19]\nThe principle of faunal succession is based on the appearance of fossils in sedimentary rocks. As organisms exist during the same period throughout the world, their presence or (sometimes) absence provides a relative age of the formations where they appear. Based on principles that William Smith laid out almost a hundred years before the publication of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, the principles of succession developed independently of evolutionary thought. The principle becomes quite complex, however, given the uncertainties of fossilization, localization of fossil types due to lateral changes in habitat (facies change in sedimentary strata), and that not all fossils formed globally at the same time.[20]\nAbsolute dating\n[edit]Geologists also use methods to determine the absolute age of rock samples and geological events. These dates are useful on their own and may also be used in conjunction with relative dating methods or to calibrate relative methods.[21]\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, advancement in geological science was facilitated by the ability to obtain accurate absolute dates to geological events using radioactive isotopes and other methods. This changed the understanding of geological time. Previously, geologists could only use fossils and stratigraphic correlation to date sections of rock relative to one another. With isotopic dates, it became possible to assign absolute ages to rock units, and these absolute dates could be applied to fossil sequences in which there was datable material, converting the old relative ages into new absolute ages.\nFor many geological applications, isotope ratios of radioactive elements are measured in minerals that give the amount of time that has passed since a rock passed through its particular closure temperature, the point at which different radiometric isotopes stop diffusing into and out of the crystal lattice.[22][23] These are used in geochronologic and thermochronologic studies. Common methods include uranium–lead dating, potassium–argon dating, argon–argon dating and uranium–thorium dating. These methods are used for a variety of applications. Dating of lava and volcanic ash layers found within a stratigraphic sequence can provide absolute age data for sedimentary rock units that do not contain radioactive isotopes and calibrate relative dating techniques. These methods can also be used to determine ages of pluton emplacement. Thermochemical techniques can be used to determine temperature profiles within the crust, the uplift of mountain ranges, and paleo-topography.\nFractionation of the lanthanide series elements is used to compute ages since rocks were removed from the mantle.\nOther methods are used for more recent events. Optically stimulated luminescence and cosmogenic radionuclide dating are used to date surfaces and/or erosion rates. Dendrochronology can also be used for the dating of landscapes. Radiocarbon dating is used for geologically young materials containing organic carbon.\nGeological development of an area\n[edit]The geology of an area changes through time as rock units are deposited and inserted, and deformational processes alter their shapes and locations.\nRock units are first emplaced either by deposition onto the surface or intrusion into the overlying rock. Deposition can occur when sediments settle onto the surface of the Earth and later lithify into sedimentary rock, or when as volcanic material such as volcanic ash or lava flows blanket the surface. Igneous intrusions such as batholiths, laccoliths, dikes, and sills, push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude.\nAfter the initial sequence of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be deformed and/or metamorphosed. Deformation typically occurs as a result of horizontal shortening, horizontal extension, or side-to-side (strike-slip) motion. These structural regimes broadly relate to convergent boundaries, divergent boundaries, and transform boundaries, respectively, between tectonic plates.\nWhen rock units are placed under horizontal compression, they shorten and become thicker. Because rock units, other than muds, do not significantly change in volume, this is accomplished in two primary ways: through faulting and folding. In the shallow crust, where brittle deformation can occur, thrust faults form, which causes the deeper rock to move on top of the shallower rock. Because deeper rock is often older, as noted by the principle of superposition, this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones. Movement along faults can result in folding, either because the faults are not planar or because rock layers are dragged along, forming drag folds as slip occurs along the fault. Deeper in the Earth, rocks behave plastically and fold instead of faulting. These folds can either be those where the material in the center of the fold buckles upwards, creating \"antiforms\", or where it buckles downwards, creating \"synforms\". If the tops of the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards, they are called anticlines and synclines, respectively. If some of the units in the fold are facing downward, the structure is called an overturned anticline or syncline, and if all of the rock units are overturned or the correct up-direction is unknown, they are simply called by the most general terms, antiforms, and synforms.\nEven higher pressures and temperatures during horizontal shortening can cause both folding and metamorphism of the rocks. This metamorphism causes changes in the mineral composition of the rocks; creates a foliation, or planar surface, that is related to mineral growth under stress. This can remove signs of the original textures of the rocks, such as bedding in sedimentary rocks, flow features of lavas, and crystal patterns in crystalline rocks.\nExtension causes the rock units as a whole to become longer and thinner. This is primarily accomplished through normal faulting and through the ductile stretching and thinning. Normal faults drop rock units that are higher below those that are lower. This typically results in younger units ending up below older units. Stretching of units can result in their thinning. In fact, at one location within the Maria Fold and Thrust Belt, the entire sedimentary sequence of the Grand Canyon appears over a length of less than a meter. Rocks at the depth to be ductilely stretched are often also metamorphosed. These stretched rocks can also pinch into lenses, known as boudins, after the French word for \"sausage\" because of their visual similarity.\nWhere rock units slide past one another, strike-slip faults develop in shallow regions, and become shear zones at deeper depths where the rocks deform ductilely.\nThe addition of new rock units, both depositionally and intrusively, often occurs during deformation. Faulting and other deformational processes result in the creation of topographic gradients, causing material on the rock unit that is increasing in elevation to be eroded by hillslopes and channels. These sediments are deposited on the rock unit that is going down. Continual motion along the fault maintains the topographic gradient in spite of the movement of sediment and continues to create accommodation space for the material to deposit. Deformational events are often also associated with volcanism and igneous activity. Volcanic ashes and lavas accumulate on the surface, and igneous intrusions enter from below. Dikes, long, planar igneous intrusions, enter along cracks, and therefore often form in large numbers in areas that are being actively deformed. This can result in the emplacement of dike swarms, such as those that are observable across the Canadian shield, or rings of dikes around the lava tube of a volcano.\nAll of these processes do not necessarily occur in a single environment and do not necessarily occur in a single order. The Hawaiian Islands, for example, consist almost entirely of layered basaltic lava flows. The sedimentary sequences of the mid-continental United States and the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States contain almost-undeformed stacks of sedimentary rocks that have remained in place since Cambrian time. Other areas are much more geologically complex. In the southwestern United States, sedimentary, volcanic, and intrusive rocks have been metamorphosed, faulted, foliated, and folded. Even older rocks, such as the Acasta gneiss of the Slave craton in northwestern Canada, the oldest known rock in the world have been metamorphosed to the point where their origin is indiscernible without laboratory analysis. In addition, these processes can occur in stages. In many places, the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States being a very visible example, the lower rock units were metamorphosed and deformed, and then deformation ended and the upper, undeformed units were deposited. Although any amount of rock emplacement and rock deformation can occur, and they can occur any number of times, these concepts provide a guide to understanding the geological history of an area.\nInvestigative methods\n[edit]Geologists use a number of fields, laboratory, and numerical modeling methods to decipher Earth history and to understand the processes that occur on and inside the Earth. In typical geological investigations, geologists use primary information related to petrology (the study of rocks), stratigraphy (the study of sedimentary layers), and structural geology (the study of positions of rock units and their deformation). In many cases, geologists also study modern soils, rivers, landscapes, and glaciers; investigate past and current life and biogeochemical pathways, and use geophysical methods to investigate the subsurface. Sub-specialities of geology may distinguish endogenous and exogenous geology.[24]\nField methods\n[edit]Geological field work varies depending on the task at hand. Typical fieldwork could consist of:\n- Geological mapping[25]\n- Structural mapping: identifying the locations of major rock units and the faults and folds that led to their placement there.\n- Stratigraphic mapping: pinpointing the locations of sedimentary facies (lithofacies and biofacies) or the mapping of isopachs of equal thickness of sedimentary rock\n- Surficial mapping: recording the locations of soils and surficial deposits\n- Surveying of topographic features\n- compilation of topographic maps[26]\n- Work to understand change across landscapes, including:\n- Patterns of erosion and deposition\n- River-channel change through migration and avulsion\n- Hillslope processes\n- Subsurface mapping through geophysical methods[27]\n- These methods include:\n- They aid in:\n- High-resolution stratigraphy\n- Measuring and describing stratigraphic sections on the surface\n- Well drilling and logging\n- Biogeochemistry and geomicrobiology[28]\n- Collecting samples to:\n- determine biochemical pathways\n- identify new species of organisms\n- identify new chemical compounds\n- and to use these discoveries to:\n- understand early life on Earth and how it functioned and metabolized\n- find important compounds for use in pharmaceuticals\n- Collecting samples to:\n- Paleontology: excavation of fossil material\n- Collection of samples for geochronology and thermochronology[29]\n- Glaciology: measurement of characteristics of glaciers and their motion[30]\nPetrology\n[edit]In addition to identifying rocks in the field (lithology), petrologists identify rock samples in the laboratory. Two of the primary methods for identifying rocks in the laboratory are through optical microscopy and by using an electron microprobe. In an optical mineralogy analysis, petrologists analyze thin sections of rock samples using a petrographic microscope, where the minerals can be identified through their different properties in plane-polarized and cross-polarized light, including their birefringence, pleochroism, twinning, and interference properties with a conoscopic lens.[31] In the electron microprobe, individual locations are analyzed for their exact chemical compositions and variation in composition within individual crystals.[32] Stable[33] and radioactive isotope[34] studies provide insight into the geochemical evolution of rock units.\nPetrologists can also use fluid inclusion data[35] and perform high temperature and pressure physical experiments[36] to understand the temperatures and pressures at which different mineral phases appear, and how they change through igneous[37] and metamorphic processes. This research can be extrapolated to the field to understand metamorphic processes and the conditions of crystallization of igneous rocks.[38] This work can also help to explain processes that occur within the Earth, such as subduction and magma chamber evolution.[39]\nStructural geology\n[edit]Structural geologists use microscopic analysis of oriented thin sections of geological samples to observe the fabric within the rocks, which gives information about strain within the crystalline structure of the rocks. They also plot and combine measurements of geological structures to better understand the orientations of faults and folds to reconstruct the history of rock deformation in the area. In addition, they perform analog and numerical experiments of rock deformation in large and small settings.\nThe analysis of structures is often accomplished by plotting the orientations of various features onto stereonets. A stereonet is a stereographic projection of a sphere onto a plane, in which planes are projected as lines and lines are projected as points. These can be used to find the locations of fold axes, relationships between faults, and relationships between other geological structures.\nAmong the most well-known experiments in structural geology are those involving orogenic wedges, which are zones in which mountains are built along convergent tectonic plate boundaries.[40] In the analog versions of these experiments, horizontal layers of sand are pulled along a lower surface into a back stop, which results in realistic-looking patterns of faulting and the growth of a critically tapered (all angles remain the same) orogenic wedge.[41] Numerical models work in the same way as these analog models, though they are often more sophisticated and can include patterns of erosion and uplift in the mountain belt.[42] This helps to show the relationship between erosion and the shape of a mountain range. These studies can also give useful information about pathways for metamorphism through pressure, temperature, space, and time.[43]\nStratigraphy\n[edit]In the laboratory, stratigraphers analyze samples of stratigraphic sections that can be returned from the field, such as those from drill cores.[44] Stratigraphers also analyze data from geophysical surveys that show the locations of stratigraphic units in the subsurface.[45] Geophysical data and well logs can be combined to produce a better view of the subsurface, and stratigraphers often use computer programs to do this in three dimensions.[46] Stratigraphers can then use these data to reconstruct ancient processes occurring on the surface of the Earth,[47] interpret past environments, and locate areas for water, coal, and hydrocarbon extraction.\nIn the laboratory, biostratigraphers analyze rock samples from outcrop and drill cores for the fossils found in them.[44] These fossils help scientists to date the core and to understand the depositional environment in which the rock units formed. Geochronologists precisely date rocks within the stratigraphic section to provide better absolute bounds on the timing and rates of deposition.[48] Magnetic stratigraphers look for signs of magnetic reversals in igneous rock units within the drill cores.[44] Other scientists perform stable-isotope studies on the rocks to gain information about past climate.[44]\nPlanetary geology\n[edit]With the advent of space exploration in the twentieth century, geologists have begun to look at other planetary bodies in the same ways that have been developed to study the Earth. This new field of study is called planetary geology (sometimes known as astrogeology) and relies on known geological principles to study other bodies of the Solar System. This is a major aspect of planetary science, and largely focuses on the terrestrial planets, icy moons, asteroids, comets, and meteorites. However, some planetary geophysicists study the giant planets and exoplanets.[49]\nAlthough the Greek-language-origin prefix geo refers to Earth, \"geology\" is often used in conjunction with the names of other planetary bodies when describing their composition and internal processes: examples are \"the geology of Mars\" and \"Lunar geology\". Specialized terms such as selenology (studies of the Moon), areology (of Mars), etc., are also in use.\nAlthough planetary geologists are interested in studying all aspects of other planets, a significant focus is to search for evidence of past or present life on other worlds. This has led to many missions whose primary or ancillary purpose is to examine planetary bodies for evidence of life. One of these is the Phoenix lander, which analyzed Martian polar soil for water, chemical, and mineralogical constituents related to biological processes.\nApplied geology\n[edit]Economic geology\n[edit]Economic geology is a branch of geology that deals with aspects of economic minerals that humankind uses to fulfill various needs. Economic minerals are those extracted profitably for various practical uses. Economic geologists help locate and manage the Earth's natural resources, such as petroleum and coal, as well as mineral resources, which include metals such as iron, copper, and uranium.\nMining geology\n[edit]Mining geology consists of the extractions of mineral and ore resources from the Earth. Some resources of economic interests include gemstones, metals such as gold and copper, and many minerals such as asbestos, Magnesite, perlite, mica, phosphates, zeolites, clay, pumice, quartz, and silica, as well as elements such as sulfur, chlorine, and helium.\nPetroleum geology\n[edit]Petroleum geologists study the locations of the subsurface of the Earth that can contain extractable hydrocarbons, especially petroleum and natural gas. Because many of these reservoirs are found in sedimentary basins,[50] they study the formation of these basins, as well as their sedimentary and tectonic evolution and the present-day positions of the rock units.\nEngineering geology\n[edit]Engineering geology is the application of geological principles to engineering practice for the purpose of assuring that the geological factors affecting the location, design, construction, operation, and maintenance of engineering works are properly addressed. Engineering geology is distinct from geological engineering, particularly in North America.\nIn the field of civil engineering, geological principles and analyses are used in order to ascertain the mechanical principles of the material on which structures are built. This allows tunnels to be built without collapsing, bridges and skyscrapers to be built with sturdy foundations, and buildings to be built that will not settle in clay and mud.[51]\nHydrology\n[edit]Geology and geological principles can be applied to various environmental problems such as stream restoration, the restoration of brownfields, and the understanding of the interaction between natural habitat and the geological environment. Groundwater hydrology, or hydrogeology, is used to locate groundwater,[52] which can often provide a ready supply of uncontaminated water and is especially important in arid regions,[53] and to monitor the spread of contaminants in groundwater wells.[52][54]\nPaleoclimatology\n[edit]Geologists also obtain data through stratigraphy, boreholes, core samples, and ice cores. Ice cores[55] and sediment cores[56] are used for paleoclimate reconstructions, which tell geologists about past and present temperature, precipitation, and sea level across the globe. These datasets are our primary source of information on global climate change outside of instrumental data.[57]\nNatural hazards\n[edit]Geologists and geophysicists study natural hazards in order to enact safe building codes and warning systems that are used to prevent loss of property and life.[58] Examples of important natural hazards that are pertinent to geology (as opposed those that are mainly or only pertinent to meteorology) are:\nHistory\n[edit]The study of the physical material of the Earth dates back at least to ancient Greece when Theophrastus (372–287 BCE) wrote the work Peri Lithon (On Stones). During the Roman period, Pliny the Elder wrote in detail of the many minerals and metals, then in practical use – even correctly noting the origin of amber. Additionally, in the 4th century BCE Aristotle made critical observations of the slow rate of geological change. He observed the composition of the land and formulated a theory where the Earth changes at a slow rate and that these changes cannot be observed during one person's lifetime. Aristotle developed one of the first evidence-based concepts connected to the geological realm regarding the rate at which the Earth physically changes.[60][61]\nAbu al-Rayhan al-Biruni (973–1048 CE) was one of the earliest Persian geologists, whose works included the earliest writings on the geology of India, hypothesizing that the Indian subcontinent was once a sea.[62] Drawing from Greek and Indian scientific literature that were not destroyed by the Muslim conquests, the Persian scholar Ibn Sina (Avicenna, 981–1037) proposed detailed explanations for the formation of mountains, the origin of earthquakes, and other topics central to modern geology, which provided an essential foundation for the later development of the science.[63][64] In China, the polymath Shen Kuo (1031–1095) formulated a hypothesis for the process of land formation: based on his observation of fossil animal shells in a geological stratum in a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean, he inferred that the land was formed by the erosion of the mountains and by deposition of silt.[65]\nGeorgius Agricola (1494–1555) published his groundbreaking work De Natura Fossilium in 1546 and is seen as the founder of geology as a scientific discipline.[66]\nNicolas Steno (1638–1686) is credited with the law of superposition, the principle of original horizontality, and the principle of lateral continuity: three defining principles of stratigraphy.\nThe word geology was first used by Ulisse Aldrovandi in 1603,[67][68] then by Jean-André Deluc in 1778[69] and introduced as a fixed term by Horace-Bénédict de Saussure in 1779.[70][71] The word is derived from the Greek γῆ, gê, meaning \"earth\" and λόγος, logos, meaning \"speech\".[72] But according to another source, the word \"geology\" comes from a Norwegian, Mikkel Pedersøn Escholt (1600–1669), who was a priest and scholar. Escholt first used the definition in his book titled, Geologia Norvegica (1657).[73][74]\nWilliam Smith (1769–1839) drew some of the first geological maps and began the process of ordering rock strata (layers) by examining the fossils contained in them.[59]\nIn 1763, Mikhail Lomonosov published his treatise On the Strata of Earth.[75] His work was the first narrative of modern geology, based on the unity of processes in time and explanation of the Earth's past from the present.[76]\nJames Hutton (1726–1797) is often viewed as the first modern geologist.[77] In 1785 he presented a paper entitled Theory of the Earth to the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In his paper, he explained his theory that the Earth must be much older than had previously been supposed to allow enough time for mountains to be eroded and for sediments to form new rocks at the bottom of the sea, which in turn were raised up to become dry land. Hutton published a two-volume version of his ideas in 1795.[78]\nFollowers of Hutton were known as Plutonists because they believed that some rocks were formed by vulcanism, which is the deposition of lava from volcanoes, as opposed to the Neptunists, led by Abraham Werner, who believed that all rocks had settled out of a large ocean whose level gradually dropped over time.\nThe first geological map of the U.S. was produced in 1809 by William Maclure.[79] In 1807, Maclure commenced the self-imposed task of making a geological survey of the United States. Almost every state in the Union was traversed and mapped by him, the Allegheny Mountains being crossed and recrossed some 50 times.[80] The results of his unaided labours were submitted to the American Philosophical Society in a memoir entitled Observations on the Geology of the United States explanatory of a Geological Map, and published in the Society's Transactions, together with the nation's first geological map.[81] This antedates William Smith's geological map of England by six years, although it was constructed using a different classification of rocks.\nSir Charles Lyell (1797–1875) first published his famous book, Principles of Geology,[82] in 1830. This book, which influenced the thought of Charles Darwin, successfully promoted the doctrine of uniformitarianism. This theory states that slow geological processes have occurred throughout the Earth's history and are still occurring today. In contrast, catastrophism is the theory that Earth's features formed in single, catastrophic events and remained unchanged thereafter. Though Hutton believed in uniformitarianism, the idea was not widely accepted at the time.\nMuch of 19th-century geology revolved around the question of the Earth's exact age. Estimates varied from a few hundred thousand to billions of years.[83] By the early 20th century, radiometric dating allowed the Earth's age to be estimated at two billion years. The awareness of this vast amount of time opened the door to new theories about the processes that shaped the planet.\nSome of the most significant advances in 20th-century geology have been the development of the theory of plate tectonics in the 1960s and the refinement of estimates of the planet's age. Plate tectonics theory arose from two separate geological observations: seafloor spreading and continental drift. The theory revolutionized the Earth sciences. Today the Earth is known to be approximately 4.5 billion years old.[16]\n-\nGeorgius Agricola, German mineralogist, founder of geology as a scientific field\n-\nMikhail Lomonosov, Russian polymath, author of the first systematic treatise in scientific geology (1763)\n-\nThe volcanologist David A.

          "content": "Geology\nGeology is the study of the nonliving things that the Earth is made of.[1][2] Geology is the study of rocks in the Earth's crust. People who study geology are called geologists.[3] Some geologists study minerals (mineralogist) and the useful substances the rocks contain such as ores and fossil fuels. Geologists also study the history of the Earth.\nSome of the important events in the Earth's history are floods, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, orogeny (mountain building), and plate tectonics (movement of continents).\nSubjects\n[change | change source]Geology is divided into special subjects that study one part of geology. Some of these subjects and what they focus on are:\n- Geomorphology – the shape of Earth's surface (its morphology)\n- Historical geology – the events that shaped the Earth over the last 4.5 billion years\n- Hydrogeology – underground water\n- Palaeontology – fossils; evolutionary histories\n- Petrology – rocks, how they form, where they are from, and what that implies\n- Mineralogy – minerals\n- Sedimentology – sediments (clays, sands, gravels, soils, etc.)\n- Stratigraphy – layered sedimentary rocks and how they were deposited\n- Petroleum geology – petroleum deposits in sedimentary rocks[4][5][6]\n- Structural geology – folds, faults, and mountain-building;[7][8][9][10][11]\n- See Earth science for details.\n- Volcanology – volcanoes on land or under the ocean\n- Seismology – earthquakes and strong ground-motion\n- Engineering geology – geologic hazards (such as landslides and earthquakes) applied to civil engineering[12][13]\n- Geotechnical engineering: It is also called Geotechnics. It is branch of geology that deals with the engineering behavior of earth materials.\nTypes of rock\n[change | change source]Rocks can be very different from each other. Some are very hard and some are soft. Some rocks are very common, while others are rare. However, all the different rocks belong to three categories or types, igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic.\n- Igneous rock is rock that has been made by volcanic action. Igneous rock is made when the lava (melted rock on the surface of the Earth) or magma (melted rock below the surface of the Earth) cools and becomes hard.\n- Sedimentary rock is rock that has been made from sediment. Sediment is solid pieces of stuff that are moved by wind, water, or glaciers, and dropped somewhere. Sediment can be made from clay, sand, gravel and the bodies and shells of animals. The sediment gets dropped in a layer, usually in water at the bottom of a river or sea. As the sediment piles up, the lowers layers get squashed together. Slowly they set hard into rock.\n- Metamorphic rock is rock that has been changed. Sometimes an igneous or a sedimentary rock is heated or squashed under the ground, so that it changes. Metamorphic rock is often harder than the rock that it was before it changed. Marble and slate are among the metamorphic rocks that people use to make things.\nFaults\n[change | change source]All three kinds of rocks can be changed by being heated and squeezed by forces in the Earth. When this happens, faults (cracks) may appear in the rock. Geologists can learn a lot about the history of the rock by studying the patterns of the fault lines. Earthquakes are caused when a fault breaks suddenly.\nSoil\n[change | change source]Soil is the stuff on the ground made of lots of particles (or tiny pieces). The particles of soil come from rocks that have broken down, and from rotting leaves and animals bodies. Soil covers a lot of the surface of the Earth. Plants of all sorts grow in soil.\nTo find out more about types of rocks, see the rock (geology) article. To find out more about soil, see the soil article.\nPrinciples of Stratigraphy\n[change | change source]Geologists use some simple ideas which help them to understand the rocks they are studying. The following ideas were worked out in the early days of stratigraphy by people like Nicolaus Steno, James Hutton and William Smith:\n- Understanding the past: Geologist James Hutton said \"The present is the key to the past\". He meant that the sort of changes that are happening to the Earth's surface now are the same sorts of things that happened in the past. Geologists can understand things that happened millions of years ago, by looking at the changes which are happening today.\n- Horizontal strata: The layers in a sedimentary rock must have been horizontal (flat) when they were deposited (laid down).\n- The age of the strata: Layers at the bottom must be older than layers at the top, unless all the rocks have been turned over.\n- In sedimentary rocks that are made of sand or gravel, the sand or gravel must have come from an older rock.\n- The age of faults: If there is a crack or fault in a rock, then the fault is younger than the rock. Rocks are in strata (lots of layers). A geologist can see if the faults go through all the layer, or only some. This helps to tell the age of the rocks.\n- The age of a rock which cuts through other rocks: If an igneous rock cuts across sedimentary layers, it must be younger than the sedimentary rock.\n- The relative age of fossils: A fossil in one rock type must be about the same age as the same type of fossil in the same type of rock in a different place. Likewise, a fossil in a rock layer below must be earlier than one in a higher layer.\nGallery\n[change | change source]-\nLayers of sedimentary rock\n-\nA fault cutting through older sedimentary rocks\n-\nA conglomerate: sedimentary rock made from white pieces of older rock, broken up and mixed with red sand at the bottom of a river.\n-\nBeaches are interesting places to study geology,\n-\n....so are caves.\n-\nA simple, important tool for the Geologist\n-\nThe geologist, David Johnston, on the side of Mount St. Helens.\n-\nA young Butcher Bird is standing on a box of rock cores that have been drilled from underground.\n-\nGeologists look at some samples of rock, to find minerals for mining.\n-\nA map showing the different soils and rocks under the Southern Ocean.

          "content": "Portal:Geology\nThe Geology Portal\nGeology (from Ancient Greek γῆ (gê) 'earth' and λoγία (-logía) 'study of, discourse') is a branch of natural science concerned with the Earth and other astronomical objects, the rocks of which they are composed, and the processes by which they change over time. Modern geology significantly overlaps all other Earth sciences, including hydrology. It is integrated with Earth system science and planetary science.\nGeology describes the structure of the Earth on and beneath its surface and the processes that have shaped that structure. Geologists study the mineralogical composition of rocks in order to get insight into their history of formation. Geology determines the relative ages of rocks found at a given location; geochemistry (a branch of geology) determines their absolute ages. By combining various petrological, crystallographic, and paleontological tools, geologists are able to chronicle the geological history of the Earth as a whole. One aspect is to demonstrate the age of the Earth. Geology provides evidence for plate tectonics, the evolutionary history of life, and the Earth's past climates.\nGeologists broadly study the properties and processes of Earth and other terrestrial planets. Geologists use a wide variety of methods to understand the Earth's structure and evolution, including fieldwork, rock description, geophysical techniques, chemical analysis, physical experiments, and numerical modelling. In practical terms, geology is important for mineral and hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation, evaluating water resources, understanding natural hazards, remediating environmental problems, and providing insights into past climate change. Geology is a major academic discipline, and it is central to geological engineering and plays an important role in geotechnical engineering.

          "content": "Geological history of Earth\nThe geological history of Earth follows the major geological events in Earth's past based on the geologic time scale, a system of chronological measurement based on the study of the planet's rock layers (stratigraphy). Earth formed approximately 4.54 billion years ago through accretion from the solar nebula, a disk-shaped mass of dust and gas remaining from the formation of the Sun, which also formed the rest of the Solar System.\nInitially, Earth was molten due to extreme volcanism and frequent collisions with other bodies. Eventually, the outer layer of the planet cooled to form a solid crust when water began accumulating in the atmosphere. The Moon formed soon afterwards, possibly as a result of the impact of a planetoid with Earth. Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere. Condensing water vapor, augmented by ice delivered from asteroids, produced the oceans. However, in 2020, researchers reported that sufficient water to fill the oceans may have always been on Earth since the beginning of the planet's formation.[1][2][3]\nAs the surface continually reshaped itself over hundreds of millions of years, continents formed and broke apart. They migrated across the surface, occasionally combining to form a supercontinent. Roughly 750 million years ago, the earliest-known supercontinent Rodinia, began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form Pannotia, 600 to 540 million years ago, then finally Pangaea, which broke apart 200 million years ago.\nThe present pattern of ice ages began about 40 million years ago, then intensified at the end of the Pliocene. The polar regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thawing, repeating every 40,000–100,000 years. The Last Glacial Period of the current ice age ended about 10,000 years ago.\nPrecambrian\n[edit]The Precambrian includes approximately 90% of geologic time. It extends from 4.6 billion years ago to the beginning of the Cambrian Period (about 539 Ma). It includes the first three of the four eons of Earth's prehistory (the Hadean, Archean, and Proterozoic) and precedes the Phanerozoic eon.[6]\nMajor volcanic events altering Earth's environment and causing extinctions may have occurred 10 times in the past 3 billion years.[7]\nHadean Eon\n[edit]During Hadean time (4.6–4 Ga), the Solar System was forming, probably within a large cloud of gas and dust around the Sun, called an accretion disc from which Earth formed 4,500 million years ago.[8] The Hadean Eon is not formally recognized, but it essentially marks the era before we have adequate record of significant solid rocks. The oldest dated zircons date from about 4,400 million years ago.[9][10][11]\nEarth was initially molten due to extreme volcanism and frequent collisions with other bodies. Eventually, the outer layer of the planet cooled to form a solid crust when water began accumulating in the atmosphere. The Moon formed soon afterwards, possibly as a result of the impact of a large planetoid with Earth.[12][13] More recent potassium isotopic studies suggest that the Moon was formed by a smaller, high-energy, high-angular-momentum giant impact cleaving off a significant portion of Earth.[14] Some of this object's mass merged with Earth, significantly altering its internal composition, and a portion was ejected into space. Some of the material survived to form the orbiting Moon. Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere. Condensing water vapor, augmented by ice delivered from comets, produced the oceans.[15] However, in 2020, researchers reported that sufficient water to fill the oceans may have always been on Earth since the beginning of the planet's formation.[1][2][3]\nDuring the Hadean the Late Heavy Bombardment occurred (approximately 4,100 to 3,800 million years ago) during which a large number of impact craters are believed to have formed on the Moon, and by inference on Earth, Mercury, Venus, and Mars as well. However, some scientists argue against this hypothetical Late Heavy Bombardment, pointing out that the conclusion has been drawn from data which are not fully representative (only a few crater hotspots on the Moon have been analyzed).[16][17]\nArchean Eon\n[edit]Earth of the early Archean (4,031 to 2,500 million years ago) may have had a different tectonic style. It is widely believed that the early Earth was dominated by vertical tectonic processes, such as stagnant lid,[19][20] heat-pipe,[21] or sagduction,[22][23][24] which eventually transitioned to plate tectonics during the planet's mid-stage evolution. However, an alternative view proposes that Earth never experienced a vertical tectonic phase and that plate tectonics have been active throughout its entire history.[25][26][27] During this time, Earth's crust cooled enough that rocks and continental plates began to form. Some scientists think because Earth was hotter in the past,[28][29] plate tectonic activity was more vigorous than it is today, resulting in a much greater rate of recycling of crustal material. This may have prevented cratonization and continent formation until the mantle cooled and convection slowed down. Others argue that the subcontinental lithospheric mantle is too buoyant to subduct and that the lack of Archean rocks is a function of erosion and subsequent tectonic events. Some geologists view the sudden increase in aluminum content in zircons as an indicator of the beginning of plate tectonics.[30]\nUnlike Proterozoic rocks, Archean rocks are distinguished by the presence of heavily metamorphosed deep-water sediments, such as graywackes, mudstones, volcanic sediments and banded iron formations. Greenstone belts are typical Archean formations, consisting of alternating high- and low-grade metamorphic rocks. The high-grade rocks were derived from volcanic island arcs, while the low-grade metamorphic rocks represent deep-sea sediments eroded from the neighboring island rocks and deposited in a forearc basin. In short, greenstone belts represent sutured protocontinents.[31]\nThe Earth's magnetic field was established 3.5 billion years ago. The solar wind flux was about 100 times the value of the modern Sun, so the presence of the magnetic field helped prevent the planet's atmosphere from being stripped away, which is what probably happened to the atmosphere of Mars. However, the field strength was lower than at present and the magnetosphere was about half the modern radius.[32]\nProterozoic Eon\n[edit]The geologic record of the Proterozoic (2,500 to 538.8 million years ago[33]) is more complete than that for the preceding Archean. In contrast to the deep-water deposits of the Archean, the Proterozoic features many strata that were laid down in extensive shallow epicontinental seas; furthermore, many of these rocks are less metamorphosed than Archean-age ones, and plenty are unaltered.[34] Study of these rocks shows that the eon featured massive, rapid continental accretion (unique to the Proterozoic), supercontinent cycles, and wholly modern orogenic activity.[35] Roughly 750 million years ago,[36] the earliest-known supercontinent Rodinia, began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form Pannotia, 600–540 Ma.[10][37]\nThe first-known glaciations occurred during the Proterozoic, one that began shortly after the beginning of the eon, while there were at least four during the Neoproterozoic, climaxing with the Snowball Earth of the Varangian glaciation.[38]\nPhanerozoic\n[edit]The Phanerozoic Eon is the current eon in the geologic timescale. It covers roughly 539 million years. During this period continents drifted apart, but eventually collected into a single landmass known as Pangea, before splitting again into the current continental landmasses.[citation needed]\nThe Phanerozoic is divided into three eras – the Paleozoic, the Mesozoic and the Cenozoic.\nMost of the evolution of multicellular life occurred during this time period.\nPaleozoic Era\n[edit]The Paleozoic era spanned roughly 539 to 251 million years ago (Ma)[39] and is subdivided into six geologic periods: from oldest to youngest, they are the Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous and Permian. Geologically, the Paleozoic starts shortly after the breakup of a supercontinent called Pannotia and at the end of a global ice age. Throughout the early Paleozoic, Earth's landmass was broken up into a substantial number of relatively small continents. Toward the end of the era, the continents gathered together into a supercontinent called Pangaea, which included most of Earth's land area.\nCambrian Period\n[edit]The Cambrian is a major division of the geologic timescale that begins about 538.8 ± 0.2 Ma.[40] Cambrian continents are thought to have resulted from the breakup of a Neoproterozoic supercontinent called Pannotia. The waters of the Cambrian period appear to have been widespread and shallow. Continental drift rates may have been anomalously high. Laurentia, Baltica and Siberia remained independent continents following the break-up of the supercontinent of Pannotia. Gondwana started to drift toward the South Pole. Panthalassa covered most of the southern hemisphere, and minor oceans included the Proto-Tethys Ocean, Iapetus Ocean and Khanty Ocean.\nOrdovician period\n[edit]The Ordovician period started at a major extinction event called the Cambrian–Ordovician extinction event some time about 485.4 ± 1.9 Ma.[10] During the Ordovician the southern continents were collected into a single continent called Gondwana. Gondwana started the period in the equatorial latitudes and, as the period progressed, drifted toward the South Pole. Early in the Ordovician the continents Laurentia, Siberia and Baltica were still independent continents (since the break-up of the supercontinent Pannotia earlier), but Baltica began to move toward Laurentia later in the period, causing the Iapetus Ocean to shrink between them. Also, Avalonia broke free from Gondwana and began to head north toward Laurentia. The Rheic Ocean was formed as a result of this. By the end of the period, Gondwana had neared or approached the pole and was largely glaciated.[citation needed]\nThe Ordovician came to a close in a series of extinction events that, taken together, comprise the second-largest of the five major extinction events in Earth's history in terms of percentage of genera that became extinct. The only larger one was the Permian-Triassic extinction event. The extinctions occurred approximately 447 to 444 million years ago [10] and mark the boundary between the Ordovician and the following Silurian Period.\nThe most-commonly accepted theory is that these events were triggered by the onset of an ice age, in the Hirnantian faunal stage that ended the long, stable greenhouse conditions typical of the Ordovician. The ice age was probably not as long-lasting as once thought; study of oxygen isotopes in fossil brachiopods shows that it was probably no longer than 0.5 to 1.5 million years.[41] The event was preceded by a fall in atmospheric carbon dioxide (from 7000ppm to 4400ppm) which selectively affected the shallow seas where most organisms lived. As the southern supercontinent Gondwana drifted over the South Pole, ice caps formed on it. Evidence of these ice caps has been detected in Upper Ordovician rock strata of North Africa and then-adjacent northeastern South America, which were south-polar locations at the time.[citation needed]\nSilurian Period\n[edit]The Silurian is a major division of the geologic timescale that started about 443.8 ± 1.5 Ma.[10] During the Silurian, Gondwana continued a slow southward drift to high southern latitudes, but there is evidence that the Silurian ice caps were less extensive than those of the late Ordovician glaciation. The melting of ice caps and glaciers contributed to a rise in sea levels, recognizable from the fact that Silurian sediments overlie eroded Ordovician sediments, forming an unconformity. Other cratons and continent fragments drifted together near the equator, starting the formation of a second supercontinent known as Euramerica. The vast ocean of Panthalassa covered most of the northern hemisphere. Other minor oceans include Proto-Tethys, Paleo-Tethys, Rheic Ocean, a seaway of Iapetus Ocean (now in between Avalonia and Laurentia), and newly formed Ural Ocean.\nDevonian Period\n[edit]The Devonian spanned roughly from 419 to 359 Ma.[10] The period was a time of great tectonic activity, as Laurasia and Gondwana drew closer together. The continent Euramerica (or Laurussia) was created in the early Devonian by the collision of Laurentia and Baltica, which rotated into the natural dry zone along the Tropic of Capricorn. In these near-deserts, the Old Red Sandstone sedimentary beds formed, made red by the oxidized iron (hematite) characteristic of drought conditions. Near the equator Pangaea began to consolidate from the plates containing North America and Europe, further raising the northern Appalachian Mountains and forming the Caledonian Mountains in Great Britain and Scandinavia. The southern continents remained tied together in the supercontinent of Gondwana. The remainder of modern Eurasia lay in the Northern Hemisphere. Sea levels were high worldwide, and much of the land lay submerged under shallow seas. The deep, enormous Panthalassa (the \"universal ocean\") covered the rest of the planet. Other minor oceans were Paleo-Tethys, Proto-Tethys, Rheic Ocean and Ural Ocean (which was closed during the collision with Siberia and Baltica).\nCarboniferous Period\n[edit]The Carboniferous extends from about 358.9 ± 0.4 to about 298.9 ± 0.15 Ma.[10]\nA global drop in sea level at the end of the Devonian reversed early in the Carboniferous; this created the widespread epicontinental seas and carbonate deposition of the Mississippian. There was also a drop in south polar temperatures; southern Gondwana was glaciated throughout the period, though it is uncertain if the ice sheets were a holdover from the Devonian or not. These conditions apparently had little effect in the deep tropics, where lush coal swamps flourished within 30 degrees of the northernmost glaciers. A mid-Carboniferous drop in sea-level precipitated a major marine extinction, one that hit crinoids and ammonites especially hard. This sea-level drop and the associated unconformity in North America separate the Mississippian Period from the Pennsylvanian period.[42]\nThe Carboniferous was a time of active mountain building, as the supercontinent Pangea came together. The southern continents remained tied together in the supercontinent Gondwana, which collided with North America-Europe (Laurussia) along the present line of eastern North America. This continental collision resulted in the Hercynian orogeny in Europe, and the Alleghenian orogeny in North America; it also extended the newly uplifted Appalachians southwestward as the Ouachita Mountains.[43] In the same time frame, much of present eastern Eurasian Plate welded itself to Europe along the line of the Ural Mountains. There were two major oceans in the Carboniferous: the Panthalassa and Paleo-Tethys. Other minor oceans were shrinking and eventually closed the Rheic Ocean (closed by the assembly of South and North America), the small, shallow Ural Ocean (which was closed by the collision of Baltica, and Siberia continents, creating the Ural Mountains) and Proto-Tethys Ocean.\nPermian Period\n[edit]The Permian extends from about 298.9 ± 0.15 to 252.17 ± 0.06 Ma.[10]\nDuring the Permian all Earth's major landmasses, except portions of East Asia, were collected into a single supercontinent known as Pangaea. Pangaea straddled the equator and extended toward the poles, with a corresponding effect on ocean currents in the single great ocean (Panthalassa, the universal sea), and the Paleo-Tethys Ocean, a large ocean that was between Asia and Gondwana. The Cimmeria continent rifted away from Gondwana and drifted north to Laurasia, causing the Paleo-Tethys to shrink. A new ocean was growing on its southern end, the Tethys Ocean, an ocean that would dominate much of the Mesozoic Era. Large continental landmasses create climates with extreme variations of heat and cold (\"continental climate\") and monsoon conditions with highly seasonal rainfall patterns. Deserts seem to have been widespread on Pangaea.\nMesozoic Era\n[edit]The Mesozoic extended roughly from 252 to 66 million years ago.[10]\nAfter the vigorous convergent plate mountain-building of the late Paleozoic, Mesozoic tectonic deformation was comparatively mild. Nevertheless, the era featured the dramatic rifting of the supercontinent Pangaea. Pangaea gradually split into a northern continent, Laurasia, and a southern continent, Gondwana. This created the passive continental margin that characterizes most of the Atlantic coastline (such as along the U.S. East Coast) today.\nTriassic Period\n[edit]The Triassic Period extends from about 252.17 ± 0.06 to 201.3 ± 0.2 Ma.[10] During the Triassic, almost all Earth's landmass was concentrated into a single supercontinent centered more or less on the equator, called Pangaea (\"all the land\"). This took the form of a giant \"Pac-Man\" with an east-facing \"mouth\" constituting the Tethys sea, a vast gulf that opened farther westward in the mid-Triassic, at the expense of the shrinking Paleo-Tethys Ocean, an ocean that existed during the Paleozoic.\nThe remainder was the world-ocean known as Panthalassa (\"all the sea\"). All the deep-ocean sediments laid down during the Triassic have disappeared through subduction of oceanic plates; thus, very little is known of the Triassic open ocean. The supercontinent Pangaea was rifting during the Triassic—especially late in the period—but had not yet separated. The first nonmarine sediments in the rift that marks the initial break-up of Pangea—which separated New Jersey from Morocco—are of Late Triassic age; in the U.S., these thick sediments comprise the Newark Supergroup.[44] Because of the limited shoreline of one super-continental mass, Triassic marine deposits are globally relatively rare; despite their prominence in Western Europe, where the Triassic was first studied. In North America, for example, marine deposits are limited to a few exposures in the west. Thus Triassic stratigraphy is mostly based on organisms living in lagoons and hypersaline environments, such as Estheria crustaceans and terrestrial vertebrates.[45]\nJurassic Period\n[edit]The Jurassic Period extends from about 201.3 ± 0.2 to 145.0 Ma.[10] During the early Jurassic, the supercontinent Pangaea broke up into the northern supercontinent Laurasia and the southern supercontinent Gondwana; the Gulf of Mexico opened in the new rift between North America and what is now Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. The Jurassic North Atlantic Ocean was relatively narrow, while the South Atlantic did not open until the following Cretaceous Period, when Gondwana itself rifted apart.[46] The Tethys Sea closed, and the Neotethys basin appeared. Climates were warm, with no evidence of glaciation. As in the Triassic, there was apparently no land near either pole, and no extensive ice caps existed. The Jurassic geological record is good in western Europe, where extensive marine sequences indicate a time when much of the continent was submerged under shallow tropical seas; famous locales include the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site and the renowned late Jurassic lagerstätten of Holzmaden and Solnhofen.[47] In contrast, the North American Jurassic record is the poorest of the Mesozoic, with few outcrops at the surface.[48] Though the epicontinental Sundance Sea left marine deposits in parts of the northern plains of the United States and Canada during the late Jurassic, most exposed sediments from this period are continental, such as the alluvial deposits of the Morrison Formation. The first of several massive batholiths were emplaced in the northern Cordillera beginning in the mid-Jurassic, marking the Nevadan orogeny.[49] Important Jurassic exposures are also found in Russia, India, South America, Japan, Australasia and the United Kingdom.\nCretaceous Period\n[edit]The Cretaceous Period extends from circa 145 million years ago to 66 million years ago.[10]\nDuring the Cretaceous, the late Paleozoic-early Mesozoic supercontinent of Pangaea completed its breakup into present day continents, although their positions were substantially different at the time. As the Atlantic Ocean widened, the convergent-margin orogenies that had begun during the Jurassic continued in the North American Cordillera, as the Nevadan orogeny was followed by the Sevier and Laramide orogenies. Though Gondwana was still intact in the beginning of the Cretaceous, Gondwana itself broke up as South America, Antarctica and Australia rifted away from Africa (though India and Madagascar remained attached to each other); thus, the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans were newly formed. Such active rifting lifted great undersea mountain chains along the welts, raising eustatic sea levels worldwide.\nTo the north of Africa the Tethys Sea continued to narrow. Broad shallow seas advanced across central North America (the Western Interior Seaway) and Europe, then receded late in the period, leaving thick marine deposits sandwiched between coal beds. At the peak of the Cretaceous transgression, one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged.[50] The Cretaceous is justly famous for its chalk; indeed, more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the Phanerozoic.[51] Mid-ocean ridge activity—or rather, the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium; this made the oceans more saturated, as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for calcareous nanoplankton.[52] These widespread carbonates and other sedimentary deposits make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine. Famous formations from North America include the rich marine fossils of Kansas's Smoky Hill Chalk Member and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation. Other important Cretaceous exposures occur in Europe and China. In the area that is now India, massive lava beds called the Deccan Traps were laid down in the very late Cretaceous and early Paleocene.\nCenozoic Era\n[edit]The Cenozoic Era covers the 66 million years since the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event up to and including the present day. By the end of the Mesozoic era, the continents had rifted into nearly their present form. Laurasia became North America and Eurasia, while Gondwana split into South America, Africa, Australia, Antarctica and the Indian subcontinent, which collided with the Asian plate. This impact gave rise to the Himalayas. The Tethys Sea, which had separated the northern continents from Africa and India, began to close up, forming the Mediterranean Sea.\nPaleogene Period\n[edit]The Paleogene (alternatively Palaeogene) Period is a unit of geologic time that began 66 and ended 23.03 Ma[10] and comprises the first part of the Cenozoic Era. This period consists of the Paleocene, Eocene and Oligocene Epochs.\nPaleocene Epoch\n[edit]The Paleocene, lasted from 66 million years ago to 56 million years ago.[10]\nIn many ways, the Paleocene continued processes that had begun during the late Cretaceous Period. During the Paleocene, the continents continued to drift toward their present positions. Supercontinent Laurasia had not yet separated into three continents. Europe and Greenland were still connected. North America and Asia were still intermittently joined by a land bridge, while Greenland and North America were beginning to separate.[53] The Laramide orogeny of the late Cretaceous continued to uplift the Rocky Mountains in the American west, which ended in the succeeding epoch. South and North America remained separated by equatorial seas (they joined during the Neogene); the components of the former southern supercontinent Gondwana continued to split apart, with Africa, South America, Antarctica and Australia pulling away from each other. Africa was heading north toward Europe, slowly closing the Tethys Ocean, and India began its migration to Asia that would lead to a tectonic collision and the formation of the Himalayas.\nEocene Epoch\n[edit]During the Eocene (56 million years ago - 33.9 million years ago),[10] the continents continued to drift toward their present positions. At the beginning of the period, Australia and Antarctica remained connected, and warm equatorial currents mixed with colder Antarctic waters, distributing the heat around the world and keeping global temperatures high. But when Australia split from the southern continent around 45 Ma, the warm equatorial currents were deflected away from Antarctica, and an isolated cold water channel developed between the two continents. The Antarctic region cooled down, and the ocean surrounding Antarctica began to freeze, sending cold water and ice floes north, reinforcing the cooling. The present pattern of ice ages began about 40 million years ago.[54]\nThe northern supercontinent of Laurasia began to break up, as Europe, Greenland and North America drifted apart. In western North America, mountain building started in the Eocene, and huge lakes formed in the high flat basins among uplifts. In Europe, the Tethys Sea finally vanished, while the uplift of the Alps isolated its final remnant, the Mediterranean, and created another shallow sea with island archipelagos to the north. Though the North Atlantic was opening, a land connection appears to have remained between North America and Europe since the faunas of the two regions are very similar. India continued its journey away from Africa and began its collision with Asia, creating the Himalayan orogeny.\nOligocene Epoch\n[edit]The Oligocene Epoch extends from about 34 million years ago to 23 million years ago.[10] During the Oligocene the continents continued to drift toward their present positions.\nAntarctica continued to become more isolated and finally developed a permanent ice cap. Mountain building in western North America continued, and the Alps started to rise in Europe as the African Plate continued to push north into the Eurasian Plate, isolating the remnants of Tethys Sea. A brief marine incursion marks the early Oligocene in Europe. There appears to have been a land bridge in the early Oligocene between North America and Europe since the faunas of the two regions are very similar. During the Oligocene, South America was finally detached from Antarctica and drifted north toward North America. It also allowed the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to flow, rapidly cooling the continent.\nNeogene Period\n[edit]The Neogene Period is a unit of geologic time starting 23.03 Ma.[10] and ends at 2.588 Ma. The Neogene Period follows the Paleogene Period. The Neogene consists of the Miocene and Pliocene and is followed by the Quaternary Period.\nMiocene Epoch\n[edit]The Miocene extends from about 23.03 to 5.333 Ma.[10]\nDuring the Miocene continents continued to drift toward their present positions. Of the modern geologic features, only the land bridge between South America and North America was absent, the subduction zone along the Pacific Ocean margin of South America caused the rise of the Andes and the southward extension of the Meso-American peninsula. India continued to collide with Asia. The Tethys Seaway continued to shrink and then disappeared as Africa collided with Eurasia in the Turkish-Arabian region between 19 and 12 Ma (ICS 2004). Subsequent uplift of mountains in the western Mediterranean region and a global fall in sea levels combined to cause a temporary drying up of the Mediterranean Sea resulting in the Messinian salinity crisis near the end of the Miocene.\nPliocene Epoch\n[edit]The Pliocene extends from 5.333 million years ago to 2.588 million years ago.[10] During the Pliocene continents continued to drift toward their present positions, moving from positions possibly as far as 250 kilometres (155 mi) from their present locations to positions only 70 km from their current locations.\nSouth America became linked to North America through the Isthmus of Panama during the Pliocene, bringing a nearly complete end to South America's distinctive marsupial faunas. The formation of the Isthmus had major consequences on global temperatures, since warm equatorial ocean currents were cut off and an Atlantic cooling cycle began, with cold Arctic and Antarctic waters dropping temperatures in the now-isolated Atlantic Ocean. Africa's collision with Europe formed the Mediterranean Sea, cutting off the remnants of the Tethys Ocean. Sea level changes exposed the land-bridge between Alaska and Asia. Near the end of the Pliocene, about 2.58 million years ago (the start of the Quaternary Period), the current ice age began. The polar regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating every 40,000–100,000 years.\nQuaternary Period\n[edit]Pleistocene Epoch\n[edit]The Pleistocene extends from 2.588 million years ago to 11,700 years before present.[10] The modern continents were essentially at their present positions during the Pleistocene, the plates upon which they sit probably having moved no more than 100 kilometres (62 mi) relative to each other since the beginning of the period.\nHolocene Epoch\n[edit]The Holocene Epoch began approximately 11,700 calendar years before present[10] and continues to the present. During the Holocene, continental motions have been less than a kilometer.\nThe last glacial period of the current ice age ended about 10,000 years ago.[55] Ice melt caused world sea levels to rise about 35 metres (115 ft) in the early part of the Holocene. In addition, many areas above about 40 degrees north latitude had been depressed by the weight of the Pleistocene glaciers and rose as much as 180 metres (591 ft) over the late Pleistocene and Holocene, and are still rising today. The sea level rise and temporary land depression allowed temporary marine incursions into areas that are now far from the sea. Holocene marine fossils are known from Vermont, Quebec, Ontario and Michigan. Other than higher latitude temporary marine incursions associated with glacial depression, Holocene fossils are found primarily in lakebed, floodplain and cave deposits. Holocene marine deposits along low-latitude coastlines are rare because the rise in sea levels during the period exceeds any likely upthrusting of non-glacial origin. Post-glacial rebound in Scandinavia resulted in the emergence of coastal areas around the Baltic Sea, including much of Finland. The region continues to rise, still causing weak earthquakes across Northern Europe. The equivalent event in North America was the rebound of Hudson Bay, as it shrank from its larger, immediate post-glacial Tyrrell Sea phase, to near its present boundaries.\nSee also\n[edit]- Astronomical chronology\n- Chronological dating, archaeological chronology\n- Geochronology\n- General\n- Consilience, evidence from independent, unrelated sources can \"converge\" on strong conclusions\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ a b Piani, Laurette (28 August 2020). \"Earth's water may have been inherited from material similar to enstatite chondrite meteorites\".

          "content": "Geology of the United States\nThe richly textured landscape of the United States is a product of the dueling forces of plate tectonics, weathering and erosion. Over the 4.5 billion-year history of the Earth, tectonic upheavals and colliding plates have raised great mountain ranges while the forces of erosion and weathering worked to tear them down. Even after many millions of years, records of Earth's great upheavals remain imprinted as textural variations and surface patterns that define distinctive landscapes or provinces.[1]\nThe diversity of the landscapes of the United States can be easily seen on the shaded relief image to the right. The stark contrast between the 'rough' texture of the western US and the 'smooth' central and eastern regions is immediately apparent. Differences in roughness (topographic relief) result from a variety of processes acting on the underlying rock. The plate tectonic history of a region strongly influences the rock type and structure exposed at the surface, but differing rates of erosion that accompany changing climates can also have profound impacts on the land.[1]\nThere are twelve main geological provinces in the United States: Pacific, Columbia Plateau, Basin and Range, Colorado Plateau, Rocky Mountains, Laurentian Upland, Interior Plains, Interior Highlands, Appalachian Highlands, Atlantic Plain, Alaskan, and Hawaiian. Each province has its own geologic history and unique features.[1] This article will describe each province in turn.\nPacific Province\n[edit]This region is one of the most geologically young and tectonically active in North America. The generally rugged, mountainous landscape of this province provides evidence of ongoing mountain-building.[2]\nThe Pacific Province straddles the boundaries between several of Earth's moving plates:the source of the monumental forces required to build the sweeping arc of mountains that extends from Alaska to the southern reaches of South America. This province includes the active and sometimes deadly volcanoes of the Cascade Range and the young, steep mountains of the Pacific Border and the Sierra Nevada.[2]\nSierra Nevada\n[edit]Although the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Range form a nearly continuous barrier along the western edge of the United States, the two ranges really have very little in common. They have been and continue to be formed by quite different geological forces and processes.[2]\nThe rocks that form the backbone of the Sierra Nevada are mostly granitic rocks that formed during the Mesozoic Era, when non-avian dinosaurs roamed the Earth. At that time, an arc-shaped chain of volcanoes, similar to the present-day Cascade volcanic arc, erupted where the Sierra Nevada now stands. Rising through older Paleozoic rock, molten rock erupted at the surface as lava, but most solidified deep within the earth, forming the gray granitic rocks familiar to any Sierra traveler.[2]\nAlthough from a distance the Sierran rock looks quite similar, it is actually made up of many individual rock bodies that formed from repeated intrusions of magma over many millions of years.[2]\nEven as they grew, erosion was wearing away these Mesozoic Era volcanoes. By Late Cretaceous time, about 70 million years ago, the once-deep granitic rocks began to be exposed at the Earth's surface. By a few tens of millions of years ago, so much of the upper part had worn away that the surface of the ancient range had a low relief of just a few thousand feet.[2]\nIt wasn't until quite recently, geologically speaking, that the Sierra Nevada range as we know it today began to grow. During the Miocene Epoch, less than 20 million years ago, the continental crust east of the Sierra Nevada began to stretch in an east–west direction. The crust broke into a series of north–south-trending valleys and mountain ranges: the beginning of the Basin and Range province.[2]\nLess than five million years ago, the range that we now know as the Sierra Nevada began to rise along its eastern margin. Through a combination of uplift of the Sierran block and down-dropping of the area to the east, the Sierra rose upward. Rising far more steeply to the east than the west, the entire Sierra Nevada can be thought of as an enormous tilted fault block with a long, gentle slope westward to California's Central Valley and steep eastern slope.[2]\nNot long after the Sierra uplift began, the Earth cooled, marking the beginning of the Pleistocene (Ice Age) Epoch. Glaciers grew in the Sierra highlands and made their way down former stream channels, carving U-shaped valleys. The sheer walls and hanging valleys of Yosemite National Park are a product of this chilly past.[2]\nCascades Volcanic Province\n[edit]Where the Sierra Nevada ends, a chain of explosive volcanic centers, the Cascade volcanoes, begins. The Cascades Province forms an arc-shaped band extending from British Columbia to Northern California, roughly parallel to the Pacific coastline. Within this region, 13 major volcanic centers lie in sequence like a string of explosive pearls.[3]\nAlthough the largest volcanoes like Mount St. Helens get the most attention, the Cascades is really made up of a band of thousands of very small, short-lived volcanoes that have built a platform of lava and volcanic debris. Rising above this volcanic platform are a few strikingly large volcanoes that dominate the landscape.[3]\nThe Cascades volcanoes define the Pacific Northwest section of the Ring of Fire, an array of volcanoes that rim the Pacific Ocean. As if volcanic hazards were not enough, the Ring of Fire is also infamous for its frequent earthquakes. In order to understand the origins of this concentrated band of Earth hazards, we have to slice deep into the Earth.[4]\nA slice of the Earth from the Pacific Ocean through the Pacific Northwest might look something like the adjacent image. Beneath the Cascades, a dense oceanic plate plunges beneath the North American plate; a process known as subduction. As the oceanic slab sinks deep into the Earth's interior beneath the continental plate, high temperatures and pressures allow water molecules locked in the minerals of solid rock to escape. The water vapor rises into the pliable mantle above the subducting plate, causing some of the mantle to melt. This newly formed magma rises toward the Earth's surface to erupt, forming a chain of volcanoes (the Cascade Range) above the subduction zone.[4]\nA close-up look at the Cascades reveals a more complicated picture than the simple subduction zone shown in the image on the left. Not far off the coast of the North Pacific lies a spreading ridge; a divergent plate boundary made up of a series of breaks in the oceanic crust where new ocean crust is created. On one side of the spreading ridge new Pacific plate crust is made, then moves away from the ridge. On the other side of the spreading ridge the Juan de Fuca plate and Gorda plate move eastward.[4]\nThere are some unusual features at the Cascade subduction zone. Where the Juan de Fuca plate sinks beneath the North American plate there is no deep trench, seismicity (earthquakes) are fewer than expected, and there is evidence of a decline in volcanic activity over the past few million years. The probable explanation lies in the rate of convergence between the Juan de Fuca and North American plates. These two plates converge at 3–4 centimeters per year at present. This is only about half the rate of convergence of 7 million years ago.[4]\nThe small Juan de Fuca plate and two platelets, the Explorer plate and Gorda plate are the meager remnants of the much larger Farallon oceanic plate. The Explorer plate broke away from the Juan de Fuca about 4 million years ago and shows no evidence that it is still being subducted. The Gorda platelet split away between 18 and 5 million years ago and continues to sink beneath North America.[4]\nThe Cascade Range made its first appearance 36 million years ago, but the major peaks that rise up from today's volcanic centers were born within the last 1.6 million years (during the Pleistocene). More than 3000 vents erupted during the most recent volcanic episode that began 5 million years ago. As long as subduction continues, new Cascade volcanoes will continue to rise.[4]\nColumbia Plateau\n[edit]The Columbia Plateau province is enveloped by one of the world's largest accumulations of lava. Over 500,000 km2 (190,000 sq mi) of the Earth's surface is covered by it, an area roughly the size of the country of Spain. The topography here is dominated by geologically young lava flows that inundated the countryside with amazing speed, all within the last 17 million years.[5]\nOver 170,000 km3 (41,000 cu mi) of basaltic lava, known as the Columbia River basalts, covers the western part of the province. These tremendous flows erupted between 17 and 6 million years ago. Most of the lava flooded out in the first 1.5 million years: an extraordinarily short time for such an outpouring of molten rock.[5]\nThe Snake River Plain stretches across Oregon, through northern Nevada, southern Idaho, and ends at the Yellowstone Plateau in Wyoming. Looking like a great spoon scooped out the Earth surface, the smooth topography of this province forms a striking contrast with the strong mountainous fabric around it.[5]\nThe Snake River Plain lies in a distinct depression. At the western end, the base has dropped down along normal faults, forming a graben structure. Although there is extensive faulting at the eastern end, the structure is not as clear.[5]\nLike the Columbia River region, volcanic eruptions dominate the story of the Snake River Plain in the eastern part of the Columbia Plateau Province. The earliest Snake River Plain eruptions began about 15 million years ago, just as the tremendous early eruptions of Columbia River Basalt were ending. But most of the Snake River Plain volcanic rock is less than a few million years old, Pliocene age (5–1.6 million years ago) and younger.[5]\nIn the west, the Columbia River Basalts are just that-almost exclusively black basalt. Not so in the Snake River Plain, where relatively quiet eruptions of soupy black basalt lava flows alternated with tremendous explosive eruptions of rhyolite, a light-colored volcanic rock.[5]\nCinder cones dot the landscape of the Snake River Plain. Some are aligned along vents, the fissures that fed flows and cone-building eruptions. Calderas, great pits formed by explosive volcanism, and low shield volcanoes, and rhyolite hills are also part of the landscape here, but many are obscured by later lava flows.[5]\nGeologists usually associate volcanic eruptions with the boundaries between colliding or diverging plates. However, the focus of volcanism at Yellowstone in the Columbia Plateau Province is far inland from the subduction zone that lies along the Oregon and Washington coast. Evidence suggests that some concentrated heat source is melting rock beneath the Columbia Plateau Province, at the base of the lithosphere (the layer of crust and upper mantle that forms Earth's moving tectonic plates). In an effort to figure out why this area, far from a plate boundary, had such an enormous outpouring of lava, scientists established hardening dates for many of the individual lava flows. They found that the youngest volcanic rocks were clustered near the Yellowstone Plateau, and that the farther west they went, the older the lavas.[5]\nA probable explanation is that a hot spot, an extremely hot plume of deep mantle material, is rising to the surface beneath the Columbia Plateau Province. We know that beneath Hawaii and Iceland, a temperature instability develops (for reasons not yet well understood) at the boundary between the core and mantle. The concentrated heat triggers a plume hundreds of kilometers in diameter that ascends directly through to the surface of the Earth.[5]\nWhen the hot plume arrives at the base of the lithosphere, some of the lighter rock of the lithosphere rapidly melts. It is this molten lithosphere that becomes the basalt lavas that gush onto the surface to form the Columbia River and Snake River Plain basalts.[5]\nThe track of this hot spot starts in the west and sweeps up to Yellowstone National Park. The steaming fumaroles and explosive geysers are ample evidence of a concentration of heat beneath the surface. The hot spot is stationary, but the North American plate is moving over it, creating a record of the rate and direction of plate motion.[5]\nBasin and Range\n[edit]The Basin and Range Province includes much of western North America. In the United States, it is bordered on the west by the eastern fault scarp of the Sierra Nevada and spans over 500 miles (800 km) to its eastern border marked by the Wasatch Fault, the Colorado Plateau and the Rio Grande Rift. The Basin and Range Province extends north to the Columbia Plateau and south as far as the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt in Mexico, though the southern boundaries of the Basin and Range are debated.[6]\nThe Basin and Range province has a characteristic topography that is familiar to anyone who ventures across it. Steep climbs up elongate mountain ranges alternate with long treks across flat, dry deserts. This basic topographic pattern extends from eastern California to central Utah, and from southern Idaho into the state of Sonora in Mexico. The forces which created this distinct topography lie deep beneath the surface.[7]\nWithin the Basin and Range Province, the Earth's crust (and upper mantle) has been stretched up to 100% of its original width. The entire region has been subjected to extension that thinned and cracked the crust as it was pulled apart, creating large faults. Along these roughly north–south-trending faults mountains were uplifted and valleys down-dropped, producing the distinctive alternating pattern of linear mountain ranges and valleys of the Basin and Range province.[7]\nAlthough there are other types of faults in the Basin and Range province, the extension and crustal stretching that have shaped the present landscape produce mostly normal faults. The upthrown side of these faults form mountains that rise abruptly and steeply, and the down-dropped side creates low valleys. The fault plane, along which the two sides of the fault move, extends deep in the crust, usually an angle of 60 degrees. In places, the relief or vertical difference between the two sides is as much as 10,000 feet (3,000 m).[7]\nAs the rocky ranges rise, they are immediately subject to weathering and erosion. The exposed bedrock is attacked by water, ice, wind and other erosional agents. Rock particles are stripped away and wash down the mountain sides, often covering young faults until they rupture again. Sediment collects in the adjacent valleys, in some places burying the bedrock under thousands of feet of rock debris.[7]\nClarence Dutton famously compared the many narrow parallel mountain ranges that distinguish the unique topography of the Basin and Range to an \"army of caterpillars marching toward Mexico\", which is a helpful way to visualize the overall appearance of the region.[8] The Basin and Range province should not be confused with The Great Basin, which is a sub-section of the greater Basin and Range physiographic region defined by its unique hydrological characteristics (internal drainage).\nGreat Basin\n[edit]The Great Basin is the geographical and hydrological region comprising most of Nevada, southern Oregon and Idaho, western Utah, and a little of eastern California. Characterized by internal drainage, this region's surface water sources evaporate or percolate before they can flow to the ocean.[7]\nThe Basin and Range province's dynamic fault history has profoundly affected the Great Basin's water drainage system. Most precipitation in the Great Basin falls in the form of snow that melts in the spring. Rain that reaches the ground, or snow that melts, quickly evaporates in the dry desert environment. Some of the water that does not evaporate sinks into the ground to become ground water. The remaining water flows into streams and collects in short-lived lakes called playas on the valley floor and eventually evaporates. Any water that falls as rain or snow into this region does not escape out of it; not one of the streams that originate within this basin ever find an outlet to the ocean. The extent of internal drainage, the area in which surface water cannot reach the ocean, defines the geographic region called the Great Basin.[7]\nThe Great Basin's internal drainage results from blockage of water movement by high fault-created mountains and by lack of sufficient water flow to merge with larger drainages outside of the Great Basin. This internally-drained area occupies approximately 200,000 square miles (520,000 km2), including most of Nevada, a large part of Utah, and portions of Idaho, California, and Oregon. Much of the present-day Great Basin would drain to the sea, just as it did in the recent Ice Ages, if there were more rain and snowfall.[7]\nColorado Plateau\n[edit]The Colorado Plateau is roughly centered on the Four Corners region of the southwestern United States. The province covers an area of 337,000 km2 (130,000 mi2) within western Colorado, northwestern New Mexico, southern and eastern Utah, and northern Arizona. About 90% of the area is drained by the Colorado River and its main tributaries: the Green, San Juan, and Little Colorado.[9][10]\nThe sculptured beauty and brilliant colors of the Colorado Plateau's sedimentary rock layers have captured the imaginations of countless geologists. This is a vast region of plateaus, mesas, and deep canyons whose walls expose rocks ranging in age from billions to just a few hundred years old.[11]\nAncient Precambrian rocks, exposed only in the deepest canyons, make up the basement of the Colorado Plateau. Most are metamorphic rocks formed deep within the Earth while continental collision on a grand scale produced the nucleus of the North American continent well over a billion years ago. Igneous rocks injected millions of years later form a marbled network through parts of the Colorado Plateau's darker metamorphic basement.[11]\nThese deeply-formed rocks were uplifted, eroded, and exposed for eons. By 600 million years ago, North America had been beveled off to a remarkably smooth surface. It is on this crystalline rock surface that the younger, more familiar layered rocks of the Colorado Plateau were deposited.[11]\nThroughout the Paleozoic Era, the Colorado Plateau region was periodically inundated by tropical seas. Thick layers of limestone, sandstone, siltstone, and shale were laid down in the shallow marine waters. During times when the seas retreated, stream deposits and dune sands were deposited or older layers were removed by erosion. Over 300 million years passed as layer upon layer of sediment accumulated.[11]\nIt was not until the upheavals that coincided with the formation of the supercontinent Pangea began about 250 million years ago that deposits of marine sediment waned and terrestrial deposits dominate. The Mesozoic Era sedimentary deposits are striking. Great accumulations of dune sand hardened to form sweeping arcs in cross-bedded sandstone. Eruptions from volcanic mountain ranges to the west buried vast regions beneath ashy debris. Short-lived rivers, lakes, and inland seas left sedimentary records of their passage.[11]\nOne of the most geologically intriguing features of the Colorado Plateau is its remarkable stability. Relatively little rock deformation (e.g., faulting and folding) has affected this high, thick crustal block within the last 600 million years or so. In contrast, the plateau is surrounded by provinces that have suffered severe deformation. Mountain building thrust up the Rocky Mountains to the north and east and tremendous, earth-stretching tension created the Basin and Range Province to the west and south.[11]\nAlthough the Basin and Range and Colorado Plateau may seem to have little in common, their geological stories are intimately intertwined. In the early part of this Era (Paleogene Period), both regions had low elevations of probably less than 1 kilometer. Geologists are still gathering evidence and debating what came next.[11]\nBeginning about 20 million years ago, during the Miocene Epoch, both the Basin and Range and Colorado Plateau regions were uplifted as much as 3 kilometers. Great tension developed in the crust, probably related to changing plate motions far to the west. As the crust stretched, the Basin and Range Province broke up into a multitude of down-dropped valleys and elongate mountains. Yet for some reason not fully understood, the neighboring Colorado Plateau was able to preserve its structural integrity and remained a single tectonic block. Eventually, the great block of Colorado Plateau crust rose a kilometer higher than the Basin and Range.[11]\nAs the land rose, the streams responded by cutting ever deeper stream channels. The most well-known of these streams, the Colorado River, began to carve the Grand Canyon less than 6 million years ago. The forces of erosion have exposed the vivid kaleidoscope of rock layers that make the Colorado Plateau a mecca for rock lovers.[11]\nRocky Mountain System\n[edit]The Rockies form a majestic mountain barrier that stretches from Canada through central New Mexico. Although formidable, a look at the topography reveals a discontinuous series of mountain ranges with distinct geological origins.[12]\nThe rocks making up the mountains were formed before the mountains were raised. The cores of the mountain ranges are in most places formed of pieces of continental crust that are over one billion years old. In the south, an older mountain range was formed 300 million years ago, then eroded away. The rocks of that older range were reformed into the Rocky Mountains.\nThe Rocky Mountains took shape during a period of intense plate tectonic activity that formed much of the rugged landscape of the western United States. Three major mountain-building episodes reshaped the west from about 170 to 40 million years ago (Jurassic to Cenozoic Periods). The last mountain building event, the Laramide orogeny, (about 70-40 million years ago) the last of the three episodes, is responsible for raising the Rocky Mountains.[12]\nDuring the last half of the Mesozoic Era, the Age of the Dinosaurs, much of today's California, Oregon, and Washington were added to North America. Western North America suffered the effects of repeated collision as slabs of ocean crust sank beneath the continental edge. Slivers of continental crust, carried along by subducting ocean plates, were swept into the subduction zone and scraped onto North America's edge.[12]\nAbout 200–300 miles inland, magma generated above the subducting slab rose into the North American continental crust. Great arc-shaped volcanic mountain ranges grew as lava and ash spewed out of dozens of individual volcanoes. Beneath the surface, great masses of molten rock were injected and hardened in place.[12]\nFor 100 million years the effects of plate collisions were focused very near the edge of the North American plate boundary, far to the west of the Rocky Mountain region. It was not until 70 million years ago that these effects began to reach the Rockies.[12]\nThe growth of the Rocky Mountains has been one of the most perplexing of geologic puzzles. Normally, mountain building is focused between 200 and 400 miles inland from a subduction zone boundary, yet the Rockies are hundreds of miles farther inland. Although geologists continue to gather evidence to explain the rise of the Rockies, the answer most likely lies with an unusual subducting slab.[12]\nAt a 'typical' subduction zone, an oceanic plate typically sinks at a fairly high angle (see above). A volcanic arc grows above the subducting plate. During the growth of the Rocky Mountains, the angle of the subducting plate may have been significantly flattened, moving the focus of melting and mountain building much farther inland than is normally expected.[12]\nIt is postulated that the shallow angle of the subducting plate greatly increased the friction and other interactions with the thick continental mass above it. Tremendous thrusts piled sheets of crust on top of each other, building the extraordinarily broad, high Rocky Mountain range.[12]\nAs of 60 million years ago, the Rockies were like Tibet: a high plateau, probably 6,000 metres (20,000 ft) above sea level. Since then, erosion stripped away the high rocks, revealing the ancestral rocks beneath, and forming the current landscape of the Rockies.[13] Periods of glaciation occurred from the Pleistocene Epoch (1.8 million–70,000 years ago) to the Holocene Epoch (fewer than 11,000 years ago). The ice ages left their mark on the Rockies, forming extensive glacial landforms, such as U-shaped valleys and cirques.[14]\nLaurentian Upland\n[edit]Every continent has a core of very ancient metamorphic rocks. The Superior Upland Province is the southern extension of the Laurentian Upland Province, part of the nucleus of North America called the Canadian Shield. The basement rocks of the Laurentian Upland Province were metamorphosed about 2500 million years ago in a mountain-building collision of tectonic plates called the Kenoran Orogeny.[15]\nThe rocks of the Superior Upland are mostly Precambrian metamorphic rocks and overlying Paleozoic rocks (Cambrian) covered by a thin veneer of glacial deposits left behind when glaciers melted at the end of the Pleistocene Ice Age. If we could strip away all of the younger rocks deposited on top of buried Precambrian basement, you would see a landscape of low relief. The topography of the Precambrian rocks is very subdued, with barely 500 feet difference between the highest point and the lowest. Clearly, this region was exposed to a very long period of erosion in the very distant past which beveled the original mountainous surface to a gently undulating surface. The present surface is not much different. Hills rise just a few hundred feet above the surrounding countryside. The highest of these, such as Rib Hill, Wisconsin, are made up mostly of resistant quartzite or granite.[15]\nThe structure of Superior Upland rock is quite complex. Folds and faults, most dating back to Precambrian time, record several episodes of mountain-building. The plate collisions that formed the core of our continent left behind a striking structural trend. Ridges and valleys are strongly aligned along this northeast–southwest trend. Lake Superior is an example of this northeast–southwest structural trend. Ridges of erosion-resistant rock rise above valleys and carved into weaker rock units.[15]\nThe effects of repeated glaciation have left their mark on the Superior Upland. The present glacial topography is the product of the most recent glaciation that ended just 10,000 years ago. During the Late Wisconsin, the last glaciation of the Pleistocene Epoch, a massive continental ice sheet grew first in the north, then gradually expanded southward. Several thick finger-like lobes of glacial ice engulfed the region as they moved through the Superior basin. Rocks of all sizes were plucked and scoured from farther north and carried along by the icy mass. When the continental ice sheets melt, they left behind an assortment of rock called glacial drift that covers much of the Superior Upland landscape.[15]\nInterior Plains\n[edit]The Interior Plains is a vast region that spreads across the stable core of North America. This area had formed when several small continents collided and welded together well over a billion years ago, during the Precambrian. Precambrian metamorphic and igneous rocks now form the basement of the Interior Plains and make up the stable nucleus of North America. With the exception of the Black Hills of South Dakota, the entire region has low relief, reflecting more than 500 million years of relative tectonic stability.[16]\nThroughout the Paleozoic and Mesozoic Eras the mostly low-lying Interior Plains region remained relatively unaffected by the mountain-building tectonic collisions suffered by the western and eastern margins of the continent.[16]\nDuring much of the Mesozoic Era, the North American continental interior was mostly well above sea level, with two notable exceptions. During part of the Jurassic (208-144 million years ago), rising seas flooded the low-lying areas of the continent. Much of the Interior Plains eventually lay submerged beneath the shallow Sundance Sea.[16]\nSediments eroding from the rising Rocky Mountains to the west washed into the sea and deposited as layered wedges of fine debris. As sand, mud, and clays accumulated, the Sundance Sea retreated northward. Preserved within the multi-hued sandstones, mudstones, and clays that made up the shoreline, are the remains of countless dinosaurs that roamed the Sundance coast.[16]\nThe fossil assemblages concealed within the sedimentary layers of the Morrison Formation are among the world's richest. In some areas, bones of many dinosaurs are concentrated in a very small area, indicating that they were carried during floods, then deposited together beside a stream.[16]\nOnce again, during the Cretaceous Period (144-65 million years ago), record high sea levels flooded the continental interior with shallow seas.[16]\nThe Interior Plains continued to receive deposits from the eroding Rocky Mountains to the west and Appalachian and Ozark/Ouachita Mountains to the east and south throughout the most recent Era, the Cenozoic. The flatness of the Interior Plains is a reflection of the platform of mostly flat-lying marine and stream deposits laid down in the Mesozoic and Cenozoic Eras.[16]\nAppalachians, Interior Highlands, and Atlantic Plains\n[edit]The rocks of the Appalachian, Ouachita, Ozark Mountains are old and share a common origin. They largely consist of sedimentary rocks of Paleozoic age that were deposited on the sea floor and are presently folded and faulted. The Appalachians also have volcanic rocks and slivers of ancient sea floor.[18] These mountains were once part of a mighty uplifted mountain range that stretch from the Appalachian Highlands through Texas.[19]\nDuring the earliest Paleozoic Era, the continent that would later become North America straddled the equator. The Appalachian region was a passive plate margin, not unlike today's Atlantic Coastal Plain Province. During this interval, the region was periodically submerged beneath shallows seas. Thick layers of sediment and carbonate rock was deposited on the shallow sea bottom when the region was submerged. When seas receded, terrestrial sedimentary deposits and erosion dominated.[18]\nDuring the middle Ordovician Period (about 440–480 million years ago), a change in plate motions set the stage for the first Paleozoic mountain building event (Taconic orogeny) in North America. The once quiet, Appalachian passive margin changed to a very active plate boundary when a neighboring oceanic plate, the Iapetus, collided with and began sinking beneath the North American craton. With the birth of this new subduction zone, the early Appalachians were born.[18]\nAlong the continental margin, volcanoes grew, coincident with the initiation of subduction. Thrust faulting uplifted and warped older sedimentary rock laid down on the passive margin. As mountains rose, erosion began to wear them down. Streams carried rock debris downslope to be deposited in nearby lowlands.[18]\nThis was just the first of a series of mountain building plate collisions that contributed to the formation of the Appalachians. Mountain building continued periodically throughout the next 250 million years (Caledonian, Acadian, Ouachita, Hercynian, and Alleghenian orogenies). The Pangean supercontinent began to take shape. Microplates, smaller bits of crust too small to be called continents, were swept in, one by one, to be welded to the growing mass.[18]\nBy about 300 million years ago (Pennsylvanian Period) Africa was approaching North American craton. The collisional belt spread into the Ozark-Ouachita region and through the Marathon Mountains of Texas. Continent vs. continent collision raised the Appalachian-Ouachita chain to lofty, Himalayan-scale ranges. The massive bulk of Pangea was completed near the end of the Paleozoic Era (Permian Period) when Africa (Gondwana) plowed into the continental agglomeration, with the Appalachian-Ouachita mountains near the core.[18] From about 280-230 million years ago, (Late Paleozoic Era until the Late Triassic) the continent we now know as North America was continuous with Africa, South America, and Europe.[20]\nDuring the Late Triassic, Pangea began to be torn apart when a three-pronged fissure grew between Africa, South America, and North America. Rifting began as magma welled up through the weakness in the crust, creating a volcanic rift zone. Volcanic eruptions spewed ash and volcanic debris across the landscape as these severed continent-sized fragments of Pangea diverged.[20] The gash between the spreading continents gradually grew to form a new ocean basin, the Atlantic. The rift zone known as the mid-Atlantic ridge continued to provide the raw volcanic materials for the expanding ocean basin.[20]\nNorth America was slowly pulled westward away from the rift zone. The thick continental crust that made up the new east coast collapsed into a series of down-dropped fault blocks that roughly parallel today's coastline. At first, the hot, faulted edge of the continent was high and buoyant relative to the new ocean basin. As the edge of North America moved away from the hot rift zone, it began to cool and subside beneath the new Atlantic Ocean. This once-active divergent plate boundary became the passive, trailing edge of westward moving North America. In plate tectonic terms, the Atlantic Plain is known as a classic example of a passive continental margin.[20]\nDuring the rifting, South America tore away from North America and headed southward. The ocean flooded into the opening between the two continents, forming the Gulf of Mexico. A record of this rifting event remains as an indelible mark on the landscape called Mississippi Embayment. It is this embayment that ripped the dramatic gap between the southern Appalachians and the Ouachita-Ozark Highlands.[19]\nWeathering and erosion prevailed, and the mountains began to wear away.[18] By the end of the Mesozoic Era, the Appalachian-Ouachita Mountains had been eroded to an almost flat plain. Sediments eroded from these highlands were carried east and southward by streams and gradually covered the faulted continental margin, burying it under a wedge, thousands of feet thick, of layered sedimentary and volcanic debris.[20] Today most Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary rock layers that lie beneath much of the coastal plain and fringing continental shelf remain nearly horizontal or tilt gently toward the sea.[20]\nDuring the Cenozoic, the geology of the different regions diverged. The Appalachians started to uplift, while the Ouachita and Ozarks did not. The uplift rejuvenated the streams, which rapidly responded by cutting downward into the ancient bedrock. Some streams flowed along weak layers that define the folds and faults created many millions of years earlier. Other streams downcut so rapidly that they cut right across the resistant folded rocks of the mountain core, carving canyons across rock layers and geologic structures.[18]\nAlaska\n[edit]Most of Alaska consists of terranes accreted by collisions with island arcs carried in over the last 160 million years.[21] These terranes were caused by the subduction of the Farallon, Kula, and Pacific plates sequentially.[21] Currently, the Pacific plate is subducting beneath Alaska, producing the Aleutian Arc series of volcanoes through the Alaskan Peninsula and Aleutian Islands.[21]\nOne of the sutures left by terrane addition is the Denali Fault, which curves through south-central Alaska.[21] The Denali Fault bends just north of Denali. The combination of the subduction of the Pacific plate and the bend in the Denali Fault causes Denali to be the highest mountain in North America.[22]\nHawaii\n[edit]The State of Hawaii consists of a chain of islands, or archipelago. The archipelago developed as the Pacific plate moved slowly northwestward over a hotspot in the Earth's mantle at a rate of approximately 32 miles (51 km) per million years. Thus, the southeast island (Hawaiʻi) is volcanically active whereas the islands on the northwest end of the archipelago are older and typically smaller, due to longer exposure to erosion. The age of the archipelago has been estimated using potassium-argon dating methods.[23] From this study and others,[24][25] it is estimated that the northwesternmost island, the Kure Atoll, is the oldest at approximately 28 million years (Ma); while Hawaiʻi, is approximately 0.4 Ma (400,000 years). The only active volcanism in the last 200 years has been on Hawaiʻi and on the submerged but growing volcano to the extreme southeast, Kamaʻehuakanaloa (formerly Loʻihi).\nAlmost all of the magma of the hotspot has the composition of basalt, and so the Hawaiian volcanoes are composed almost entirely of this igneous rock. There is very little coarser-grained gabbro and diabase. Nephelinite is exposed on the islands but is extremely rare. The majority of eruptions in Hawaiʻi are Hawaiian-type eruptions because basaltic magma is relatively fluid compared with magmas typically involved in more explosive eruptions, such as the andesitic magmas that produce some of the spectacular and dangerous eruptions around the margins of the Pacific basin.\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ a b c This article incorporates public domain material from Geologic Provinces of the United States: Records of an Active Earth.

          "content": "Astrophysics\nAstrophysics is a science that employs the methods and principles of physics and chemistry in the study of astronomical objects and phenomena.[1][2] As one of the founders of the discipline, James Keeler, said, astrophysics \"seeks to ascertain the nature of the heavenly bodies, rather than their positions or motions in space—what they are, rather than where they are\",[3] which is studied in celestial mechanics.\nAmong the subjects studied are the Sun (solar physics), other stars, galaxies, extrasolar planets, the interstellar medium, and the cosmic microwave background.[4][5] Emissions from these objects are examined across all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, and the properties examined include luminosity, density, temperature, and chemical composition. Because astrophysics is a very broad subject, astrophysicists apply concepts and methods from many disciplines of physics, including classical mechanics, electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, relativity, nuclear and particle physics, and atomic and molecular physics.\nIn practice, modern astronomical research often involves substantial work in the realms of theoretical and observational physics. Some areas of study for astrophysicists include the properties of dark matter, dark energy, black holes, and other celestial bodies; and the origin and ultimate fate of the universe.[4] Topics also studied by theoretical astrophysicists include Solar System formation and evolution; stellar dynamics and evolution; galaxy formation and evolution; magnetohydrodynamics; large-scale structure of matter in the universe; origin of cosmic rays; general relativity, special relativity, and quantum and physical cosmology (the physical study of the largest-scale structures of the universe), including string cosmology and astroparticle physics.\nHistory\n[edit]Astronomy is an ancient science, long separated from the study of terrestrial physics. In the Aristotelian worldview, bodies in the sky appeared to be unchanging spheres whose only motion was uniform motion in a circle, while the earthly world was the realm which underwent growth and decay and in which natural motion was in a straight line and ended when the moving object reached its goal. Consequently, it was held that the celestial region was made of a fundamentally different kind of matter from that found in the terrestrial sphere; either Fire as maintained by Plato, or Aether as maintained by Aristotle.[6][7] During the 17th century, natural philosophers such as Galileo,[8] Descartes,[9] and Newton[10] began to maintain that the celestial and terrestrial regions were made of similar kinds of material and were subject to the same natural laws.[11] Their challenge was that the tools had not yet been invented with which to prove these assertions.[12]\nFor much of the nineteenth century, astronomical research was focused on the routine work of measuring the positions and computing the motions of astronomical objects.[13][14] A new astronomy, soon to be called astrophysics, began to emerge when William Hyde Wollaston and Joseph von Fraunhofer independently discovered that, when decomposing the light from the Sun, a multitude of dark lines (regions where there was less or no light) were observed in the spectrum.[15] By 1860 the physicist, Gustav Kirchhoff, and the chemist, Robert Bunsen, had demonstrated that the dark lines in the solar spectrum corresponded to bright lines in the spectra of known gases, specific lines corresponding to unique chemical elements.[16] Kirchhoff deduced that the dark lines in the solar spectrum are caused by absorption by chemical elements in the Solar atmosphere.[17] In this way it was proved that the chemical elements found in the Sun and stars were also found on Earth.\nAmong those who extended the study of solar and stellar spectra was Norman Lockyer, who in 1868 detected radiant, as well as dark lines in solar spectra. Working with chemist Edward Frankland to investigate the spectra of elements at various temperatures and pressures, he could not associate a yellow line in the solar spectrum with any known elements. He thus claimed the line represented a new element, which was called helium, after the Greek Helios, the Sun personified.[18][19]\nIn 1885, Edward C. Pickering undertook an ambitious program of stellar spectral classification at Harvard College Observatory, in which a team of woman computers, notably Williamina Fleming, Antonia Maury, and Annie Jump Cannon, classified the spectra recorded on photographic plates. By 1890, a catalog of over 10,000 stars had been prepared that grouped them into thirteen spectral types. Following Pickering's vision, by 1924 Cannon expanded the catalog to nine volumes and over a quarter of a million stars, developing the Harvard Classification Scheme which was accepted for worldwide use in 1922.[20]\nIn 1895, George Ellery Hale and James E. Keeler, along with a group of ten associate editors from Europe and the United States,[21] established The Astrophysical Journal: An International Review of Spectroscopy and Astronomical Physics.[22] It was intended that the journal would fill the gap between journals in astronomy and physics, providing a venue for publication of articles on astronomical applications of the spectroscope; on laboratory research closely allied to astronomical physics, including wavelength determinations of metallic and gaseous spectra and experiments on radiation and absorption; on theories of the Sun, Moon, planets, comets, meteors, and nebulae; and on instrumentation for telescopes and laboratories.[21]\nAround 1920, following the discovery of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram still used as the basis for classifying stars and their evolution, Arthur Eddington anticipated the discovery and mechanism of nuclear fusion processes in stars, in his paper The Internal Constitution of the Stars.[23][24] At that time, the source of stellar energy was a complete mystery; Eddington correctly speculated that the source was fusion of hydrogen into helium, liberating enormous energy according to Einstein's equation E = mc2. This was a particularly remarkable development since at that time fusion and thermonuclear energy, and even that stars are largely composed of hydrogen (see metallicity), had not yet been discovered.[25]\nIn 1925 Cecilia Helena Payne (later Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin) wrote an influential doctoral dissertation at Radcliffe College, in which she applied Saha's ionization theory to stellar atmospheres to relate the spectral classes to the temperature of stars.[26] Most significantly, she discovered that hydrogen and helium were the principal components of stars, not the composition of Earth. Despite Eddington's suggestion, discovery was so unexpected that her dissertation readers (including Russell) convinced her to modify the conclusion before publication. However, later research confirmed her discovery.[27][28]\nBy the end of the 20th century, studies of astronomical spectra had expanded to cover wavelengths extending from radio waves through optical, x-ray, and gamma wavelengths.[29] In the 21st century, it further expanded to include observations based on gravitational waves.\nObservational astrophysics\n[edit]Observational astronomy is a division of the astronomical science that is concerned with recording and interpreting data, in contrast with theoretical astrophysics, which is mainly concerned with finding out the measurable implications of physical models. It is the practice of observing celestial objects by using telescopes and other astronomical apparatus.\nMost astrophysical observations are made using the electromagnetic spectrum.\n- Radio astronomy studies radiation with a wavelength greater than a few millimeters. Example areas of study are radio waves, usually emitted by cold objects such as interstellar gas and dust clouds; the cosmic microwave background radiation which is the redshifted light from the Big Bang; pulsars, which were first detected at microwave frequencies. The study of these waves requires very large radio telescopes.\n- Infrared astronomy studies radiation with a wavelength that is too long to be visible to the naked eye but is shorter than radio waves. Infrared observations are usually made with telescopes similar to the familiar optical telescopes. Objects colder than stars (such as planets) are normally studied at infrared frequencies.\n- Optical astronomy was the earliest kind of astronomy. Telescopes paired with a charge-coupled device or spectroscopes are the most common instruments used. The Earth's atmosphere interferes somewhat with optical observations, so adaptive optics and space telescopes are used to obtain the highest possible image quality. In this wavelength range, stars are highly visible, and many chemical spectra can be observed to study the chemical composition of stars, galaxies, and nebulae.\n- Ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma ray astronomy study very energetic processes such as binary pulsars, black holes, magnetars, and many others. These kinds of radiation do not penetrate the Earth's atmosphere well. There are two methods in use to observe this part of the electromagnetic spectrum—space-based telescopes and ground-based imaging air Cherenkov telescopes (IACT). Examples of Observatories of the first type are RXTE, the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. Examples of IACTs are the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) and the MAGIC telescope.\nOther than electromagnetic radiation, few things may be observed from the Earth that originate from great distances. A few gravitational wave observatories have been constructed, but gravitational waves are extremely difficult to detect. Neutrino observatories have also been built, primarily to study the Sun. Cosmic rays consisting of very high-energy particles can be observed hitting the Earth's atmosphere.\nObservations can also vary in their time scale. Most optical observations take minutes to hours, so phenomena that change faster than this cannot readily be observed. However, historical data on some objects is available, spanning centuries or millennia. On the other hand, radio observations may look at events on a millisecond timescale (millisecond pulsars) or combine years of data (pulsar deceleration studies). The information obtained from these different timescales is very different.\nThe study of the Sun has a special place in observational astrophysics. Due to the tremendous distance of all other stars, the Sun can be observed in a kind of detail unparalleled by any other star. Understanding the Sun serves as a guide to understanding of other stars.\nThe topic of how stars change, or stellar evolution, is often modeled by placing the varieties of star types in their respective positions on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, which can be viewed as representing the state of a stellar object, from birth to destruction.\nTheoretical astrophysics\n[edit]Theoretical astrophysicists use a wide variety of tools which include analytical models (for example, polytropes to approximate the behaviors of a star) and computational numerical simulations. Each has some advantages. Analytical models of a process are generally better for giving insight into the heart of what is going on. Numerical models can reveal the existence of phenomena and effects that would otherwise not be seen.[30][31]\nTheorists in astrophysics endeavor to create theoretical models and figure out the observational consequences of those models. This helps allow observers to look for data that can refute a model or help in choosing between several alternate or conflicting models.\nTheorists also try to generate or modify models to take into account new data. In the case of an inconsistency, the general tendency is to try to make minimal modifications to the model to fit the data. In some cases, a large amount of inconsistent data over time may lead to total abandonment of a model.\nTopics studied by theoretical astrophysicists include stellar dynamics and evolution; galaxy formation and evolution; magnetohydrodynamics; large-scale structure of matter in the universe; origin of cosmic rays; general relativity and physical cosmology, including string cosmology and astroparticle physics. Relativistic astrophysics serves as a tool to gauge the properties of large-scale structures for which gravitation plays a significant role in physical phenomena investigated and as the basis for black hole (astro)physics and the study of gravitational waves.\nSome widely accepted and studied theories and models in astrophysics, now included in the Lambda-CDM model, are the Big Bang, cosmic inflation, dark matter, dark energy and fundamental theories of physics.\nPopularization\n[edit]The roots of astrophysics can be found in the seventeenth century emergence of a unified physics, in which the same laws applied to the celestial and terrestrial realms.[11] There were scientists who were qualified in both physics and astronomy who laid the firm foundation for the current science of astrophysics. In modern times, students continue to be drawn to astrophysics due to its popularization by the Royal Astronomical Society and notable educators such as prominent professors Lawrence Krauss, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, Stephen Hawking, Hubert Reeves, Carl Sagan and Patrick Moore. The efforts of the early, late, and present scientists continue to attract young people to study the history and science of astrophysics.[32][33][34] The television sitcom show The Big Bang Theory popularized the field of astrophysics with the general public, and featured some well known scientists like Stephen Hawking and Neil deGrasse Tyson.\nSee also\n[edit]- Astrochemistry – Study of molecules in the Universe and their reactions\n- Astronomical observatories\n- Astronomical spectroscopy – Measurement of electromagnetic radiation for astronomy\n- Astroparticle physics – Branch of particle physics\n- Gravitational-wave astronomy – Branch of astronomy using gravitational waves\n- Hertzsprung–Russell diagram – Scatter plot of stars showing the relationship of luminosity to stellar classification\n- High-energy astronomy – Study of astronomical objects that release highly energetic electromagnetic radiation\n- Important publications in astrophysics\n- List of astronomers – (includes astrophysicists)\n- Neutrino astronomy – Observing low-mass stellar particles\n- Timeline of gravitational physics and relativity\n- Timeline of knowledge about galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and large-scale structure\n- Timeline of white dwarfs, neutron stars, and supernovae – Chronological list of developments in knowledge and records\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ Maoz, Dan (2016).

It includes all of space, matter, energy, time, and you.\nNASA’s Astrophysics Division is dedicated to exploring the universe, pushing the boundaries of what is known of the cosmos, and sharing its discoveries with the world. The Division continues expanding humanity’s understanding of how the universe began and evolved, how it works, and whether there are places beyond Earth where life might thrive. By working together with collaborators and academic partners from all over the world, NASA researchers are making progress towards addressing the tantalizing questions below with leading-edge technologies and groundbreaking science.\nCurrent Programs\nAt NASA, a Program refers to one or more coordinated efforts of space exploration, Astrophysics comprises of three focused and two cross-cutting Programs. These focused Programs provide an intellectual framework for advancing science and conducting strategic planning.\nCurrent Missions\nThe Astrophysics current missions include two of the Great Observatories originally planned in the 1980s and launched over the past 30 years. The current suite of operational missions includes the Hubble Space Telescope, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and the James Webb Space Telescope. Additionally, the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope explores the high-energy end of the spectrum. Innovative Explorer missions, such as the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, NuSTAR, TESS, and IXPE, as well as NICER, complement the Astrophysics strategic missions. SOFIA, an airborne observatory for infrared astronomy, is in its extended mission phase is GUSTO (Galactic/ Extragalactic ULDB Spectroscopic Terahertz Observatory) with its mission to measure emissions from the interstellar medium to help scientists determine the life cycle of interstellar gas in our Milky Way, witness the formation and destruction of star-forming clouds, and understand the dynamics and gas flow in the vicinity of the center of our galaxy. All of the missions together account for much of humanity's accumulated knowledge of the heavens. Many of these missions have achieved their prime science goals but continue to produce spectacular results in their extended operations.\nNASA-funded investigators also participate in observations, data analysis and developed instruments for the astrophysics missions of our international partners, including ESA's XMM-Newton. Along with these international missions, ESA's Euclid mission which will fly NASA furnished detectors and JAXA's XRISM (X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy) mission which uses NASA furnished technologies that will help provide breakthroughs in the study of structure formation of the universe, outflows from galaxy nuclei, and dark matter.\nNear Future\nThe near future will be dominated by several missions.\nThe SPHEREx mission will launch in 2025. The Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer (SPHEREx) mission will provide the first all-sky spectral survey. Over a two-year planned mission, the SPHEREx Observatory will collect data on more than 450 million galaxies along with more than 100 million stars in the Milky Way to explore the origins of the universe.\nIn 2027 NASA will launch the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. Roman will aid researchers in their efforts to unravel the secrets of dark energy and dark matter, and explore the evolution of the cosmos. It will also discover new worlds outside our solar system and advance the search for worlds that could be suitable for life.\nIn October 2021, NASA selected a new Explorer Mission, the gamma-ray telescope COSI (Compton Spectrometer and Imager). COSI will study the recent history of star birth, star death, and the formation of chemical elements in the Milky Way. COSI is also planned to launch in 2027.\nThe Future\nSince the 2001 decadal survey, the way the universe is viewed has changed dramatically. More than 3800 planets have been discovered orbiting distant stars. Black holes are now known to be present at the center of most galaxies, including the Milky Way galaxy. The age, size and shape of the universe have been mapped based on the primordial radiation left by the big bang. And it has been learned that most of the matter in the universe is dark and invisible, and the universe is not only expanding, but accelerating in an unexpected way.\nFor the long-term future, the Astrophysics goals will be guided based on the results of the 2020 Decadal survey Pathways to Discovery in Astronomy and Astrophysics for the 2020s. It identifies the most compelling science goals and presents an ambitious program of ground- and space-based activities for future investment. The report recommends critical near-term actions to support the foundations of the profession as well as the technologies and tools needed to carry out the science.\nFeatured Missions\nJames Webb Space Telescope\nWebb is celebrating one year of incredible discoveries, from exoplanets to the early Universe.\nHubble Space Telescope\nSince its 1990 launch, the Hubble Space Telescope has changed our fundamental understanding of the universe.\nRoman Space Telescope\nRoman is designed to settle essential questions in the areas of dark energy, exoplanets, and infrared astrophysics.\nDecadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics 2020 (Astro2020)\nThe National Academies have completed their work on the 2020 Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics.\nPlease visit the National Academies Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics 2020 web page for additional information about the survey and their published documents on the topic.\nLearn More about Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics 2020 (Astro2020)",

          "content": "The Astrophysics sub-department at Oxford is one of the largest astrophysics groups in the country, with a strong and diverse research portfolio. In particular, we are internationally recognised for our observational and theoretical work on cosmology, galaxy evolution, compact objects, astrophysical fluids and exoplanets. We furthermore develop world leading radio, sub-mm, optical and IR instrumentation, providing new phase space that is ripe for scientific exploitation. We have invested in major international projects, which will deliver unprecedented datasets in the coming decade, including the European Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), and the Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We are also home to Zooniverse, the world’s largest citizen science platform. We work closely with our colleagues in the Rudolf Peierls Centre for Theoretical Physics and Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics.\nCosmology\nWe host world-leading research in both theoretical and observational cosmology at Oxford. Theoretical cosmology, housed in the Beecroft Institute of Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology, focuses on dark energy, dark matter and general relativity as well as high resolution simulations of structure formation. On the observational front, Oxford is at the forefront of survey science with prominent leadership in the next generation of surveys: the Vera Rubin Observatory (dark sector), Euclid (weak lensing), Simons Observatory (CMB). We play a leading role in C-BASS, and played an important part of the Planck team. We also lead the VISTA/VIDEO Survey and play a leading role in the KiDS weak lensing survey.\nGalaxy evolution\nOur research programme on galaxy formation and evolution spans their structure and history, from the local Milky Way to the highest redshift galaxies. Galactic dynamics underpins much of our work, understanding the dynamical processes that have led to those distributions, particularly in our own galaxy, with emphasis on the distribution of baryonic and dark matter in galaxies, and in determining the masses of nuclear black holes. Our strategy is to exploit a combination of new data with dynamical and stellar population modelling to probe the assembly history of galaxies, using large galaxy surveys (MaNGA, SAMI and WEAVE) for galaxies up to redshift 2, multi-wavelength optical-infrared-radio imaging surveys up to redshift 4, and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) for higher redshifts. We have guaranteed access to JWST’s near-infrared multi-object spectrograph NIRSpec (including its IFS capability), which will reveal the nascent stages of galaxies as they first form stars and black holes in their dark haloes.\nPulsars, transients and relativistic astrophysics\nRapidly varying astrophysical sources such as pulsars, accreting black holes, supernovae and — most recently — neutron-star-merger events, are the prime laboratories at our disposal to study physical processes, and to test general relativity in the strong field regime. Deepening our understanding of strong-field gravity and other fundamental physics via pulsars is a key science goal of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). We are at the forefront of all of the latest advances in transient science, including observations of the electromagnetic counterpart of the first neutron-star-merger event, GW170817, and radio detections of the first gamma-ray bursts detected with ground-based Cherenkov detectors. The Oxford pulsar group co-leads the design and development of the SKA instrumentation needed to deliver pulsar science, and has central involvement in the science exploitation of SKA pathfinder instruments such as LOFAR and MeerKAT. Global Jet Watch is a unique programme run by us to monitor stellar-mass accreting black holes in our Galaxy. The theory of the time evolution of relativistic accretion discs has been developed at Oxford and, in collaboration with the transient group, applied successfully to observations of tidal disruption events. Our outstanding plasma astrophysics programme makes state-of-the-art calculations which elucidate the dynamics of weakly collisional gas flows. This work is critical for understanding black hole accretion as well as the behaviour of the hot intracluster medium in clusters of galaxies.\nExoplanets\nExoplanets is one of the most rapidly developing fields of astrophysics and Oxford is one of the largest exoplanet research hubs in Europe. On the observational front, this work includes advanced statistical and machine-learning methods and precision radial-velocity measurements for exoplanet detection, and detailed atmospheric characterisation via innovative high resolution spectroscopy and high contrast imaging techniques. This in turn complements our instrumentation development of HARMONI and EPICS for the ELT. We are also leaders in advanced retrieval techniques for extracting atmospheric structure and composition from astronomical observations. Simulations have covered the range of planets from uninhabitable terrestrial planets such as lava planets, through habitable-zone terrestrial planets, and up through sub-Neptunes and hot and ultra-hot Jupiters and brown dwarfs. Pioneering work on long-term atmospheric evolution and habitability has been done at the interface of astrophysical, atmospheric and geochemistry disciplines.\nInstrumentation\nThe astrophysics instrumentation group is leading the design and development of key components of two global flagship ground-based astronomy projects: the ELT and the SKA. HARMONI will be the visible and near-infrared integral field spectrograph for the ELT, one of only two instruments that will be deployed at first light. We are now approaching the construction phase for the SKA, and are likely to be leading several work packages in this phase. Oxford also led the development of the innovative C-BASS project. In addition, in 2020 we completed the construction of the WEAVE spectrograph, which will be the main workhorse for the WHT for the next five years. The Astrophysics sub-department has also\ndeveloped expertise in the implementation of superconducting receiver technology for the direct detection of THz (sub-mm wavelength) radiation.\nContact\nProfessor Pedro Ferreira\nDenys Wilkinson Building\nKeble Road\nOxford\nOX1 3RH\nUK\n+44 (0) 1865 613973",

          "content": "Astrophysics\nAstrophysics is the study of how stars, planets, and other things in the Universe work, and how we can learn about them. Astrophysicists use physics and chemistry to explain what astronomers find and see.[1]\nAstrophysics is also the study of how the Universe started and how it is changing with time. This part of astrophysics is called cosmology.\nHistory\n[change | change source]For a long time, bodies in the sky seemed to be unchanging spheres moving in a circle. But on Earth, growth and decay happened, and natural motion was in a straight line. Therefore, people thought the celestial region was made of a fundamentally different kind of matter from that found on Earth.\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, natural philosophers such as Nicolaus Copernicus, Johannes Kepler, Galileo,[2] Descartes,[3] and Newton,[4] began to maintain that the celestial and terrestrial regions were made of similar material and were subject to the same natural laws.[5]\nWhen they were able to work out how the planets moved, the science of astrophysics was born. Sir Isaac Newton realized that the same rules of mechanics that he had found on the surface of the Earth also could be used to predict how the planets moved. He said, \"As above, so below\". By this, he meant that we can study how things work on this planet to find out how things work in space.\nLater scientists looked at the light from stars using spectroscopy. They were able to work out what they were made of, and how they changed with time.\nTypes of astrophysics\n[change | change source]There are two main types of astrophysics:\n- Observational astrophysics. Observational astrophysicists use telescopes to study the Universe, but astrophysicists study the physics of what they see to explain the Universe.\n- Radio astronomy\n- Optical astronomy\n- Infrared astronomy\n- Ultraviolet, X-ray, and gamma-ray astronomy using space telescopes\n- Theoretical astrophysics uses information from astronomers, theories, and mathematics to explain how the Universe works. Cosmology is a type of theoretical astrophysics. Problems investigated include:\n- Solar System: its formation and evolution\n- Star formation and evolution\n- Galaxy formation and evolution\n- large-scale structure of matter in the universe\n- Origin of cosmic rays\n- General relativity\n- Evolution of the universe\n- Hydrodynamics is used for mathematically modelling how gases behave. Strong magnetic fields found around many bodies can drastically change how these gases behave, affecting things from star formation to the flows of gases around compact stars.\nAn example\n[change | change source]Cecilia Helena Payne (later Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin) published her doctoral dissertation at Radcliffe College in 1925. She had discovered that hydrogen and helium were the main content of stars. More than that, the spectral classes relate to the temperature of stars. Despite Eddington's suggestion,[6] her discovery was so unexpected that her dissertation readers told her to modify the conclusion before publication. Later research confirmed her discovery.[7][8]\nRelated pages\n[change | change source]References\n[change | change source]- ↑ Keeler, James E. 1897.

          "content": "Astronomy & Astrophysics\nAstronomy & Astrophysics (A&A)[1] is a monthly peer-reviewed scientific journal covering theoretical, observational, and instrumental astronomy and astrophysics. It is operated by an editorial team under the supervision of a board of directors representing 27 sponsoring countries plus a representative of the European Southern Observatory. The journal is published by EDP Sciences and the current editors-in-chief are Thierry Forveille and João Alves.\nHistory\n[edit]Origins\n[edit]Astronomy & Astrophysics was created as an answer to the publishing situation found in Europe in the 1960s. At that time, multiple journals were being published in several countries around the continent. These journals usually had a limited number of subscribers, and articles were written in languages other than English. They were less widely read than American and British journals and the research they reported had therefore less impact in the community.[2]\nStarting in 1963, conversations between astronomers from European countries assessed the need for a common astronomical journal. On 8 April 1968, leading astronomers from Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Scandinavian countries met in Leiden University to prepare a possible merging of some of the principal existing journals. It was proposed that the new journal be called Astronomy and Astrophysics, A European Journal.[3]\nThe main policy-making body of the new journal was to be the \"Board of Directors\", consisting of senior astronomers or government representatives of the sponsoring countries. The board appoints the editors-in chief, who are responsible for the scientific contents of the journal. The European Southern Observatory was chosen as an additional body that acts on behalf of the board and handles the administrative, financial, and legal matters of the journal.\nA second meeting held in July 1968 in Brussels cemented the agreement discussed in Leiden. Each nation established an annual monetary contribution and appointed its delegates for the board of directors. Also at this meeting, the first editors-in-chief were appointed: Stuart Pottasch and Jean-Louis Steinberg.\nThe next meeting took place in Paris on 11 October 1968 and is officially regarded as the first meeting of the board of directors. At this meeting, the first chairman of the board, Adriaan Blaauw, was appointed, and the contract with the publisher Springer Science+Business Media was formalized.\nEarly years\n[edit]The first issue of A&A was published in January 1969, merging several national journals of individual European countries into one comprehensive publication.[2][3][4] These journals, with their ISSN and date of first publication, are as follows:\n- Annales d'Astrophysique ISSN 0365-0499 (France), established in 1938\n- Bulletin of the Astronomical Institutes of the Netherlands ISSN 0365-8910 (Netherlands), established in 1921\n- Bulletin Astronomique ISSN 0245-9787 (France), established in 1884\n- Journal des Observateurs ISSN 0368-3389 (France), established in 1915\n- Zeitschrift für Astrophysik ISSN 0372-8331 (Germany), established in 1930\nArkiv för Astronomi (ISSN 0004-2048), established in 1948 in Sweden, was also incorporated in 1973. The publishing of Astronomy & Astrophysics was further extended in 1992 by the incorporation of Bulletin of the Astronomical Institutes of Czechoslovakia (ISSN 0004-6248), established in 1947.\nThere were only four issues of the journal in 1969, but it soon became a monthly publication and one of the four major generalist astronomical journals in the world. Initially, papers were submitted in English, French or German, but it soon became clear that, for a given author, the papers in English were cited twice as often as those in other languages.\nIn addition to regular research papers in several different fields of astrophysics. A&A featured Letters and Research Notes for short manuscripts on a significant result or idea. A Supplement Series for the journal was created in 1970 for publishing extensive tabular material and catalogs.[citation needed]\n21st century\n[edit]The turn of the century brought important changes to the journal. In 2001, a new contract was signed with EDP Sciences, which replaced Springer as the publishing house. Special Issues featuring results of astronomical surveys and space missions such as XMM-Newton, Planck, Rosetta, and Gaia were introduced.\nThe editorial structure of the journal was profoundly changed in 2003 [5] and 2005 [6] to involve more countries in the editorial process and to better handle the increasing number of submissions. Precise criteria for publishing in Astronomy & Astrophysics were explicited in 2004.[7] English language editing was introduced in 2001 as a service to the diverse authorship of the journal.[8] An extensive survey of authors conducted in 2007 [9] showed widespread satisfaction with the new directions of the journal, although the use of structured abstracts [10] proved more controversial.\nThe evolution of electronic publishing resulted in the extinction of the Supplement Series, which was incorporated in the main journal in 2001, and of the printed edition in 2016. [11] The Research Notes section was also discontinued in 2016.[12]\nIn 2023, A&A announced the introduction of links between articles and corresponding ESO datasets.\nThe journal editorial office is located at the Paris Observatory and is supervised by the managing editor. It handles over 2000 papers per year.\nAn archive of the published articles and related material is maintained by the Centre de données astronomiques de Strasbourg.\nSponsoring countries\n[edit]The original sponsoring countries were the four countries whose journals merged to form Astronomy & Astrophysics (France, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden), together with Belgium, Denmark, Finland, and Norway. Norway later withdrew, but Austria, Greece, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland joined during the 1970s and 1980s. The Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia all joined as new members in the 1990s.\nIn 2001 the words \"A European Journal\" were removed from the front cover in recognition of the fact that the journal was becoming increasingly global in scope. In effect, Argentina was admitted as an \"observer\" in 2002. In 2004 the board of directors decided that the journal \"will henceforth consider applications for sponsoring membership from any country in the world with well-documented active and excellent astronomical research\".[13] Argentina became the first non-European country to gain full membership in 2005, followed by Brazil and Chile in 2006 (Brazil withdrew in 2016). Other European countries also joined during the 21st century: Portugal, Croatia, and Bulgaria during the 2010s, and Armenia, Lithuania, Norway, Serbia and Ukraine in the 2010s. The current list of member countries is listed here.[14]\nChairs of the Board of Directors\n[edit]The following persons are or have been chairs of the Board of Directors:\n- 2023 - : A.

Authors had the option to pay article processing charges (APC) for immediate and permanent open access. Furthermore, all Letters to the Editor and all articles published in Sections 12 to 15 were in free access at no cost to the authors. Articles in the other sections of the journal were made freely available 12 months after publication (delayed open-access), through the publisher's site and via the Astrophysics Data System.\nSince the beginning of 2022, Astronomy & Astrophysics is published in full open access under the Subscribe to Open (S2O) model.\nScientific Writing School\n[edit]A&A organises Scientific Writing Schools[15] aimed at postgraduate students and young researchers. The purpose of these schools is to teach young authors how to express their scientific results through adequate and efficient science writing. As of 2025, six of these schools were organised in Belgium (2008 and 2009), Hungary (2014), Chile (2016), China (2019), and Portugal (2025).\nAbstracting and indexing\n[edit]This journal is abstracted and indexed in:\nAccording to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2022 impact factor of 6.5.[23]\nSee also\n[edit]- The Astronomical Journal\n- The Astrophysical Journal\n- Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ Referred to as A&A on its own website\n- ^ a b Meynet, Georges (2006), Heck, André (ed.), \"Astronomy & Astrophysics - A Journal of Astronomers for Astronomers\", Organizations and Strategies in Astronomy, Astrophysics and Space Science Library, vol. 7, Dordrecht: Springer Netherlands, pp. 273–283, doi:10.1007/978-1-4020-5301-6_15, ISBN 978-1-4020-5301-6, archived from the original on 19 August 2023, retrieved 29 April 2023\n- ^ a b Pottasch, S.

          "content": "Nuclear astrophysics\nNuclear astrophysics studies the origin of the chemical elements and isotopes, and the role of nuclear energy generation, in cosmic sources such as stars, supernovae, novae, and violent binary-star interactions. It is an interdisciplinary part of both nuclear physics and astrophysics, involving close collaboration among researchers in various subfields of each of these fields. This includes, notably, nuclear reactions and their rates as they occur in cosmic environments, and modeling of astrophysical objects where these nuclear reactions may occur, but also considerations of cosmic evolution of isotopic and elemental composition (often called chemical evolution). Constraints from observations involve multiple messengers, all across the electromagnetic spectrum (nuclear gamma-rays, X-rays, optical, and radio/sub-mm astronomy), as well as isotopic measurements of solar-system materials such as meteorites and their stardust inclusions, cosmic rays, material deposits on Earth and Moon). Nuclear physics experiments address stability (i.e., lifetimes and masses) for atomic nuclei well beyond the regime of stable nuclides into the realm of radioactive/unstable nuclei, almost to the limits of bound nuclei (the drip lines), and under high density (up to neutron star matter) and high temperature (plasma temperatures up to 109 K). Theories and simulations are essential parts herein, as cosmic nuclear reaction environments cannot be realized, but at best partially approximated by experiments.\nHistory\n[edit]In the 1940s, geologist Hans Suess speculated that the regularity that was observed in the abundances of elements may be related to structural properties of the atomic nucleus.[1] These considerations were seeded by the discovery of radioactivity by Becquerel in 1896[2] as an aside of advances in chemistry which aimed at production of gold. This remarkable possibility for transformation of matter created much excitement among physicists for the next decades, culminating in discovery of the atomic nucleus, with milestones in Ernest Rutherford's scattering experiments in 1911, and the discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick (1932). After Aston demonstrated that the mass of helium is less than four times that of the proton, Eddington proposed that, through an unknown process in the Sun's core, hydrogen is transmuted into helium, liberating energy.[3] Twenty years later, Bethe and von Weizsäcker independently derived the CN cycle,[4][5] the first known nuclear reaction that accomplishes this transmutation. The interval between Eddington's proposal and derivation of the CN cycle can mainly be attributed to an incomplete understanding of nuclear structure. The basic principles for explaining the origin of elements and energy generation in stars appear in the concepts describing nucleosynthesis, which arose in the 1940s, led by George Gamow and presented in a 2-page paper in 1948 as the Alpher–Bethe–Gamow paper. A complete concept of processes that make up cosmic nucleosynthesis was presented in the late 1950s by Burbidge, Burbidge, Fowler, and Hoyle,[6] and by Cameron.[7] Fowler is largely credited with initiating collaboration between astronomers, astrophysicists, and theoretical and experimental nuclear physicists, in a field that we now know as nuclear astrophysics[8] (for which he won the 1983 Nobel Prize). During these same decades, Arthur Eddington and others were able to link the liberation of nuclear binding energy through such nuclear reactions to the structural equations of stars.[9]\nThese developments were not without curious deviations. Many notable physicists of the 19th century such as Mayer, Waterson, von Helmholtz, and Lord Kelvin, postulated that the Sun radiates thermal energy by converting gravitational potential energy into heat. Its lifetime as calculated from this assumption using the virial theorem, around 19 million years, was found inconsistent with the interpretation of geological records and the (then new) theory of biological evolution. Alternatively, if the Sun consisted entirely of a fossil fuel like coal, considering the rate of its thermal energy emission, its lifetime would be merely four or five thousand years, clearly inconsistent with records of human civilization.\nBasic concepts\n[edit]During cosmic times, nuclear reactions re-arrange the nucleons that were left behind from the big bang (in the form of isotopes of hydrogen and helium, and traces of lithium, beryllium, and boron) to other isotopes and elements as we find them today (see graph). The driver is a conversion of nuclear binding energy to exothermic energy, favoring nuclei with more binding of their nucleons - these are then lighter as their original components by the binding energy. The most tightly-bound nucleus from symmetric matter of neutrons and protons is 56Ni. The release of nuclear binding energy is what allows stars to shine for up to billions of years, and may disrupt stars in stellar explosions in case of violent reactions (such as 12C+12C fusion for thermonuclear supernova explosions). As matter is processed as such within stars and stellar explosions, some of the products are ejected from the nuclear-reaction site and end up in interstellar gas. Then, it may form new stars, and be processed further through nuclear reactions, in a cycle of matter. This results in compositional evolution of cosmic gas in and between stars and galaxies, enriching such gas with heavier elements. Nuclear astrophysics is the science to describe and understand the nuclear and astrophysical processes within such cosmic and galactic chemical evolution, linking it to knowledge from nuclear physics and astrophysics. Measurements are used to test our understanding: Astronomical constraints are obtained from stellar and interstellar abundance data of elements and isotopes, and other multi-messenger astronomical measurements of the cosmic object phenomena help to understand and model these. Nuclear properties can be obtained from terrestrial nuclear laboratories such as accelerators with their experiments. Theory and simulations are needed to understand and complement such data, providing models for nuclear reaction rates under the variety of cosmic conditions, and for the structure and dynamics of cosmic objects.\nFindings, current status, and issues\n[edit]Nuclear astrophysics remains as a complex puzzle to science.[10] The current consensus on the origins of elements and isotopes are that only hydrogen and helium (and traces of lithium) can be formed in a homogeneous Big Bang (see Big Bang nucleosynthesis), while all other elements and their isotopes are formed in cosmic objects that formed later, such as in stars and their explosions.[11]\nThe Sun's primary energy source is hydrogen fusion to helium at about 15 million degrees. The proton–proton chain reactions dominate, they occur at much lower energies although much more slowly than catalytic hydrogen fusion through CNO cycle reactions. Nuclear astrophysics gives a picture of the Sun's energy source producing a lifetime consistent with the age of the Solar System derived from meteoritic abundances of lead and uranium isotopes – an age of about 4.5 billion years. The core hydrogen burning of stars, as it now occurs in the Sun, defines the main sequence of stars, illustrated in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram that classifies stages of stellar evolution. The Sun's lifetime of H burning via pp-chains is about 9 billion years. This primarily is determined by extremely slow production of deuterium,\nwhich is governed by the weak interaction.\nWork that led to discovery of neutrino oscillation (implying a non-zero mass for the neutrino absent in the Standard Model of particle physics) was motivated by a solar neutrino flux about three times lower than expected from theories — a long-standing concern in the nuclear astrophysics community colloquially known as the Solar neutrino problem.\nThe concepts of nuclear astrophysics are supported by observation of the element technetium (the lightest chemical element without stable isotopes) in stars,[12] by galactic gamma-ray line emitters (such as 26Al,[13] 60Fe, and 44Ti[14]), by radioactive-decay gamma-ray lines from the 56Ni decay chain observed from two supernovae (SN1987A and SN2014J) coincident with optical supernova light, and by observation of neutrinos from the Sun[15] and from supernova 1987a. These observations have far-reaching implications. 26Al has a lifetime of a million years, which is very short on a galactic timescale, proving that nucleosynthesis is an ongoing process within our Milky Way Galaxy in the current epoch.\nCurrent descriptions of the cosmic evolution of elemental abundances are broadly consistent with those observed in the Solar System and galaxy.[11]\nThe roles of specific cosmic objects in producing these elemental abundances are clear for some elements, and heavily debated for others. For example, iron is believed to originate mostly from thermonuclear supernova explosions (also called supernovae of type Ia), and carbon and oxygen is believed to originate mostly from massive stars and their explosions. Lithium, beryllium, and boron are believed to originate from spallation reactions of cosmic-ray nuclei such as carbon and heavier nuclei, breaking these apart.[11] Elements heavier than nickel are produced via the slow and rapid neutron capture processes, each contributing roughly half the abundance of these elements.[16] The s-process is believed to occur in the envelopes of dying stars, whereas some uncertainty exists regarding r-process sites. The r-process is believed to occur in supernova explosions and compact object mergers, though observational evidence is limited to a single event, GW170817, and relative yields of proposed r-process sites leading to observed heavy element abundances are uncertain.[11][16][17]\nThe transport of nuclear reaction products from their sources through the interstellar and intergalactic medium also is unclear. Additionally, many nuclei that are involved in cosmic nuclear reactions are unstable and may only exist temporarily in cosmic sites, and their properties (e.g., binding energy) cannot be investigated in the laboratory due to difficulties in their synthesis. Similarly, stellar structure and its dynamics is not satisfactorily described in models and hard to observe except through asteroseismology, and supernova explosion models lack a consistent description based on physical processes, and include heuristic elements. Current research extensively utilizes computation and numerical modeling.[18]\nFuture work\n[edit]Although the foundations of nuclear astrophysics appear clear and plausible, many puzzles remain. These include understanding helium fusion (specifically the 12C(α,γ)16O reaction(s)),[19] astrophysical sites of the r-process,[16] anomalous lithium abundances in population II stars,[20] the explosion mechanism in core-collapse supernovae,[18] and progenitors of thermonuclear supernovae.[21]\nSee also\n[edit]- Nuclear physics\n- Astrophysics\n- Nucleosynthesis\n- Abundance of the chemical elements\n- Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ Suess, Hans E.; Urey, Harold C.

          "content": "Botany\nBotany, also called plant science, is the branch of natural science and biology studying plants, especially their anatomy, taxonomy, and ecology.[1] A botanist or plant scientist is a scientist who specialises in this field. \"Plant\" and \"botany\" may be defined more narrowly to include only land plants and their study, which is also known as phytology. Phytologists or botanists (in the strict sense) study approximately 410,000 species of land plants, including some 391,000 species of vascular plants (of which approximately 369,000 are flowering plants)[2] and approximately 20,000 bryophytes.[3]\nBotany originated in prehistory as herbalism with the efforts of early humans to identify – and later cultivate – plants that were edible, poisonous, and possibly medicinal, making it one of the first endeavours of human investigation. Medieval physic gardens, often attached to monasteries, contained plants possibly having medicinal benefit. They were forerunners of the first botanical gardens attached to universities, founded from the 1540s onwards. One of the earliest was the Padua botanical garden. These gardens facilitated the academic study of plants. Efforts to catalogue and describe their collections were the beginnings of plant taxonomy and led in 1753 to the binomial system of nomenclature of Carl Linnaeus that remains in use to this day for the naming of all biological species.\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, new techniques were developed for the study of plants, including methods of optical microscopy and live cell imaging, electron microscopy, analysis of chromosome number, plant chemistry and the structure and function of enzymes and other proteins. In the last two decades of the 20th century, botanists exploited the techniques of molecular genetic analysis, including genomics and proteomics and DNA sequences to classify plants more accurately.\nModern botany is a broad subject with contributions and insights from most other areas of science and technology. Research topics include the study of plant structure, growth and differentiation, reproduction, biochemistry and primary metabolism, chemical products, development, diseases, evolutionary relationships, systematics, and plant taxonomy. Dominant themes in 21st-century plant science are molecular genetics and epigenetics, which study the mechanisms and control of gene expression during differentiation of plant cells and tissues. Botanical research has diverse applications in providing staple foods, materials such as timber, oil, rubber, fibre and drugs, in modern horticulture, agriculture and forestry, plant propagation, breeding and genetic modification, in the synthesis of chemicals and raw materials for construction and energy production, in environmental management, and the maintenance of biodiversity.\nEtymology\n[edit]The term \"botany\" comes from the Ancient Greek word botanē (βοτάνη) meaning \"pasture\", \"herbs\" \"grass\", or \"fodder\";[4] Botanē is in turn derived from boskein (Greek: βόσκειν), \"to feed\" or \"to graze\".[5][6][7] Traditionally, botany has also included the study of fungi and algae by mycologists and phycologists respectively, with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the sphere of interest of the International Botanical Congress.\nHistory\n[edit]Early botany\n[edit]Botany originated as herbalism, the study and use of plants for their possible medicinal properties.[8] The early recorded history of botany includes many ancient writings and plant classifications. Examples of early botanical works have been found in ancient texts from India dating back to before 1100 BCE,[9][10] Ancient Egypt,[11] in archaic Avestan writings, and in works from China purportedly from before 221 BCE.[9][12]\nModern botany traces its roots back to Ancient Greece specifically to Theophrastus (c. 371–287 BCE), a student of Aristotle who invented and described many of its principles and is widely regarded in the scientific community as the \"Father of Botany\".[13] His major works, Enquiry into Plants and On the Causes of Plants, constitute the most important contributions to botanical science until the Middle Ages, almost seventeen centuries later.[13][14]\nAnother work from Ancient Greece that made an early impact on botany is De materia medica, a five-volume encyclopedia about preliminary herbal medicine written in the middle of the first century by Greek physician and pharmacologist Pedanius Dioscorides. De materia medica was widely read for more than 1,500 years.[15] Important contributions from the medieval Muslim world include Ibn Wahshiyya's Nabatean Agriculture, Abū Ḥanīfa Dīnawarī's (828–896) the Book of Plants, and Ibn Bassal's The Classification of Soils. In the early 13th century, Abu al-Abbas al-Nabati, and Ibn al-Baitar (d. 1248) wrote on botany in a systematic and scientific manner.[16][17][18]\nIn the mid-16th century, botanical gardens were founded in a number of Italian universities. The Padua botanical garden in 1545 is usually considered to be the first which is still in its original location. These gardens continued the practical value of earlier \"physic gardens\", often associated with monasteries, in which plants were cultivated for suspected medicinal uses. They supported the growth of botany as an academic subject. Lectures were given about the plants grown in the gardens. Botanical gardens came much later to northern Europe; the first in England was the University of Oxford Botanic Garden in 1621.[19]\nGerman physician Leonhart Fuchs (1501–1566) was one of \"the three German fathers of botany\", along with theologian Otto Brunfels (1489–1534) and physician Hieronymus Bock (1498–1554) (also called Hieronymus Tragus).[20][21] Fuchs and Brunfels broke away from the tradition of copying earlier works to make original observations of their own. Bock created his own system of plant classification.\nPhysician Valerius Cordus (1515–1544) authored a botanically and pharmacologically important herbal Historia Plantarum in 1544 and a pharmacopoeia of lasting importance, the Dispensatorium in 1546.[22] Naturalist Conrad von Gesner (1516–1565) and herbalist John Gerard (1545 – c. 1611) published herbals covering the supposed medicinal uses of plants. Naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi (1522–1605) was considered the father of natural history, which included the study of plants. In 1665, using an early microscope, Polymath Robert Hooke discovered cells (a term he coined) in cork, and a short time later in living plant tissue.[23]\nEarly modern botany\n[edit]During the 18th century, systems of plant identification were developed comparable to dichotomous keys, where unidentified plants are placed into taxonomic groups (e.g. family, genus and species) by making a series of choices between pairs of characters. The choice and sequence of the characters may be artificial in keys designed purely for identification (diagnostic keys) or more closely related to the natural or phyletic order of the taxa in synoptic keys.[24] By the 18th century, new plants for study were arriving in Europe in increasing numbers from newly discovered countries and the European colonies worldwide. In 1753, Carl Linnaeus published his Species Plantarum, a hierarchical classification of plant species that remains the reference point for modern botanical nomenclature. This established a standardised binomial or two-part naming scheme where the first name represented the genus and the second identified the species within the genus.[25] For the purposes of identification, Linnaeus's Systema Sexuale classified plants into 24 groups according to the number of their male sexual organs. The 24th group, Cryptogamia, included all plants with concealed reproductive parts, mosses, liverworts, ferns, algae and fungi.[26]\nIncreasing knowledge of plant anatomy, morphology and life cycles led to the realisation that there were more natural affinities between plants than the artificial sexual system of Linnaeus. Adanson (1763), de Jussieu (1789), and Candolle (1819) all proposed various alternative natural systems of classification that grouped plants using a wider range of shared characters and were widely followed. The Candollean system reflected his ideas of the progression of morphological complexity and the later Bentham & Hooker system, which was influential until the mid-19th century, was influenced by Candolle's approach. Darwin's publication of the Origin of Species in 1859 and his concept of common descent required modifications to the Candollean system to reflect evolutionary relationships as distinct from mere morphological similarity.[27]\nIn the 19th century botany was a socially acceptable hobby for upper-class women. These women would collect and paint flowers and plants from around the world with scientific accuracy. The paintings were used to record many species that could not be transported or maintained in other environments. Marianne North illustrated over 900 species in extreme detail with watercolor and oil paintings.[28] Her work and many other women's botany work was the beginning of popularizing botany to a wider audience.\nBotany was greatly stimulated by the appearance of the first \"modern\" textbook, Matthias Schleiden's Grundzüge der Wissenschaftlichen Botanik, published in English in 1849 as Principles of Scientific Botany.[29] Schleiden was a microscopist and an early plant anatomist who co-founded the cell theory with Theodor Schwann and Rudolf Virchow and was among the first to grasp the significance of the cell nucleus that had been described by Robert Brown in 1831.[30] In 1855, Adolf Fick formulated Fick's laws that enabled the calculation of the rates of molecular diffusion in biological systems.[31]\nLate modern botany\n[edit]Building upon the gene-chromosome theory of heredity that originated with Gregor Mendel (1822–1884), August Weismann (1834–1914) proved that inheritance only takes place through gametes. No other cells can pass on inherited characters.[32] The work of Katherine Esau (1898–1997) on plant anatomy is still a major foundation of modern botany. Her books Plant Anatomy and Anatomy of Seed Plants have been key plant structural biology texts for more than half a century.[33][34]\nThe discipline of plant ecology was pioneered in the late 19th century by botanists such as Eugenius Warming, who produced the hypothesis that plants form communities, and his mentor and successor Christen C. Raunkiær whose system for describing plant life forms is still in use today. The concept that the composition of plant communities such as temperate broadleaf forest changes by a process of ecological succession was developed by Henry Chandler Cowles, Arthur Tansley and Frederic Clements. Clements is credited with the idea of climax vegetation as the most complex vegetation that an environment can support and Tansley introduced the concept of ecosystems to biology.[35][36][37] Building on the extensive earlier work of Alphonse de Candolle, Nikolai Vavilov (1887–1943) produced accounts of the biogeography, centres of origin, and evolutionary history of economic plants.[38]\nParticularly since the mid-1960s there have been advances in understanding of the physics of plant physiological processes such as transpiration (the transport of water within plant tissues), the temperature dependence of rates of water evaporation from the leaf surface and the molecular diffusion of water vapour and carbon dioxide through stomatal apertures. These developments, coupled with new methods for measuring the size of stomatal apertures, and the rate of photosynthesis have enabled precise description of the rates of gas exchange between plants and the atmosphere.[39][40] Innovations in statistical analysis by Ronald Fisher,[41] Frank Yates and others at Rothamsted Experimental Station facilitated rational experimental design and data analysis in botanical research.[42] The discovery and identification of the auxin plant hormones by Kenneth V. Thimann in 1948 enabled regulation of plant growth by externally applied chemicals. Frederick Campion Steward pioneered techniques of micropropagation and plant tissue culture controlled by plant hormones.[43] The synthetic auxin 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid or 2,4-D was one of the first commercial synthetic herbicides.[44]\n20th century developments in plant biochemistry have been driven by modern techniques of organic chemical analysis, such as spectroscopy, chromatography and electrophoresis. With the rise of the related molecular-scale biological approaches of molecular biology, genomics, proteomics and metabolomics, the relationship between the plant genome and most aspects of the biochemistry, physiology, morphology and behaviour of plants can be subjected to detailed experimental analysis.[45] The concept originally stated by Gottlieb Haberlandt in 1902[46] that all plant cells are totipotent and can be grown in vitro ultimately enabled the use of genetic engineering experimentally to knock out a gene or genes responsible for a specific trait, or to add genes such as GFP that report when a gene of interest is being expressed. These technologies enable the biotechnological use of whole plants or plant cell cultures grown in bioreactors to synthesise pesticides, antibiotics or other pharmaceuticals, as well as the practical application of genetically modified crops designed for traits such as improved yield.[47]\nModern morphology recognises a continuum between the major morphological categories of root, stem (caulome), leaf (phyllome) and trichome.[48] Furthermore, it emphasises structural dynamics.[49] Modern systematics aims to reflect and discover phylogenetic relationships between plants.[50][51][52][53] Modern molecular phylogenetics largely ignores morphological characters, relying on DNA sequences as data. Molecular analysis of DNA sequences from most families of flowering plants enabled the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group to publish in 1998 a phylogeny of flowering plants, answering many of the questions about relationships among angiosperm families and species.[54] The theoretical possibility of a practical method for identification of plant species and commercial varieties by DNA barcoding is the subject of active current research.[55][56]\nBranches of botany\n[edit]Botany is divided along several axes.\nSome subfields of botany relate to particular groups of organisms. Divisions related to the broader historical sense of botany include bacteriology, mycology (or fungology), and phycology – respectively, the study of bacteria, fungi, and algae – with lichenology as a subfield of mycology. The narrower sense of botany as the study of embryophytes (land plants) is called phytology. Bryology is the study of mosses (and in the broader sense also liverworts and hornworts). Pteridology (or filicology) is the study of ferns and allied plants. A number of other taxa of ranks varying from family to subgenus have terms for their study, including agrostology (or graminology) for the study of grasses, synantherology for the study of composites, and batology for the study of brambles.\nStudy can also be divided by guild rather than clade or grade. For example, dendrology is the study of woody plants.\nMany divisions of biology have botanical subfields. These are commonly denoted by prefixing the word plant (e.g. plant taxonomy, plant ecology, plant anatomy, plant morphology, plant systematics), or prefixing or substituting the prefix phyto- (e.g. phytochemistry, phytogeography). The study of fossil plants is called palaeobotany. Other fields are denoted by adding or substituting the word botany (e.g. systematic botany).\nPhytosociology is a subfield of plant ecology that classifies and studies communities of plants.\nThe intersection of fields from the above pair of categories gives rise to fields such as bryogeography, the study of the distribution of mosses.\nDifferent parts of plants also give rise to their own subfields, including xylology, carpology (or fructology), and palynology, these being the study of wood, fruit and pollen/spores respectively.\nBotany also overlaps on the one hand with agriculture, horticulture and silviculture, and on the other hand with medicine and pharmacology, giving rise to fields such as agronomy, horticultural botany, phytopathology, and phytopharmacology.\nScope and importance\n[edit]The study of plants is vital because they underpin almost all animal life on Earth by generating a large proportion of the oxygen and food that provide humans and other organisms with aerobic respiration with the chemical energy they need to exist. Plants, algae and cyanobacteria are the major groups of organisms that carry out photosynthesis, a process that uses the energy of sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide[57] into sugars that can be used both as a source of chemical energy and of organic molecules that are used in the structural components of cells.[58] As a by-product of photosynthesis, plants release oxygen into the atmosphere, a gas that is required by nearly all living things to carry out cellular respiration. In addition, they are influential in the global carbon and water cycles and plant roots bind and stabilise soils, preventing soil erosion.[59] Plants are crucial to the future of human society as they provide food, oxygen, biochemicals, and products for people, as well as creating and preserving soil.[60]\nHistorically, all living things were classified as either animals or plants[61] and botany covered the study of all organisms not considered animals.[62] Botanists examine both the internal functions and processes within plant organelles, cells, tissues, whole plants, plant populations and plant communities. At each of these levels, a botanist may be concerned with the classification (taxonomy), phylogeny and evolution, structure (anatomy and morphology), or function (physiology) of plant life.[63]\nThe strictest definition of \"plant\" includes only the \"land plants\" or embryophytes, which include seed plants (gymnosperms, including the pines, and flowering plants) and the free-sporing cryptogams including ferns, clubmosses, liverworts, hornworts and mosses. Embryophytes are multicellular eukaryotes descended from an ancestor that obtained its energy from sunlight by photosynthesis. They have life cycles with alternating haploid and diploid phases. The sexual haploid phase of embryophytes, known as the gametophyte, nurtures the developing diploid embryo sporophyte within its tissues for at least part of its life,[64] even in the seed plants, where the gametophyte itself is nurtured by its parent sporophyte.[65] Other groups of organisms that were previously studied by botanists include bacteria (now studied in bacteriology), fungi (mycology) – including lichen-forming fungi (lichenology), non-chlorophyte algae (phycology), and viruses (virology). However, attention is still given to these groups by botanists, and fungi (including lichens) and photosynthetic protists are usually covered in introductory botany courses.[66][67]\nPalaeobotanists study ancient plants in the fossil record to provide information about the evolutionary history of plants. Cyanobacteria, the first oxygen-releasing photosynthetic organisms on Earth, are thought to have given rise to the ancestor of plants by entering into an endosymbiotic relationship with an early eukaryote, ultimately becoming the chloroplasts in plant cells. The new photosynthetic plants (along with their algal relatives) accelerated the rise in atmospheric oxygen started by the cyanobacteria, changing the ancient oxygen-free, reducing, atmosphere to one in which free oxygen has been abundant for more than 2 billion years.[68][69]\nAmong the important botanical questions of the 21st century are the role of plants as primary producers in the global cycling of life's basic ingredients: energy, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and water, and ways that our plant stewardship can help address the global environmental issues of resource management, conservation, human food security, biologically invasive organisms, carbon sequestration, climate change, and sustainability.[70]\nHuman nutrition\n[edit]Virtually all staple foods come either directly from primary production by plants, or indirectly from animals that eat them.[71] Plants and other photosynthetic organisms are at the base of most food chains because they use the energy from the sun and nutrients from the soil and atmosphere, converting them into a form that can be used by animals. This is what ecologists call the first trophic level.[72] The modern forms of the major staple foods, such as hemp, teff, maize, rice, wheat and other cereal grasses, pulses, bananas and plantains,[73] as well as hemp, flax and cotton grown for their fibres, are the outcome of prehistoric selection over thousands of years from among wild ancestral plants with the most desirable characteristics.[74]\nBotanists study how plants produce food and how to increase yields, for example through plant breeding, making their work important to humanity's ability to feed the world and provide food security for future generations.[75] Botanists also study weeds, which are a considerable problem in agriculture, and the biology and control of plant pathogens in agriculture and natural ecosystems.[76] Ethnobotany is the study of the relationships between plants and people. When applied to the investigation of historical plant–people relationships ethnobotany may be referred to as archaeobotany or palaeoethnobotany.[77] Some of the earliest plant-people relationships arose between the indigenous people of Canada in identifying edible plants from inedible plants. This relationship the indigenous people had with plants was recorded by ethnobotanists.[78]\nPlant biochemistry\n[edit]Plant biochemistry is the study of the chemical processes used by plants. Some of these processes are used in their primary metabolism like the photosynthetic Calvin cycle and crassulacean acid metabolism.[79] Others make specialised materials like the cellulose and lignin used to build their bodies, and secondary products like resins and aroma compounds.\nPlants and various other groups of photosynthetic eukaryotes collectively known as \"algae\" have unique organelles known as chloroplasts. Chloroplasts are thought to be descended from cyanobacteria that formed endosymbiotic relationships with ancient plant and algal ancestors. Chloroplasts and cyanobacteria contain the blue-green pigment chlorophyll a.[80] Chlorophyll a (as well as its plant and green algal-specific cousin chlorophyll b)[a] absorbs light in the blue-violet and orange/red parts of the spectrum while reflecting and transmitting the green light that we see as the characteristic colour of these organisms. The energy in the red and blue light that these pigments absorb is used by chloroplasts to make energy-rich carbon compounds from carbon dioxide and water by oxygenic photosynthesis, a process that generates molecular oxygen (O2) as a by-product.\nThe light energy captured by chlorophyll a is initially in the form of electrons (and later a proton gradient) that is used to make molecules of ATP and NADPH which temporarily store and transport energy. Their energy is used in the light-independent reactions of the Calvin cycle by the enzyme rubisco to produce molecules of the 3-carbon sugar glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is the first product of photosynthesis and the raw material from which glucose and almost all other organic molecules of biological origin are synthesised. Some of the glucose is converted to starch which is stored in the chloroplast.[84] Starch is the characteristic energy store of most land plants and algae, while inulin, a polymer of fructose is used for the same purpose in the sunflower family Asteraceae. Some of the glucose is converted to sucrose (common table sugar) for export to the rest of the plant.\nUnlike in animals (which lack chloroplasts), plants and their eukaryote relatives have delegated many biochemical roles to their chloroplasts, including synthesising all their fatty acids,[85][86] and most amino acids.[87] The fatty acids that chloroplasts make are used for many things, such as providing material to build cell membranes out of and making the polymer cutin which is found in the plant cuticle that protects land plants from drying out.[88]\nPlants synthesise a number of unique polymers like the polysaccharide molecules cellulose, pectin and xyloglucan[89] from which the land plant cell wall is constructed.[90] Vascular land plants make lignin, a polymer used to strengthen the secondary cell walls of xylem tracheids and vessels to keep them from collapsing when a plant sucks water through them under water stress. Lignin is also used in other cell types like sclerenchyma fibres that provide structural support for a plant and is a major constituent of wood. Sporopollenin is a chemically resistant polymer found in the outer cell walls of spores and pollen of land plants responsible for the survival of early land plant spores and the pollen of seed plants in the fossil record. It is widely regarded as a marker for the start of land plant evolution during the Ordovician period.[91] The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today is much lower than it was when plants emerged onto land during the Ordovician and Silurian periods. Many monocots like maize and the pineapple and some dicots like the Asteraceae have since independently evolved[92] pathways like Crassulacean acid metabolism and the C4 carbon fixation pathway for photosynthesis which avoid the losses resulting from photorespiration in the more common C3 carbon fixation pathway. These biochemical strategies are unique to land plants.\nMedicine and materials\n[edit]Phytochemistry is a branch of plant biochemistry primarily concerned with the chemical substances produced by plants during secondary metabolism.[93] Some of these compounds are toxins such as the alkaloid coniine from hemlock. Others, such as the essential oils peppermint oil and lemon oil are useful for their aroma, as flavourings and spices (e.g., capsaicin), and in medicine as pharmaceuticals as in opium from opium poppies. Many medicinal and recreational drugs, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (active ingredient in cannabis), caffeine, morphine and nicotine come directly from plants. Others are simple derivatives of botanical natural products. For example, the pain killer aspirin is the acetyl ester of salicylic acid, originally isolated from the bark of willow trees,[94] and a wide range of opiate painkillers like heroin are obtained by chemical modification of morphine obtained from the opium poppy.[95] Popular stimulants come from plants, such as caffeine from coffee, tea and chocolate, and nicotine from tobacco. Most alcoholic beverages come from fermentation of carbohydrate-rich plant products such as barley (beer), rice (sake) and grapes (wine).[96] Native Americans have used various plants as ways of treating illness or disease for thousands of years.[97] This knowledge Native Americans have on plants has been recorded by enthnobotanists and then in turn has been used by pharmaceutical companies as a way of drug discovery.[98]\nPlants can synthesise coloured dyes and pigments such as the anthocyanins responsible for the red colour of red wine, yellow weld and blue woad used together to produce Lincoln green, indoxyl, source of the blue dye indigo traditionally used to dye denim and the artist's pigments gamboge and rose madder.\nSugar, starch, cotton, linen, hemp, some types of rope, wood and particle boards, papyrus and paper, vegetable oils, wax, and natural rubber are examples of commercially important materials made from plant tissues or their secondary products. Charcoal, a pure form of carbon made by pyrolysis of wood, has a long history as a metal-smelting fuel, as a filter material and adsorbent and as an artist's material and is one of the three ingredients of gunpowder. Cellulose, the world's most abundant organic polymer,[99] can be converted into energy, fuels, materials and chemical feedstock. Products made from cellulose include rayon and cellophane, wallpaper paste, biobutanol and gun cotton. Sugarcane, rapeseed and soy are some of the plants with a highly fermentable sugar or oil content that are used as sources of biofuels, important alternatives to fossil fuels, such as biodiesel.[100] Sweetgrass was used by Native Americans to ward off bugs like mosquitoes.[101] These bug repelling properties of sweetgrass were later found by the American Chemical Society in the molecules phytol and coumarin.[101]\nPlant ecology\n[edit]Plant ecology is the science of the functional relationships between plants and their habitats – the environments where they complete their life cycles. Plant ecologists study the composition of local and regional floras, their biodiversity, genetic diversity and fitness, the adaptation of plants to their environment, and their competitive or mutualistic interactions with other species.[103] Some ecologists even rely on empirical data from indigenous people that is gathered by ethnobotanists.[104] This information can relay a great deal of information on how the land once was thousands of years ago and how it has changed over that time.[104] The goals of plant ecology are to understand the causes of their distribution patterns, productivity, environmental impact, evolution, and responses to environmental change.[105]\nPlants depend on certain edaphic (soil) and climatic factors in their environment but can modify these factors too. For example, they can change their environment's albedo, increase runoff interception, stabilise mineral soils and develop their organic content, and affect local temperature. Plants compete with other organisms in their ecosystem for resources.[106][107] They interact with their neighbours at a variety of spatial scales in groups, populations and communities that collectively constitute vegetation. Regions with characteristic vegetation types and dominant plants as well as similar abiotic and biotic factors, climate, and geography make up biomes like tundra or tropical rainforest.[108]\nHerbivores eat plants, but plants can defend themselves and some species are parasitic or even carnivorous. Other organisms form mutually beneficial relationships with plants. For example, mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobia provide plants with nutrients in exchange for food, ants are recruited by ant plants to provide protection,[109] honey bees, bats and other animals pollinate flowers[110][111] and humans and other animals[112] act as dispersal vectors to spread spores and seeds.\nPlants, climate and environmental change\n[edit]Plant responses to climate and other environmental changes can inform our understanding of how these changes affect ecosystem function and productivity. For example, plant phenology can be a useful proxy for temperature in historical climatology, and the biological impact of climate change and global warming. Palynology, the analysis of fossil pollen deposits in sediments from thousands or millions of years ago allows the reconstruction of past climates.[113] Estimates of atmospheric CO2 concentrations since the Palaeozoic have been obtained from stomatal densities and the leaf shapes and sizes of ancient land plants.[114] Ozone depletion can expose plants to higher levels of ultraviolet radiation-B (UV-B), resulting in lower growth rates.[115] Moreover, information from studies of community ecology, plant systematics, and taxonomy is essential to understanding vegetation change, habitat destruction and species extinction.[116]\nGenetics\n[edit]Inheritance in plants follows the same fundamental principles of genetics as in other multicellular organisms. Gregor Mendel discovered the genetic laws of inheritance by studying inherited traits such as shape in Pisum sativum (peas). What Mendel learned from studying plants has had far-reaching benefits outside of botany. Similarly, \"jumping genes\" were discovered by Barbara McClintock while she was studying maize.[117] Nevertheless, there are some distinctive genetic differences between plants and other organisms.\nSpecies boundaries in plants may be weaker than in animals, and cross species hybrids are often possible. A familiar example is peppermint, Mentha × piperita, a sterile hybrid between Mentha aquatica and spearmint, Mentha spicata.[118] The many cultivated varieties of wheat are the result of multiple inter- and intra-specific crosses between wild species and their hybrids.[119] Angiosperms with monoecious flowers often have self-incompatibility mechanisms that operate between the pollen and stigma so that the pollen either fails to reach the stigma or fails to germinate and produce male gametes.[120] This is one of several methods used by plants to promote outcrossing.[121] In many land plants the male and female gametes are produced by separate individuals. These species are said to be dioecious when referring to vascular plant sporophytes and dioicous when referring to bryophyte gametophytes.[122]\nCharles Darwin in his 1878 book The Effects of Cross and Self-Fertilization in the Vegetable Kingdom[123] at the start of chapter XII noted \"The first and most important of the conclusions which may be drawn from the observations given in this volume, is that generally cross-fertilisation is beneficial and self-fertilisation often injurious, at least with the plants on which I experimented.\" An important adaptive benefit of outcrossing is that it allows the masking of deleterious mutations in the genome of progeny. This beneficial effect is also known as hybrid vigor or heterosis. Once outcrossing is established, subsequent switching to inbreeding becomes disadvantageous since it allows expression of the previously masked deleterious recessive mutations, commonly referred to as inbreeding depression.\nUnlike in higher animals, where parthenogenesis is rare, asexual reproduction may occur in plants by several different mechanisms. The formation of stem tubers in potato is one example. Particularly in arctic or alpine habitats, where opportunities for fertilisation of flowers by animals are rare, plantlets or bulbs, may develop instead of flowers, replacing sexual reproduction with asexual reproduction and giving rise to clonal populations genetically identical to the parent. This is one of several types of apomixis that occur in plants. Apomixis can also happen in a seed, producing a seed that contains an embryo genetically identical to the parent.[124]\nMost sexually reproducing organisms are diploid, with paired chromosomes, but doubling of their chromosome number may occur due to errors in cytokinesis. This can occur early in development to produce an autopolyploid or partly autopolyploid organism, or during normal processes of cellular differentiation to produce some cell types that are polyploid (endopolyploidy), or during gamete formation. An allopolyploid plant may result from a hybridisation event between two different species. Both autopolyploid and allopolyploid plants can often reproduce normally, but may be unable to cross-breed successfully with the parent population because there is a mismatch in chromosome numbers. These plants that are reproductively isolated from the parent species but live within the same geographical area, may be sufficiently successful to form a new species.[125] Some otherwise sterile plant polyploids can still reproduce vegetatively or by seed apomixis, forming clonal populations of identical individuals.[125] Durum wheat is a fertile tetraploid allopolyploid, while bread wheat is a fertile hexaploid. The commercial banana is an example of a sterile, seedless triploid hybrid. Common dandelion is a triploid that produces viable seeds by apomictic seed.\nAs in other eukaryotes, the inheritance of endosymbiotic organelles like mitochondria and chloroplasts in plants is non-Mendelian. Chloroplasts are inherited through the male parent in gymnosperms but often through the female parent in flowering plants.[126]\nMolecular genetics\n[edit]A considerable amount of new knowledge about plant function comes from studies of the molecular genetics of model plants such as the Thale cress, Arabidopsis thaliana, a weedy species in the mustard family (Brassicaceae).[93] The genome or hereditary information contained in the genes of this species is encoded by about 135 million base pairs of DNA, forming one of the smallest genomes among flowering plants. Arabidopsis was the first plant to have its genome sequenced, in 2000.[127] The sequencing of some other relatively small genomes, of rice (Oryza sativa)[128] and Brachypodium distachyon,[129] has made them important model species for understanding the genetics, cellular and molecular biology of cereals, grasses and monocots generally.\nModel plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana are used for studying the molecular biology of plant cells and the chloroplast. Ideally, these organisms have small genomes that are well known or completely sequenced, small stature and short generation times. Corn has been used to study mechanisms of photosynthesis and phloem loading of sugar in C4 plants.[130] The single celled green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, while not an embryophyte itself, contains a green-pigmented chloroplast related to that of land plants, making it useful for study.[131] A red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae has also been used to study some basic chloroplast functions.[132] Spinach,[133] peas,[134] soybeans and a moss Physcomitrella patens are commonly used to study plant cell biology.[135]\nAgrobacterium tumefaciens, a soil rhizosphere bacterium, can attach to plant cells and infect them with a callus-inducing Ti plasmid by horizontal gene transfer, causing a callus infection called crown gall disease. Schell and Van Montagu (1977) hypothesised that the Ti plasmid could be a natural vector for introducing the Nif gene responsible for nitrogen fixation in the root nodules of legumes and other plant species.[136] Today, genetic modification of the Ti plasmid is one of the main techniques for introduction of transgenes to plants and the creation of genetically modified crops.\nEpigenetics\n[edit]Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene function that cannot be explained by changes in the underlying DNA sequence[137] but cause the organism's genes to behave (or \"express themselves\") differently.[138] One example of epigenetic change is the marking of the genes by DNA methylation which determines whether they will be expressed or not. Gene expression can also be controlled by repressor proteins that attach to silencer regions of the DNA and prevent that region of the DNA code from being expressed. Epigenetic marks may be added or removed from the DNA during programmed stages of development of the plant, and are responsible, for example, for the differences between anthers, petals and normal leaves, despite the fact that they all have the same underlying genetic code. Epigenetic changes may be temporary or may remain through successive cell divisions for the remainder of the cell's life. Some epigenetic changes have been shown to be heritable,[139] while others are reset in the germ cells.\nEpigenetic changes in eukaryotic biology serve to regulate the process of cellular differentiation. During morphogenesis, totipotent stem cells become the various pluripotent cell lines of the embryo, which in turn become fully differentiated cells. A single fertilised egg cell, the zygote, gives rise to the many different plant cell types including parenchyma, xylem vessel elements, phloem sieve tubes, guard cells of the epidermis, etc. as it continues to divide. The process results from the epigenetic activation of some genes and inhibition of others.[140]\nUnlike animals, many plant cells, particularly those of the parenchyma, do not terminally differentiate, remaining totipotent with the ability to give rise to a new individual plant. Exceptions include highly lignified cells, the sclerenchyma and xylem which are dead at maturity, and the phloem sieve tubes which lack nuclei. While plants use many of the same epigenetic mechanisms as animals, such as chromatin remodelling, an alternative hypothesis is that plants set their gene expression patterns using positional information from the environment and surrounding cells to determine their developmental fate.[141]\nEpigenetic changes can lead to paramutations, which do not follow the Mendelian heritage rules. These epigenetic marks are carried from one generation to the next, with one allele inducing a change on the other.[142]\nPlant evolution\n[edit]The chloroplasts of plants have a number of biochemical, structural and genetic similarities to cyanobacteria, (commonly but incorrectly known as \"blue-green algae\") and are thought to be derived from an ancient endosymbiotic relationship between an ancestral eukaryotic cell and a cyanobacterial resident.[143][144][145][146]\nThe algae are a polyphyletic group and are placed in various divisions, some more closely related to plants than others. There are many differences between them in features such as cell wall composition, biochemistry, pigmentation, chloroplast structure and nutrient reserves. The algal division Charophyta, sister to the green algal division Chlorophyta, is considered to contain the ancestor of true plants.[147] The Charophyte class Charophyceae and the land plant sub-kingdom Embryophyta together form the monophyletic group or clade Streptophytina.[148]\nNonvascular land plants are embryophytes that lack the vascular tissues xylem and phloem. They include mosses, liverworts and hornworts. Pteridophytic vascular plants with true xylem and phloem that reproduced by spores germinating into free-living gametophytes evolved during the Silurian period and diversified into several lineages during the late Silurian and early Devonian. Representatives of the lycopods have survived to the present day. By the end of the Devonian period, several groups, including the lycopods, sphenophylls and progymnosperms, had independently evolved \"megaspory\" – their spores were of two distinct sizes, larger megaspores and smaller microspores. Their reduced gametophytes developed from megaspores retained within the spore-producing organs (megasporangia) of the sporophyte, a condition known as endospory. Seeds consist of an endosporic megasporangium surrounded by one or two sheathing layers (integuments). The young sporophyte develops within the seed, which on germination splits to release it. The earliest known seed plants date from the latest Devonian Famennian stage.[149][150] Following the evolution of the seed habit, seed plants diversified, giving rise to a number of now-extinct groups, including seed ferns, as well as the modern gymnosperms and angiosperms.[151] Gymnosperms produce \"naked seeds\" not fully enclosed in an ovary; modern representatives include conifers, cycads, Ginkgo, and Gnetales. Angiosperms produce seeds enclosed in a structure such as a carpel or an ovary.[152][153] Ongoing research on the molecular phylogenetics of living plants appears to show that the angiosperms are a sister clade to the gymnosperms.[154]\nPlant physiology\n[edit]Plant physiology encompasses all the internal chemical and physical activities of plants associated with life.[155] Chemicals obtained from the air, soil and water form the basis of all plant metabolism. The energy of sunlight, captured by oxygenic photosynthesis and released by cellular respiration, is the basis of almost all life. Photoautotrophs, including all green plants, algae and cyanobacteria gather energy directly from sunlight by photosynthesis. Heterotrophs including all animals, all fungi, all completely parasitic plants, and non-photosynthetic bacteria take in organic molecules produced by photoautotrophs and respire them or use them in the construction of cells and tissues.[156] Respiration is the oxidation of carbon compounds by breaking them down into simpler structures to release the energy they contain, essentially the opposite of photosynthesis.[157]\nMolecules are moved within plants by transport processes that operate at a variety of spatial scales. Subcellular transport of ions, electrons and molecules such as water and enzymes occurs across cell membranes. Minerals and water are transported from roots to other parts of the plant in the transpiration stream. Diffusion, osmosis, and active transport and mass flow are all different ways transport can occur.[158] Examples of elements that plants need to transport are nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and sulfur. In vascular plants, these elements are extracted from the soil as soluble ions by the roots and transported throughout the plant in the xylem. Most of the elements required for plant nutrition come from the chemical breakdown of soil minerals.[159] Sucrose produced by photosynthesis is transported from the leaves to other parts of the plant in the phloem and plant hormones are transported by a variety of processes.\nPlant hormones\n[edit]Plants are not passive, but respond to external signals such as light, touch, and injury by moving or growing towards or away from the stimulus, as appropriate. Tangible evidence of touch sensitivity is the almost instantaneous collapse of leaflets of Mimosa pudica, the insect traps of Venus flytrap and bladderworts, and the pollinia of orchids.[161]\nThe hypothesis that plant growth and development is coordinated by plant hormones or plant growth regulators first emerged in the late 19th century. Darwin experimented on the movements of plant shoots and roots towards light[162] and gravity, and concluded \"It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radicle . . acts like the brain of one of the lower animals . . directing the several movements\".[163] About the same time, the role of auxins (from the Greek auxein, to grow) in control of plant growth was first outlined by the Dutch scientist Frits Went.[164] The first known auxin, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), which promotes cell growth, was only isolated from plants about 50 years later.[165] This compound mediates the tropic responses of shoots and roots towards light and gravity.[166] The finding in 1939 that plant callus could be maintained in culture containing IAA, followed by the observation in 1947 that it could be induced to form roots and shoots by controlling the concentration of growth hormones were key steps in the development of plant biotechnology and genetic modification.[167]\nCytokinins are a class of plant hormones named for their control of cell division (especially cytokinesis). The natural cytokinin zeatin was discovered in corn, Zea mays, and is a derivative of the purine adenine. Zeatin is produced in roots and transported to shoots in the xylem where it promotes cell division, bud development, and the greening of chloroplasts.[168][169] The gibberelins, such as gibberelic acid are diterpenes synthesised from acetyl CoA via the mevalonate pathway. They are involved in the promotion of germination and dormancy-breaking in seeds, in regulation of plant height by controlling stem elongation and the control of flowering.[170] Abscisic acid (ABA) occurs in all land plants except liverworts, and is synthesised from carotenoids in the chloroplasts and other plastids. It inhibits cell division, promotes seed maturation, and dormancy, and promotes stomatal closure. It was so named because it was originally thought to control abscission.[171] Ethylene is a gaseous hormone that is produced in all higher plant tissues from methionine. It is now known to be the hormone that stimulates or regulates fruit ripening and abscission,[172][173] and it, or the synthetic growth regulator ethephon which is rapidly metabolised to produce ethylene, are used on industrial scale to promote ripening of cotton, pineapples and other climacteric crops.\nAnother class of phytohormones is the jasmonates, first isolated from the oil of Jasminum grandiflorum[174] which regulates wound responses in plants by unblocking the expression of genes required in the systemic acquired resistance response to pathogen attack.[175]\nIn addition to being the primary energy source for plants, light functions as a signalling device, providing information to the plant, such as how much sunlight the plant receives each day. This can result in adaptive changes in a process known as photomorphogenesis. Phytochromes are the photoreceptors in a plant that are sensitive to light.[176]\nPlant anatomy and morphology\n[edit]Plant anatomy is the study of the structure of plant cells and tissues, whereas plant morphology is the study of their external form.[177] All plants are multicellular eukaryotes, their DNA stored in nuclei.[178][179] The characteristic features of plant cells that distinguish them from those of animals and fungi include a primary cell wall composed of the polysaccharides cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin,[180] larger vacuoles than in animal cells and the presence of plastids with unique photosynthetic and biosynthetic functions as in the chloroplasts. Other plastids contain storage products such as starch (amyloplasts) or lipids (elaioplasts). Uniquely, streptophyte cells and those of the green algal order Trentepohliales[181] divide by construction of a phragmoplast as a template for building a cell plate late in cell division.[84]\nThe bodies of vascular plants including clubmosses, ferns and seed plants (gymnosperms and angiosperms) generally have aerial and subterranean subsystems. The shoots consist of stems bearing green photosynthesising leaves and reproductive structures. The underground vascularised roots bear root hairs at their tips and generally lack chlorophyll.[183] Non-vascular plants, the liverworts, hornworts and mosses do not produce ground-penetrating vascular roots and most of the plant participates in photosynthesis.[184] The sporophyte generation is nonphotosynthetic in liverworts but may be able to contribute part of its energy needs by photosynthesis in mosses and hornworts.[185]\nThe root system and the shoot system are interdependent – the usually nonphotosynthetic root system depends on the shoot system for food, and the usually photosynthetic shoot system depends on water and minerals from the root system.[183] Cells in each system are capable of creating cells of the other and producing adventitious shoots or roots.[186] Stolons and tubers are examples of shoots that can grow roots.[187] Roots that spread out close to the surface, such as those of willows, can produce shoots and ultimately new plants.[188] In the event that one of the systems is lost, the other can often regrow it. In fact it is possible to grow an entire plant from a single leaf, as is the case with plants in Streptocarpus sect. Saintpaulia,[189] or even a single cell – which can dedifferentiate into a callus (a mass of unspecialised cells) that can grow into a new plant.[186] In vascular plants, the xylem and phloem are the conductive tissues that transport resources between shoots and roots. Roots are often adapted to store food such as sugars or starch,[183] as in sugar beets and carrots.[188]\nStems mainly provide support to the leaves and reproductive structures, but can store water in succulent plants such as cacti, food as in potato tubers, or reproduce vegetatively as in the stolons of strawberry plants or in the process of layering.[190] Leaves gather sunlight and carry out photosynthesis.[191] Large, flat, flexible, green leaves are called foliage leaves.[192] Gymnosperms, such as conifers, cycads, Ginkgo, and gnetophytes are seed-producing plants with open seeds.[193] Angiosperms are seed-producing plants that produce flowers and have enclosed seeds.[152] Woody plants, such as azaleas and oaks, undergo a secondary growth phase resulting in two additional types of tissues: wood (secondary xylem) and bark (secondary phloem and cork). All gymnosperms and many angiosperms are woody plants.[194] Some plants reproduce sexually, some asexually, and some via both means.[195]\nAlthough reference to major morphological categories such as root, stem, leaf, and trichome are useful, one has to keep in mind that these categories are linked through intermediate forms so that a continuum between the categories results.[196] Furthermore, structures can be seen as processes, that is, process combinations.[49]\nSystematic botany\n[edit]Systematic botany is part of systematic biology, which is concerned with the range and diversity of organisms and their relationships, particularly as determined by their evolutionary history.[197] It involves, or is related to, biological classification, scientific taxonomy and phylogenetics. Biological classification is the method by which botanists group organisms into categories such as genera or species. Biological classification is a form of scientific taxonomy. Modern taxonomy is rooted in the work of Carl Linnaeus, who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics. These groupings have since been revised to align better with the Darwinian principle of common descent – grouping organisms by ancestry rather than superficial characteristics. While scientists do not always agree on how to classify organisms, molecular phylogenetics, which uses DNA sequences as data, has driven many recent revisions along evolutionary lines and is likely to continue to do so. The dominant classification system is called Linnaean taxonomy. It includes ranks and binomial nomenclature. The nomenclature of botanical organisms is codified in the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) and administered by the International Botanical Congress.[198][199]\nKingdom Plantae belongs to Domain Eukaryota and is broken down recursively until each species is separately classified. The order is: Kingdom; Phylum (or Division); Class; Order; Family; Genus (plural genera); Species. The scientific name of a plant represents its genus and its species within the genus, resulting in a single worldwide name for each organism.[199] For example, the tiger lily is Lilium columbianum. Lilium is the genus, and columbianum the specific epithet. The combination is the name of the species. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalise the first letter in the genus and put all of the specific epithet in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term is ordinarily italicised (or underlined when italics are not available).[200][201][202]\nThe evolutionary relationships and heredity of a group of organisms is called its phylogeny. Phylogenetic studies attempt to discover phylogenies. The basic approach is to use similarities based on shared inheritance to determine relationships.[203] As an example, species of Pereskia are trees or bushes with prominent leaves. They do not obviously resemble a typical leafless cactus such as an Echinocactus. However, both Pereskia and Echinocactus have spines produced from areoles (highly specialised pad-like structures) suggesting that the two genera are indeed related.[204][205]\nJudging relationships based on shared characters requires care, since plants may resemble one another through convergent evolution in which characters have arisen independently. Some euphorbias have leafless, rounded bodies adapted to water conservation similar to those of globular cacti, but characters such as the structure of their flowers make it clear that the two groups are not closely related. The cladistic method takes a systematic approach to characters, distinguishing between those that carry no information about shared evolutionary history – such as those evolved separately in different groups (homoplasies) or those left over from ancestors (plesiomorphies) – and derived characters, which have been passed down from innovations in a shared ancestor (apomorphies). Only derived characters, such as the spine-producing areoles of cacti, provide evidence for descent from a common ancestor. The results of cladistic analyses are expressed as cladograms: tree-like diagrams showing the pattern of evolutionary branching and descent.[206]\nFrom the 1990s onwards, the predominant approach to constructing phylogenies for living plants has been molecular phylogenetics, which uses molecular characters, particularly DNA sequences, rather than morphological characters like the presence or absence of spines and areoles. The difference is that the genetic code itself is used to decide evolutionary relationships, instead of being used indirectly via the characters it gives rise to. Clive Stace describes this as having \"direct access to the genetic basis of evolution.\"[207] As a simple example, prior to the use of genetic evidence, fungi were thought either to be plants or to be more closely related to plants than animals. Genetic evidence suggests that the true evolutionary relationship of multicelled organisms is as shown in the cladogram below – fungi are more closely related to animals than to plants.[208]\nIn 1998, the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group published a phylogeny for flowering plants based on an analysis of DNA sequences from most families of flowering plants. As a result of this work, many questions, such as which families represent the earliest branches of angiosperms, have now been answered.[54] Investigating how plant species are related to each other allows botanists to better understand the process of evolution in plants.[209] Despite the study of model plants and increasing use of DNA evidence, there is ongoing work and discussion among taxonomists about how best to classify plants into various taxa.[210] Technological developments such as computers and electron microscopes have greatly increased the level of detail studied and speed at which data can be analysed.[211]\nSymbols\n[edit]A few symbols are in current use in botany. A number of others are obsolete; for example, Linnaeus used planetary symbols ⟨♂⟩ (Mars) for biennial plants, ⟨♃⟩ (Jupiter) for herbaceous perennials and ⟨♄⟩ (Saturn) for woody perennials, based on the planets' orbital periods of 2, 12 and 30 years; and Willd used ⟨♄⟩ (Saturn) for neuter in addition to ⟨☿⟩ (Mercury) for hermaphroditic.[212] The following symbols are still used:[213]\n- ♀ female\n- ♂ male\n- ⚥ hermaphrodite/bisexual\n- ⚲ vegetative (asexual) reproduction\n- ◊ sex unknown\n- ☉ annual\n- ⚇ biennial\n- ♾ perennial\n- ☠ poisonous\n- 🛈 further information\n- × crossbred hybrid\n- + grafted hybrid\nSee also\n[edit]- Branches of botany\n- Evolution of plants\n- Floristics\n- Glossary of botanical terms\n- Glossary of plant morphology\n- List of botany journals\n- List of botanists\n- List of botanical gardens\n- List of botanists by author abbreviation\n- List of domesticated plants\n- List of flowers\n- List of systems of plant taxonomy\n- Outline of botany\n- Timeline of British botany\nNotes\n[edit]- ^ Chlorophyll b is also found in some cyanobacteria.

Also included are plant classification and the study of plant diseases and of interactions with the environment. The principles and findings of botany have provided the base for such applied sciences as agriculture, horticulture, and forestry.\nPlants were of paramount importance to early humans, who depended upon them as sources of food, shelter, clothing, medicine, ornament, tools, and magic. Today it is known that, in addition to their practical and economic values, green plants are indispensable to all life on Earth: through the process of photosynthesis, plants transform energy from the Sun into the chemical energy of food, which makes all life possible. A second unique and important capacity of green plants is the formation and release of oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis. The oxygen of the atmosphere, so absolutely essential to many forms of life, represents the accumulation of over 3,500,000,000 years of photosynthesis by green plants and algae.\nAlthough the many steps in the process of photosynthesis have become fully understood only in recent years, even in prehistoric times humans somehow recognized intuitively that some important relation existed between the Sun and plants. Such recognition is suggested by the fact that worship of the Sun was often combined with the worship of plants by early tribes and civilizations.\nEarliest humans, like the other anthropoid mammals (e.g., apes, monkeys), depended totally upon the natural resources of the environment, which, until methods were developed for hunting, consisted almost completely of plants. The behaviour of pre-Stone Age humans can be inferred by studying the botany of aboriginal peoples in various parts of the world. Isolated tribal groups in South America, Africa, and New Guinea, for example, have extensive knowledge about plants and distinguish hundreds of kinds according to their utility, as edible, poisonous, or otherwise important in their culture. They have developed sophisticated systems of nomenclature and classification, which approximate the binomial system (i.e., generic and specific names) found in modern biology. The urge to recognize different kinds of plants and to give them names thus seems to be as old as the human race.\nIn time plants were not only collected but also grown by humans. This domestication resulted not only in the development of agriculture but also in a greater stability of human populations that had previously been nomadic. From the settling down of agricultural peoples in places where they could depend upon adequate food supplies came the first villages and the earliest civilizations.\nBecause of the long preoccupation of humans with plants, a large body of folklore, general information, and actual scientific data has accumulated, which has become the basis for the science of botany.\nHistorical background\nTheophrastus, a Greek philosopher who first studied with Plato and then became a disciple of Aristotle, is credited with founding botany. Only two of an estimated 200 botanical treatises written by him are known to science: originally written in Greek about 300 bce, they have survived in the form of Latin manuscripts, De causis plantarum and De historia plantarum. His basic concepts of morphology, classification, and the natural history of plants, accepted without question for many centuries, are now of interest primarily because of Theophrastus’s independent and philosophical viewpoint.\nPedanius Dioscorides, a Greek botanist of the 1st century ce, was the most important botanical writer after Theophrastus. In his major work, an herbal in Greek, he described some 600 kinds of plants, with comments on their habit of growth and form as well as on their medicinal properties. Unlike Theophrastus, who classified plants as trees, shrubs, and herbs, Dioscorides grouped his plants under three headings: as aromatic, culinary, and medicinal. His herbal, unique in that it was the first treatment of medicinal plants to be illustrated, remained for about 15 centuries the last word on medical botany in Europe.\nFrom the 2nd century bce to the 1st century ce, a succession of Roman writers—Cato the Elder, Varro, Virgil, and Columella—prepared Latin manuscripts on farming, gardening, and fruit growing but showed little evidence of the spirit of scientific inquiry for its own sake that was so characteristic of Theophrastus. In the 1st century ce, Pliny the Elder, though no more original than his Roman predecessors, seemed more industrious as a compiler. His Historia naturalis—an encyclopaedia of 37 volumes, compiled from some 2,000 works representing 146 Roman and 327 Greek authors—has 16 volumes devoted to plants. Although uncritical and containing much misinformation, this work contains much information otherwise unavailable, since most of the volumes to which he referred have been destroyed.\nThe printing press revolutionized the availability of all types of literature, including that of plants. In the 15th and 16th centuries, many herbals were published with the purpose of describing plants useful in medicine. Written by physicians and medically oriented botanists, the earliest herbals were based largely on the work of Dioscorides and to a lesser extent on Theophrastus, but gradually they became the product of original observation. The increasing objectivity and originality of herbals through the decades is clearly reflected in the improved quality of the woodcuts prepared to illustrate these books.\nIn 1552 an illustrated manuscript on Mexican plants, written in Aztec, was translated into Latin by Badianus; other similar manuscripts known to have existed seem to have disappeared. Whereas herbals in China date back much further than those in Europe, they have become known only recently and so have contributed little to the progress of Western botany.\nThe invention of the optical lens during the 16th century and the development of the compound microscope about 1590 opened an era of rich discovery about plants; prior to that time, all observations by necessity had been made with the unaided eye. The botanists of the 17th century turned away from the earlier emphasis on medical botany and began to describe all plants, including the many new ones that were being introduced in large numbers from Asia, Africa, and America. Among the most prominent botanists of this era was Gaspard Bauhin, who for the first time developed, in a tentative way, many botanical concepts still held as valid.\nIn 1665 Robert Hooke published, under the title Micrographia, the results of his microscopic observations on several plant tissues. He is remembered as the coiner of the word “cell,” referring to the cavities he observed in thin slices of cork; his observation that living cells contain sap and other materials too often has been forgotten. In the following decade, Nehemiah Grew and Marcello Malpighi founded plant anatomy; in 1671 they communicated the results of microscopic studies simultaneously to the Royal Society of London, and both later published major treatises.\nExperimental plant physiology began with the brilliant work of Stephen Hales, who published his observations on the movements of water in plants under the title Vegetable Staticks (1727). His conclusions on the mechanics of water transpiration in plants are still valid, as is his discovery—at the time a startling one—that air contributes something to the materials produced by plants. In 1774, Joseph Priestley showed that plants exposed to sunlight give off oxygen, and Jan Ingenhousz demonstrated, in 1779, that plants in the dark give off carbon dioxide. In 1804 Nicolas de Saussure demonstrated convincingly that plants in sunlight absorb water and carbon dioxide and increase in weight, as had been reported by Hales nearly a century earlier.\nThe widespread use of the microscope by plant morphologists provided a turning point in the 18th century—botany became largely a laboratory science. Until the invention of simple lenses and the compound microscope, the recognition and classification of plants were, for the most part, based on such large morphological aspects of the plant as size, shape, and external structure of leaves, roots, and stems. Such information was also supplemented by observations on more subjective qualities of plants, such as edibility and medicinal uses.\nIn 1753 Linnaeus published his master work, Species Plantarum, which contains careful descriptions of 6,000 species of plants from all of the parts of the world known at the time. In this work, which is still the basic reference work for modern plant taxonomy, Linnaeus established the practice of binomial nomenclature—that is, the denomination of each kind of plant by two words, the genus name and the specific name, as Rosa canina, the dog rose. Binomial nomenclature had been introduced much earlier by some of the herbalists, but it was not generally accepted; most botanists continued to use cumbersome formal descriptions, consisting of many words, to name a plant. Linnaeus for the first time put the contemporary knowledge of plants into an orderly system, with full acknowledgment to past authors, and produced a nomenclatural methodology so useful that it has not been greatly improved upon. Linnaeus also introduced a “sexual system” of plants, by which the numbers of flower parts—especially stamens, which produce male sex cells, and styles, which are prolongations of plant ovaries that receive pollen grains—became useful tools for easy identification of plants. This simple system, though effective, had many imperfections. Other classification systems, in which as many characters as possible were considered in order to determine the degree of relationship, were developed by other botanists; indeed, some appeared before the time of Linnaeus. The application of the concepts of Charles Darwin (on evolution) and Gregor Mendel (on genetics) to plant taxonomy has provided insights into the process of evolution and the production of new species.\nSystematic botany now uses information and techniques from all the subdisciplines of botany, incorporating them into one body of knowledge. Phytogeography (the biogeography of plants), plant ecology, population genetics, and various techniques applicable to cells—cytotaxonomy and cytogenetics—have contributed greatly to the current status of systematic botany and have to some degree become part of it. More recently, phytochemistry, computerized statistics, and fine-structure morphology have been added to the activities of systematic botany.\nThe 20th century saw an enormous increase in the rate of growth of research in botany and the results derived therefrom. The combination of more botanists, better facilities, and new technologies, all with the benefit of experience from the past, resulted in a series of new discoveries, new concepts, and new fields of botanical endeavour. Some important examples are mentioned below.\nNew and more precise information is being accumulated concerning the process of photosynthesis, especially with reference to energy-transfer mechanisms.\nThe discovery of the pigment phytochrome, which constitutes a previously unknown light-detecting system in plants, has greatly increased knowledge of the influence of both internal and external environment on the germination of seeds and the time of flowering.\nSeveral types of plant hormones (internal regulatory substances) have been discovered—among them auxin, gibberellin, and kinetin—whose interactions provide a new concept of the way in which the plant functions as a unit.\nThe discovery that plants need certain trace elements usually found in the soil has made it possible to cultivate areas lacking some essential element by adding it to the deficient soil.\nThe development of genetical methods for the control of plant heredity has made possible the generation of improved and enormously productive crop plants.\nThe development of radioactive-carbon dating of plant materials as old as 50,000 years is useful to the paleobotanist, the ecologist, the archaeologist, and especially to the climatologist, who now has a better basis on which to predict climates of future centuries.\nThe discovery of alga-like and bacteria-like fossils in Precambrian rocks has pushed the estimated origin of plants on Earth to 3,500,000,000 years ago.\nThe isolation of antibiotic substances from fungi and bacteria-like organisms has provided control over many bacterial diseases and has contributed biochemical information of basic scientific importance as well.\nThe use of phylogenetic data to establish a consensus on the taxonomy and evolutionary lineages of angiosperms (flowering plants) is coordinated through an international effort known as the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group.",

          "content": "What can I do with a major in Botany?\nWhat Is Botany?\nBotany is the scientific study of plantshow plants function, what they look like, how they are related to each other, where they grow, how people make use of plants, and how plants evolved. Botany often includes the study of algae, may deal with fungi and bacteria, and usually explores the lives of plants, from tiny floating duckweeds to gigantic redwood trees. Plants are essential to the lives of humans, providing all our foodeither directly or indirectlyas well as the oxygen we breathe. In addition, the plant kingdom is natures medicine cabinet because plants are the source of many of the most important remedies used today. Some plants produce beautiful flowers for which people pay hundreds of dollars, plants and plant materials are worn by people, and some plants produce toxins that kill animals, including humans. Plants are the foundation of all terrestrial communities, and they dramatically affect the worlds climate, the global cycles of nutrients and water, as well as the lives of animals every day.\nWhy Study Botany?\nBecause plants are so diverse, botanists--who are scientists that study plants--share a common interest in and curiosity about the hundreds of thousands of species of plants on earth. While some botanists earn a Ph.D. and may conduct research and teach at a college or university, many more botanists earn a bachelors degree and find careers in a wide variety of places and occupations. If you want to work in a tropical forest or on a farm, studying Botany can help prepare you. If you want to search for new medicines or advance the frontiers in the study of cellular and molecular plant processes, working with a botanist can lead you in the right direction. If you want to understand ecological and global processes, botanical knowledge is critical. If you want to become a doctor or a dentist or work in the health professions, a Botany degree can be used as a means to your goal. Or, if you just want to learn how to grow bigger vegetables, more colorful flowers, or healthier lawns, Botany will be extremely beneficial to you.\nWhat Can I Study?\nWhere Can I Work?\nThe need for botanists and those trained in botany will continue to grow in the future. The headline of a recent news article from the journal Nature was, \"U.S. universities find that demand for botanists exceeds supply.\" Businesses, industry, and research centers are also looking for botanists. For instance, the Danforth Plant Science Center in St. Louis recently opened and now employs many botanists to increase understanding of basic plant biology, to apply new knowledge for the benefit of human nutrition and health, and to improve the sustainability of agriculture worldwide. In Oklahoma, the S. R. Noble Foundation employs botanists who investigate how to enhance plant productivity through fundamental research and applied biotechnology. As the population of people on earth continues to explode, the need to produce more productive crops and more nutritious foods will depend on the talents of botanists. Because all people use resources and produce wastes, there will also be increasing pressures on the environment with a need for botanists to help solve problems with air, water, and soil pollution and to preserve the ecosystems around the globe. The world is constantly changing, but the need for future botanists remains strong.\nPOSSIBLE EMPLOYERS\nBotany Career Websites for Jobs:\nInternships and Information\nFor more information, visit the Departmental website, contact the Department by e-mail at e-response form or the chairman, Gordon Uno at or sent postal mail to: Gordon Uno, Chairman, Department of Botany and Microbiology, University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK 73019",

          "content": "Whether you call it botany, plant science or plant biology, it is one of the world's oldest natural sciences. That means that most colleges and universities will have a botany or plant science degree in their Natural Science or Biology department. Many of the top universities have botany degrees, but there has been a decline in recent years of students taking botany in favour of other environmental and natural sciences. Plant studies will also form part of most biology undergraduate degrees but when moving onto post-graduate study, this becomes increasingly specialised. There are MS degrees in botany at the major universities in most states and botany graduates can enter many fields and with its popularity in decline while still requiring the skills, graduates with a BS should experience little difficulty obtaining employment in their chosen field. Botany graduates enter a diverse range of fields from science communication to agriculture, weed control to soil science, and landscape studies and conservation to teaching biology in our high schools (1). As with most research roles, a Master's Degree is typically expected.\nThe word “botany”, like many the names of many other scientific studies, comes from Ancient Greek botan�\" - a word that has multiple meanings including “pasture” or “fodder”. It includes anything that could be considered a plant, including flowering plants, algae, fungi and vascular plants such as ferns. It generally includes trees (2) but more often than not and increasingly, this is a specialised area. Today, it is part of a wider study of ecology and all the attributes of natural science that that implies (6).\nBotany is surprisingly useful in areas we wouldn't automatically consider it to have applications. Many of our early medicines come from plant extracts; aspirin developed as a result of the study of rotting tree bark and penicillin came from mould (3). With the effects of climate change expected to have a profound effect on our the world around us, especially on plants as we rely on them to provide carbon sinks amongst other things, the need to study botany is as important today as it ever was (4).\nLearn more about how to become a botanist.\nHistory of Botany\nThough the science botany as we understand it today starting out during the period of European colonialism as an area of study by landowners of the plants and trees on their land and the exotic specimens they would bring back from their travels, human interest in plants goes back much further. Arguably, it is the dawn of the Neolithic Revolution some 12,000 years ago and even beyond that when humans sought to identify plants with healing properties, their growing seasons, those that could or could not be eaten, how to selectively breed them for hardiness or larger yields, fruits and vegetables have all been vital to our social development. Even before there was science as we understand it, humanity has studied plants scientifically and it was this knowledge that drive the Agricultural Revolution (5) in developing crops amongst other things.\nCivilisation means surplus society, and when we refer to surplus we usually mean crops - through the near Middle East, civilisation spread out and it is mostly due to developing farming methods of the Neolithic. Ancient Greece and Rome were periods of great learning and it is no wonder then that there are prominent figures that drove the science forward as best they could. Aristotle, Theophrastus and Dioscorides were important early figures to plant study and Theophrastus is known as “The Father of Botany” because of two seminal works that were used for the next 1500 years and survive today (6). Nor is study limited to western civilisation, Chinese civilisation made about the same sort of progress as Greek civilisation around the same time and there may have been some trade of knowledge thanks to The Silk Road.\nFor the next 1500 years, there would be little development and most botanical studies were limited to places of learning such as universities and monasteries. Physic gardens were popular at some of the largest monasteries in the Christian world and these were vital for what limited research went on into the medical attributes of plants - most of this knowledge though was what had been passed on from Greek and Roman civilisation (7).\nAs with many sciences, the Renaissance and Reformation and the dawn of the Enlightenment opened up plant study. The microscope was invented in the late 16th century which allowed us to study plants like never before (6) - including the smaller parts such as phytoliths and pollen. Not only could we learn about the plants themselves, but also study their reproduction, metabolism and other aspects that had until then, been closed off to us.\nNot only were researchers interested in the science, but average people were starting to enjoy plants in themselves rather than purely for functional reasons. Public gardens were founded all over the western world and rich landowners turned over vast tracts of land for parks and gardens (7). When originally opened, most botanic gardens were dedicated to classification, labelling and the trading of seeds. Today, these are vital research centres often tied to universities.\nThe BSA (Botanical Society of America) was founded in 1893 and though at the time the organisation accepted members from USA and Canada, today it is one of the foremost botanical organisations with members all over the world (8). It is during this century that many other countries established botanical societies thanks to the growing interest in plants and the gaining momentum of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. Botany has seen resurgence in the last few decades thanks to a growing awareness of the effects of climate change. We may have learnt much about most individual plants but in the coming years they will be vital in teaching us about the ecology of the future (7).\nDivisions of Botany\nBotany today is such a large and varied area and has many important uses in a wide variety of disciplines, that it has evolved several niches and offshoots. The most notable are as follows, but this list is not exhaustive:\nPlant Pathology\nIt is often tragedy that drives scientific discovery and the Irish Potato Blight of the 19th century is the one period where most advances in research of plant diseases were made - many researchers put their efforts into plant pathology - the reasons should be obvious, if disease wipes out a large proportion of a staple crop then people starve. The Irish 1840s “Potato Famine” drove immigration for a large number of Irish to North America largely because of the disease that had affected the crops they had come to rely on (9). With Potato Blight, the tuber or the roots rot, rendering the whole crop useless. The mass spread of this disease caused one of the greatest famines anywhere in the western world and has never been seen since. Today, plant pathology is still a vital component of botany as we attempt to adapt crops to the changing climate and keep one step ahead of evolving diseases.\nAn ongoing research problem for plant pathologists is how to tackle the many diseases that threaten bananas. The limited genetic make-up and the seedless nature of modern cultivars means that several types have already gone extinct and several others remain under threat (10). Plant pathology is vital to understanding disease as well as the potential problems caused by climate change.\nPlant Ecology\nPlant ecology differs from botany in that it is more concerned with how plants interact with their environment - with and in soils, with animal species, how it reacts to ecological change such as climate change and many more issues of the wider landscape (11). This is vital in a world understanding and adapting to climate change in working out how to breed or otherwise alter our staple plants to survive and adapt to changing environments. It is also vital to the growing science of GM crops and cross-breeding for hardier crops to grow in what we call “marginal landscapes” as human population increases and require more land.\nPlant ecology recognises eleven major types of environment in which plant life exists: tropical forest, temperate forest, coniferous forests, tropical savannah, temperate grassland/plain, desert and other arid ecosystems, Mediterranean-like regions, terrestrial wetlands, freshwater ecology, coastal/marine ecology and tundra. Each has its own ecological profile, and balanced plant and animal life and how these interact is as important as each plant's profile in order that we can understand their evolution.\nPalaeobotany\nPalaeobotany is the study of extinct plants (6) or fossilised plants recovered from geological strata (12). Palaeobotanists will also study fossilised algae, bacteria, fungi and lichens - just as botanists study modern plants in these taxa. Palaeobotany has been fundamental to understand the changing climate of the past. It shows us what the ecological make-up of each climate zone was like at any given period of our distant past. Extensive studies in South America have shown precisely how and when the tropical rainforests there developed (13) and what conditions led to their evolution. We also expect that such information will tell us about how they might change in future in light of a changing climate. Palaeobotany is also shedding light on the nature and the extent of plant species during the Ice Age. One study examined the land bridge between modern Siberia and Alaska, showing how people lived there and may have crossed this land bridge in antiquity (14).\nArchaeobotany\nThough most researchers in this area come from an archaeological or anthropological background, a botanist will have the tools to enter into the field of studying how people in the past used plants. This discipline can be functional - in terms of looking at the spread of crop farming (12), wetland drainage, irrigation and other forms of ecological engineering - but it can also teach us about how people of the past experienced plants. As we have already discussed, some plants have medicinal properties and others have had - and continue to have - spiritual significance. Sometimes understanding the plant can also help us to understand the beliefs of the past (13). Archaeobotanists will not just look at plant remains in the soil, but residues in broken pottery and on stone tools for example.\nIn understanding how environments change, it is vital to separate changes wrought upon a landscape by nature from changes made as a result of human ecological engineering. Seeds and other plant remains can be great indicators for change, and archaeobotany (14) has been vital for tracking the spread of the Neolithic Revolution as landscapes undergo wholesale change purely because of human changes - and by extension, in some cases the spread of the market economy.\nForensic Botany\nCriminal investigations use whatever evidence they can find and in the last few decades, forensics has been the area with the most innovation and development. What can plants tell us about a crime scene, or a body? As with pollen and other minute plant remains, when we understand the make-up and profile of certain plants, plant evidence can tell us quite a lot.\nA forensic botanist will not typically study human remains (15) but will look at plant evidence recovered from bodies or will use criteria that could tell us where a body has been or is presently buried. One of the most important cases ever, and criminal historians will say that it was the case where botany was first employed in a criminal trial, is that of the abduction of Charles Lindbergh's son. A tree expert was called as a witness for the prosecution and his evidence indicated that the abductor was most likely an expert carpenter to have designed and built such a complex and unique ladder to aid the abduction; the strong testimony was permitted into the evidence base (16). Forensic botany, and the use of plants as evidence in a criminal trial, has come a long way since then and evidence has been known to determine whether death was a result of homicide, suicide or misadventure (17).\nSources\n- http://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/courses/options/botany/\n- https://botany.org/home/careers-jobs/careers-in-botany/what-is-botany.html\n- http://www.livescience.com/14016-natural-products-nih.html\n- https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/19/10/1797/1259152\n- http://science.jrank.org/pages/996/Botany.html\n- https://botany.org/home/about/an-historical-overview-of-the-bsa.html\n- http://www.botany.hawaii.edu/faculty/wong/BOT135/LECT06.HTM\n- http://conservationmagazine.org/2008/09/the-sterile-banana/\n- http://www.maneyonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/174963106x123232\n- http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/asi/summary/v044/44.1paz.html\n- http://anthro.vancouver.wsu.edu/media/PDF/Archaeobotany_at_Harappa_2003.pdf\n- http://www.sfu.museum/forensics/eng/pg_media-media_pg/botanique-botany/\n- http://neuron.mefst.hr/docs/CMJ/issues/2005/46/4/16100764.pdf\n- Guide to Parasitology - November 19, 2018\n- Deserts as Ecosystems and Why They Need Protecting - November 19, 2018\n- Conservation: History and Future - September 14, 2018\nRelated Articles\nFeatured Article\nPrinciples and Applications of Geographic Information Systems (GIS)",

          "content": "Microbiology\nMicrobiology (from Ancient Greek μῑκρος (mīkros) 'small' βίος (bíos) 'life' and -λογία (-logía) 'study of') is the scientific study of microorganisms, those being of unicellular (single-celled), multicellular (consisting of complex cells), or acellular (lacking cells).[1][2] Microbiology encompasses numerous sub-disciplines including virology, bacteriology, protistology, mycology, immunology, and parasitology.\nThe organisms that constitute the microbial world are characterized as either prokaryotes or eukaryotes; Eukaryotic microorganisms possess membrane-bound organelles and include fungi and protists, whereas prokaryotic organisms are conventionally classified as lacking membrane-bound organelles and include Bacteria and Archaea.[3][4] Microbiologists traditionally relied on culture, staining, and microscopy for the isolation and identification of microorganisms. However, less than 1% of the microorganisms present in common environments can be cultured in isolation using current means.[5] With the emergence of biotechnology, Microbiologists currently rely on molecular biology tools such as DNA sequence-based identification, for example, the 16S rRNA gene sequence used for bacterial identification.\nViruses have been variably classified as organisms[6] because they have been considered either very simple microorganisms or very complex molecules. Prions, never considered microorganisms, have been investigated by virologists; however, as the clinical effects traced to them were originally presumed due to chronic viral infections, virologists took a search—discovering \"infectious proteins\".\nThe existence of microorganisms was predicted many centuries before they were first observed, for example by the Jains in India and by Marcus Terentius Varro in ancient Rome. The first recorded microscope observation was of the fruiting bodies of moulds, by Robert Hooke in 1666, but the Jesuit priest Athanasius Kircher was likely the first to see microbes, which he mentioned observing in milk and putrid material in 1658. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek is considered a father of microbiology as he observed and experimented with microscopic organisms in the 1670s, using simple microscopes of his design. Scientific microbiology developed in the 19th century through the work of Louis Pasteur and in medical microbiology Robert Koch.\nHistory\n[edit]The existence of microorganisms was hypothesized for many centuries before their actual discovery. The existence of unseen microbiological life was postulated by Jainism which is based on Mahavira's teachings as early as 6th century BCE (599 BC - 527 BC).[7]: 24 Paul Dundas notes that Mahavira asserted the existence of unseen microbiological creatures living in earth, water, air and fire.[7]: 88 Jain scriptures describe nigodas which are sub-microscopic creatures living in large clusters and having a very short life, said to pervade every part of the universe, even in tissues of plants and flesh of animals.[8] The Roman Marcus Terentius Varro made references to microbes when he warned against locating a homestead in the vicinity of swamps \"because there are bred certain minute creatures which cannot be seen by the eyes, which float in the air and enter the body through the mouth and nose and thereby cause serious diseases.\"[9]\nPersian scientists hypothesized the existence of microorganisms, such as Avicenna in his book The Canon of Medicine, Ibn Zuhr (also known as Avenzoar) who discovered scabies mites, and Al-Razi who gave the earliest known description of smallpox in his book The Virtuous Life (al-Hawi).[10] The tenth-century Taoist Baoshengjing describes \"countless micro organic worms\" which resemble vegetable seeds, which prompted Dutch sinologist Kristofer Schipper to claim that \"the existence of harmful bacteria was known to the Chinese of the time.\"[11]\nIn 1546, Girolamo Fracastoro proposed that epidemic diseases were caused by transferable seedlike entities that could transmit infection by direct or indirect contact, or vehicle transmission.[12]\nIn 1676, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, who lived most of his life in Delft, Netherlands, observed bacteria and other microorganisms using a single-lens microscope of his own design.[14][2] He is considered a father of microbiology as he used simple single-lensed microscopes of his own design.[14] While Van Leeuwenhoek is often cited as the first to observe microbes, Robert Hooke made his first recorded microscopic observation, of the fruiting bodies of moulds, in 1665.[15] It has, however, been suggested that a Jesuit priest called Athanasius Kircher was the first to observe microorganisms.[16]\nKircher was among the first to design magic lanterns for projection purposes, and so he was well acquainted with the properties of lenses.[16] He wrote \"Concerning the wonderful structure of things in nature, investigated by Microscope\" in 1646, stating \"who would believe that vinegar and milk abound with an innumerable multitude of worms.\" He also noted that putrid material is full of innumerable creeping animalcules. He published his Scrutinium Pestis (Examination of the Plague) in 1658, stating correctly that the disease was caused by microbes, though what he saw was most likely red or white blood cells rather than the plague agent itself.[16]\nThe birth of bacteriology\n[edit]The field of bacteriology (later a subdiscipline of microbiology) was founded in the 19th century by Ferdinand Cohn, a botanist whose studies on algae and photosynthetic bacteria led him to describe several bacteria including Bacillus and Beggiatoa. Cohn was also the first to formulate a scheme for the taxonomic classification of bacteria, and to discover endospores.[17] Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch were contemporaries of Cohn, and are often considered to be the fathers of modern microbiology[16] and medical microbiology, respectively.[18] Pasteur is most famous for his series of experiments designed to disprove the then widely held theory of spontaneous generation, thereby solidifying microbiology's identity as a biological science.[19] One of his students, Adrien Certes, is considered the founder of marine microbiology.[20] Pasteur also designed methods for food preservation (pasteurization) and vaccines against several diseases such as anthrax, fowl cholera and rabies.[2] Koch is best known for his contributions to the germ theory of disease, proving that specific diseases were caused by specific pathogenic microorganisms. He developed a series of criteria that have become known as the Koch's postulates. Koch was one of the first scientists to focus on the isolation of bacteria in pure culture resulting in his description of several novel bacteria including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis.[2]\nWhile Pasteur and Koch are often considered the founders of microbiology, their work did not accurately reflect the true diversity of the microbial world because of their exclusive focus on microorganisms having direct medical relevance. It was not until the late 19th century and the work of Martinus Beijerinck and Sergei Winogradsky that the true breadth of microbiology was revealed.[2] Beijerinck made two major contributions to microbiology: the discovery of viruses and the development of enrichment culture techniques.[21] While his work on the tobacco mosaic virus established the basic principles of virology, it was his development of enrichment culturing that had the most immediate impact on microbiology by allowing for the cultivation of a wide range of microbes with wildly different physiologies. Winogradsky was the first to develop the concept of chemolithotrophy and to thereby reveal the essential role played by microorganisms in geochemical processes.[22] He was responsible for the first isolation and description of both nitrifying and nitrogen-fixing bacteria.[2] French-Canadian microbiologist Felix d'Herelle co-discovered bacteriophages in 1917 and was one of the earliest applied microbiologists.[23]\nJoseph Lister was the first to use phenol disinfectant on the open wounds of patients.[24]\nBranches\n[edit]The branches of microbiology can be classified into applied sciences, or divided according to taxonomy, as is the case with bacteriology, mycology, protozoology, virology, phycology, and microbial ecology. There is considerable overlap between the specific branches of microbiology with each other and with other disciplines, and certain aspects of these branches can extend beyond the traditional scope of microbiology.[25][26] A pure research branch of microbiology is termed cellular microbiology.\nApplications\n[edit]While some people have fear of microbes due to the association of some microbes with various human diseases, many microbes are also responsible for numerous beneficial processes such as industrial fermentation (e.g. the production of alcohol, vinegar and dairy products), antibiotic production can act as molecular vehicles to transfer DNA to complex organisms such as plants and animals. Scientists have also exploited their knowledge of microbes to produce biotechnologically important enzymes such as Taq polymerase,[27] reporter genes for use in other genetic systems and novel molecular biology techniques such as the yeast two-hybrid system.[28]\nBacteria can be used for the industrial production of amino acids. organic acids, vitamin, proteins, antibiotics and other commercially used metabolites which are produced by microorganisms. Corynebacterium glutamicum is one of the most important bacterial species with an annual production of more than two million tons of amino acids, mainly L-glutamate and L-lysine.[29] Since some bacteria have the ability to synthesize antibiotics, they are used for medicinal purposes, such as Streptomyces to make aminoglycoside antibiotics.[30]\nA variety of biopolymers, such as polysaccharides, polyesters, and polyamides, are produced by microorganisms. Microorganisms are used for the biotechnological production of biopolymers with tailored properties suitable for high-value medical application such as tissue engineering and drug delivery. Microorganisms are for example used for the biosynthesis of xanthan, alginate, cellulose, cyanophycin, poly(gamma-glutamic acid), levan, hyaluronic acid, organic acids, oligosaccharides polysaccharide and polyhydroxyalkanoates.[31]\nMicroorganisms are beneficial for microbial biodegradation or bioremediation of domestic, agricultural and industrial wastes and subsurface pollution in soils, sediments and marine environments. The ability of each microorganism to degrade toxic waste depends on the nature of each contaminant. Since sites typically have multiple pollutant types, the most effective approach to microbial biodegradation is to use a mixture of bacterial and fungal species and strains, each specific to the biodegradation of one or more types of contaminants.[32]\nSymbiotic microbial communities confer benefits to their human and animal hosts health including aiding digestion, producing beneficial vitamins and amino acids, and suppressing pathogenic microbes. Some benefit may be conferred by eating fermented foods, probiotics (bacteria potentially beneficial to the digestive system) or prebiotics (substances consumed to promote the growth of probiotic microorganisms).[33][34] The ways the microbiome influences human and animal health, as well as methods to influence the microbiome are active areas of research.[35]\nResearch has suggested that microorganisms could be useful in the treatment of cancer. Various strains of non-pathogenic clostridia can infiltrate and replicate within solid tumors. Clostridial vectors can be safely administered and their potential to deliver therapeutic proteins has been demonstrated in a variety of preclinical models.[36]\nSome bacteria are used to study fundamental mechanisms. An example of model bacteria used to study motility[37] or the production of polysaccharides and development is Myxococcus xanthus.[38]\nSee also\n[edit]- Professional organizations\n- American Society for Microbiology\n- Federation of European Microbiological Societies\n- Society for Applied Microbiology\n- Society for General Microbiology\n- Journals\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ \"Microbiology\".

          "content": "What is microbiology?\nMicrobiology is the study of microbes. Microbes, which are also called micro-organisms, are a group of organisms that are too small to be seen with the naked eye. Despite being even smaller than the human cell, microbes still vary dramatically in size, with most viruses being up to 100 times smaller than the average bacterium. Microbes are the oldest life form on this planet and there is even fossil evidence in Australian rocks of microbial communities living 3.48 billion years ago[1].\nMicrobes that cause disease are called pathogens. While it might seem that they make up a large proportion of the microbes on our planet, human pathogens account for less than 1% of microbial species[2].\nWhy does microbiology matter?\nSome of the most important discoveries that have underpinned modern society have resulted from the research of famous microbiologists, such as Edward Jenner and his vaccine against smallpox; Alexander Fleming and the discovery of penicillin and Harald zur Hausen, who identified the link between papilloma virus and cervical cancer. In recent years, microbiologists were integral in the response to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, they mapped its genome, monitored it’s spread and created vaccines to protect us.\nBy studying small things, microbiologists can answer some big questions which affect many aspects of our lives, from degrading food waste to causing and curing disease. The study of microbes helps us to understand our world and our place within it.\nSome of the questions microbiologists are looking to answer:\n- Can microbes help solve the climate crisis?\n- How do microbes influence climate change?\n- How do we prevent the next pandemic?\n- How do we tackle antimicrobial resistance?\n- Can we predict future disease outbreaks?\n- How do our microbiomes influence our health?\n- How can microbes impact biosecurity?\n- Does microbial life exist elsewhere in the universe?\nIntroducing microbes\nOur work\nImage: Protozoa under a microscope iStock/wir0man\n[1] Noffke N, Christian D, Wacey D, Hazen RM.

          "content": "microbiology\nmicrobiology, study of microorganisms, or microbes, a diverse group of generally minute simple life-forms that include bacteria, archaea, algae, fungi, protozoa, and viruses. The field is concerned with the structure, function, and classification of such organisms and with ways of both exploiting and controlling their activities.\nThe 17th-century discovery of living forms existing invisible to the naked eye was a significant milestone in the history of science, for from the 13th century onward it had been postulated that “invisible” entities were responsible for decay and disease. The word microbe was coined in the last quarter of the 19th century to describe these organisms, all of which were thought to be related. As microbiology eventually developed into a specialized science, it was found that microbes are a very large group of extremely diverse organisms.\nDaily life is interwoven inextricably with microorganisms. In addition to populating both the inner and outer surfaces of the human body, microbes abound in the soil, in the seas, and in the air. Abundant, although usually unnoticed, microorganisms provide ample evidence of their presence—sometimes unfavourably, as when they cause decay of materials or spread diseases, and sometimes favourably, as when they ferment sugar to wine and beer, cause bread to rise, flavour cheeses, and produce valued products such as antibiotics and insulin. Microorganisms are of incalculable value to Earth’s ecology, disintegrating animal and plant remains and converting them to simpler substances that can be recycled in other organisms.\nHistorical background\nMicrobiology essentially began with the development of the microscope. Although others may have seen microbes before him, it was Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, a Dutch draper whose hobby was lens grinding and making microscopes, who was the first to provide proper documentation of his observations. His descriptions and drawings included protozoans from the guts of animals and bacteria from teeth scrapings. His records were excellent because he produced magnifying lenses of exceptional quality. Leeuwenhoek conveyed his findings in a series of letters to the British Royal Society during the mid-1670s. Although his observations stimulated much interest, no one made a serious attempt either to repeat or to extend them. Leeuwenhoek’s “animalcules,” as he called them, thus remained mere oddities of nature to the scientists of his day, and enthusiasm for the study of microbes grew slowly. It was only later, during the 18th-century revival of a long-standing controversy about whether life could develop out of nonliving material, that the significance of microorganisms in the scheme of nature and in the health and welfare of humans became evident.\nSpontaneous generation versus biotic generation of life\nThe early Greeks believed that living things could originate from nonliving matter (abiogenesis) and that the goddess Gea could create life from stones. Aristotle discarded this notion, but he still held that animals could arise spontaneously from dissimilar organisms or from soil. His influence regarding this concept of spontaneous generation was still felt as late as the 17th century, but toward the end of that century a chain of observations, experiments, and arguments began that eventually refuted the idea. This advance in understanding was hard fought, involving series of events, with forces of personality and individual will often obscuring the facts.\nAlthough Francesco Redi, an Italian physician, disproved in 1668 that higher forms of life could originate spontaneously, proponents of the concept claimed that microbes were different and did indeed arise in this way. Such illustrious names as John Needham and Lazzaro Spallanzani were adversaries in this debate during the mid-1700s. In the early half of the 1800s, Franz Schulze and Theodor Schwann were major figures in the attempt to disprove theories of abiogenesis until Louis Pasteur finally announced the results of his conclusive experiments in 1864. In a series of masterful experiments, Pasteur proved that only preexisting microbes could give rise to other microbes (biogenesis). Modern and accurate knowledge of the forms of bacteria can be attributed to German botanist Ferdinand Cohn, whose chief results were published between 1853 and 1892. Cohn’s classification of bacteria, published in 1872 and extended in 1875, dominated the study of these organisms thereafter.\nMicrobes and disease\nGirolamo Fracastoro, an Italian scholar, advanced the notion as early as the mid-1500s that contagion is an infection that passes from one thing to another. A description of precisely what is passed along eluded discovery until the late 1800s, when the work of many scientists, Pasteur foremost among them, determined the role of bacteria in fermentation and disease. Robert Koch, a German physician, defined the procedure (Koch’s postulates) for proving that a specific organism causes a specific disease.\nThe foundation of microbiology was securely laid during the period from about 1880 to 1900. Students of Pasteur, Koch, and others discovered in rapid succession a host of bacteria capable of causing specific diseases (pathogens). They also elaborated an extensive arsenal of techniques and laboratory procedures for revealing the ubiquity, diversity, and abilities of microbes.\nProgress in the 20th century\nAll of these developments occurred in Europe. Not until the early 1900s did microbiology become established in America. Many microbiologists who worked in America at this time had studied either under Koch or at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Once established in America, microbiology flourished, especially with regard to such related disciplines as biochemistry and genetics. In 1923 American bacteriologist David Bergey established that science’s primary reference, updated editions of which continue to be used today.\nSince the 1940s microbiology has experienced an extremely productive period during which many disease-causing microbes have been identified and methods to control them developed. Microorganisms have also been effectively utilized in industry; their activities have been channeled to the extent that valuable products are now both vital and commonplace.\nThe study of microorganisms has also advanced the knowledge of all living things. Microbes are easy to work with and thus provide a simple vehicle for studying the complex processes of life; as such they have become a powerful tool for studies in genetics and metabolism at the molecular level. This intensive probing into the functions of microbes has resulted in numerous and often unexpected dividends. Knowledge of the basic metabolism and nutritional requirements of a pathogen, for example, often leads to a means of controlling disease or infection.",

The methods used to study and manipulate these minute and mostly unicellular organisms differ from those used in most other biological investigations. Recombinant DNA technology uses microorganisms, particularly bacteria and viruses, to amplify DNA sequences and generate the encoded products. Moving genes from one microorganism to another, or amplifying them within microorganisms, permits application of microbial skills to solve medical and environmental problems. Many microorganisms are unique among living things in their ability to use gaseous nitrogen from the air for their nutritional requirements, or to degrade complex macromolecules in such materials as wood. By rearranging the genes that control these and other processes, scientists seek to engineer microorganisms that will process wastes, fertilize agricultural land, produce desirable biomolecules, and solve other problems inexpensively and safely.\nMicrobiologists pursue careers in many fields, including agricultural, environmental, food, and industrial microbiology; public health; resource management; basic research; education; and pharmaceuticals.

Microbiology studies the systematics, morphology, physiology, biochemistry, evolution, ecological roles, and practical uses of microorganisms. Medical microbiology is also part of microbiology.\nDifferent parts of microbiology can be classified into pure and applied sciences. Microbiology can be also classified by taxonomy, as in the cases of bacteriology, mycology, protozoology, and phycology. There is considerable overlap of the specific branches of microbiology with each other and with other disciplines. Certain aspects of these branches can extend beyond the traditional scope of microbiology\nHistory\n[change | change source]In 1665, Robert Hooke saw that cork was made up of little cubes that he named cells. Later Anton van Leeuwenhoek made the important connection that cells are living things when he saw through his early microscope smallest one-celled organisms. Later Christian Ehrenberg found that protista or bacteria were different kinds of cells. In the late part of the 1800s Martinus Beijerinck showed that there were small particles called viruses.\nAnother important change in the study of microorganisms came from the discovery of DNA and RNA. This allowed using a vector to change the inside of a cell without killing it. One recent discovery that changed the study of microbiology is the discovery of transposons or jumping genes.

          "content": "Industrial microbiology\nIndustrial microbiology is a branch of biotechnology that applies microbial sciences to create industrial products in mass quantities, often using microbial cell factories. There are multiple ways to manipulate a microorganism in order to increase maximum product yields. Introduction of mutations into an organism may be accomplished by introducing them to mutagens. Another way to increase production is by gene amplification, this is done by the use of plasmids, and vectors. The plasmids and/ or vectors are used to incorporate multiple copies of a specific gene that would allow more enzymes to be produced that eventually cause more product yield.[1] The manipulation of organisms in order to yield a specific product has many applications to the real world like the production of some antibiotics, vitamins, enzymes, amino acids, solvents, alcohol and daily products. Microorganisms play a big role in the industry, with multiple ways to be used. Medicinally, microbes can be used for creating antibiotics in order to treat infection. Microbes can also be used for the food industry as well. Microbes are very useful in creating some of the mass produced products that are consumed by people. The chemical industry also uses microorganisms in order to synthesize amino acids and organic solvents. Microbes can also be used in an agricultural application for use as a biopesticide instead of using dangerous chemicals and or inoculants to help plant proliferation.\nMedical application\n[edit]The medical application to industrial microbiology is the production of new drugs synthesized in a specific organism for medical purposes. Production of antibiotics is necessary for the treatment of many bacterial infections. Some natural occurring antibiotics and precursors, are produced through a process called fermentation. The microorganisms grow in a liquid media where the population size is controlled in order to yield the greatest amount of product. In this environment nutrient, pH, temperature, and oxygen are controlled also in order to maximize the amount of cells and cause them not to die before the production of the antibiotic of interest. Once the antibiotic is produced it must be extracted in order to yield an income.\nVitamins also get produced in massive quantities either by fermentation or biotransformation.[2] Vitamin B 2 (riboflavin) for example is produced both ways. Biotransformation is mostly used for the production of riboflavin, and the carbon source starting material for this reaction is glucose. There are a few strains of microorganisms that were engineered to increase the yield of riboflavin produced. The most common organism used for this reaction is Ashbya gossypii. The fermentation process is another common way to produce riboflavin. The most common organism used for production of riboflavin through fermentation is Eremothecium ashbyii. Once riboflavin is produced it must be extracted from the broth, this is done by heating the cells for a certain amount of time, and then the cells can be filtered out of solution. Riboflavin is later purified and released as final product.[3]\nMicrobial biotransformation can be used to produce steroid medicaments. Steroids can be consumed either orally or by injection. Steroids play a big role in the control of arthritis. Cortisone is an anti-inflammatory drug that fights against arthritis, as well as several skin diseases.[citation needed] Another steroid used is testosterone, which was produced from dehydroepiandrosterone by using the Corynebacterium species[4].\nFood industry application\n[edit]Fermentation\n[edit]Fermentation is a reaction where sugar can be converted into a gas, alcohols or acids. Fermentation happens anaerobically, which means microorganisms that go through fermentation can function without the presence of oxygen. Yeasts and bacteria are commonly used to mass produce multiple products. Drinking alcohol is a product that is produced by yeasts and bacteria. Alcohol that can be consumed is also known as ethanol, and ethanol is used to power automobiles as a fuel source. Drinking alcohol is produced from natural sugars like glucose. Carbon dioxide is produced as a side product in this reaction and can be used to make bread, and can also be used to carbonate beverages. Fermentation Wine: Alcoholic beverages like beer and wine are fermented by microorganisms when there is no oxygen present.[citation needed]\nIn this process, once there is enough alcohol and carbon dioxide around in the media the yeast start to die due to the environment becoming toxic to them. There are many strains of yeast and bacteria that can tolerate different amounts of alcohol around in their environment before it becoming toxic, thus one can obtain different alcohol levels in beer and wine, just by selecting a different microbial strain. Most yeast can tolerate between 10 and 15 percent alcohol, but there are some strains that can tolerate up to 21 percent alcohol. Dairy products like cheese and yogurt can also be made through fermentation using microbes. Cheese was produced as a way to preserve the nutrients obtained from milk, through fermentation thus elongating the shelf-life of the product. Microbes are used to convert the lactose sugars into lactic acid through fermentation. The bacteria used for such fermentation are usually from Lactococci, Lactobacilli, or Streptococci families. Sometimes these microbes are added before or after the acidification step needed for cheese production. Also these microbes are responsible for the different flavors of cheese, since they have enzymes that breakdown milk sugars and fats into multiple building blocks. Some other microbes like mold may be purposely introduced during or before the aging of the cheese, in order to give it a different flavor.[citation needed]\nThe production of yogurt starts from the pasteurization of milk, where undesired microbes are reduced or eliminated. Once the milk is pasteurized the milk is ready to be processed to reduce fat and liquid content, so what remains is mostly solid content. This can be done by drying the milk so that the liquid evaporates or by adding concentrated milk. Increasing the solid content of the milk also increases the nutritional value since the nutrients are more concentrated. After this step is accomplished, the milk is ready for fermentation where the milk gets inoculated with bacteria in hygienic stainless steel containers and then gets carefully monitored for lactic acid production, temperature and pH.[citation needed]\nEnzymes can be produced through fermentation either by submerged fermentation and/ or by solid state fermentation.[5] Submerged fermentation is referred to when the microorganisms are in contact with media. In this process the contact with oxygen is essential. The bioreactors/fermentors that are used to do these mass production of product can store up to 500 cubic meters in volume. Solid state fermentation is less common than submerged fermentation, but has many benefits. There is less need for the environment to be sterile since there is less water, there is a higher stability and concentration for the end product.[5] Insulin synthesis is done through the fermentation process and the use of recombinant E.coli or yeast in order to make human insulin also called Humulin.\nAgriculture application\n[edit]The demand for agricultural products is constantly increasing due to the need of various fertilizers and pesticides. There are long term effects of the overuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Due to the excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, the soil becomes infertile and a non-sufficient use for growing crops. For that matter, biofertelizers, biopesticides and organic farming come to the rescue.\nBiopesticide is a pesticide derived from a living organism or natural occurring substances. Biochemical pesticides can also be produced from naturally occurring substances that can control pest populations in a non-toxic matter.[6] An example of a biochemical pesticide is garlic and pepper based insecticides, these work by repelling insects from the desired location. Microbial pesticides, usually a virus, bacterium, or fungus are used to control pest populations in a more specific manner.[6] The most commonly used microbe for the production of microbial bio-pesticides is Bacillus thuringiensis, also known as Bt. This spore forming bacterium produces a delta-endotoxins in which it causes the insect or pest to stop feeding on the crop or plant because the endotoxin destroys the lining of the digestive system.\nChemical application\n[edit]Synthesis of amino acids and organic solvents can also be made using microbes. The synthesis of essential amino acids such as are L-Methionine, L-Lysine, L-Tryptophan and the non-essential amino acid L-Glutamic acid are used today mainly for feed, food, and pharmaceutical industries. The production of these amino acids is due to Corynebacterium glutamicum and fermentation. C.glutamicum was engineered to be able to produce L-lysine and L-Glutamic acid in large quantities.[7] L-Glutamic acid had a high demand for production because this amino acid is used to produce Monosodium glutamate (MSG) a food flavoring agent. In 2012 the total production of L-Glutamic acid was 2.2 million tons and is produced using a submerged fermentation technique inoculated with C.glutamicum. L-Lysine was originally produced from diaminopimelic acid (DAP) by E.coli, but once the C.glutamicum was discovered for the production of L-Glutamic acid.[7] This organism and other autotrophs were later modified to yield other amino acids such as lysine, aspartate, methionine, isoleucine and threonine.[7] L-Lysine is used for the feeding of pigs and chicken, as well as to treat nutrient deficiency, increase energy in a patient, and sometimes used to treat viral infections. L-Tryptophan is also produced through fermentation and by Corynebacterium and E.coli, though the production is not as large as the rest of the amino acids it is still produced for pharmaceutical purposes since it can be converted and used to produce neurotransmitters.[7]\nThe production of organic solvents like acetone, butanol, and isopropanol through fermentation was one of the first things to be produced by using bacteria, since achieving the necessary chirality of the products is easily achieved by using living systems.[8] Solvent fermentation uses a series of Clostridia bacterial species. Solvent fermentation at first was not as productive as it is used today. The amount of bacteria required to yield a product was high, and the actual yield of product was low. Later technological advances were discovered that allowed scientist to genetically alter these strains to achieve a higher yield for these solvents. These Clostridial strains were transformed to have extra gene copies of enzymes necessary for solvent production, as well as being more tolerant to higher concentrations of the solvent being produced, since these bacteria have a range of product in which they can survive in before the environment becomes toxic.[9] Yielding more strains that can use other substrates was also another way to increase the productivity of these bacteria.[9]\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ \"Industrial Production of Antibiotics [in: Section - Microbial Products in the Health Industry]\".

          "content": "Cryptography\nCryptography, or cryptology (from Ancient Greek: κρυπτός, romanized: kryptós \"hidden, secret\"; and γράφειν graphein, \"to write\", or -λογία -logia, \"study\", respectively[1]), is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior.[2] More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages.[3] Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, information security, electrical engineering, digital signal processing, physics, and others.[4] Core concepts related to information security (data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation) are also central to cryptography.[5] Practical applications of cryptography include electronic commerce, chip-based payment cards, digital currencies, computer passwords, and military communications.\nCryptography prior to the modern age was effectively synonymous with encryption, converting readable information (plaintext) to unintelligible nonsense text (ciphertext), which can only be read by reversing the process (decryption). The sender of an encrypted (coded) message shares the decryption (decoding) technique only with the intended recipients to preclude access from adversaries. The cryptography literature often uses the names \"Alice\" (or \"A\") for the sender, \"Bob\" (or \"B\") for the intended recipient, and \"Eve\" (or \"E\") for the eavesdropping adversary.[6] Since the development of rotor cipher machines in World War I and the advent of computers in World War II, cryptography methods have become increasingly complex and their applications more varied.\nModern cryptography is heavily based on mathematical theory and computer science practice; cryptographic algorithms are designed around computational hardness assumptions, making such algorithms hard to break in actual practice by any adversary. While it is theoretically possible to break into a well-designed system, it is infeasible in actual practice to do so. Such schemes, if well designed, are therefore termed \"computationally secure\". Theoretical advances (e.g., improvements in integer factorization algorithms) and faster computing technology require these designs to be continually reevaluated and, if necessary, adapted. Information-theoretically secure schemes that provably cannot be broken even with unlimited computing power, such as the one-time pad, are much more difficult to use in practice than the best theoretically breakable but computationally secure schemes.\nThe growth of cryptographic technology has raised a number of legal issues in the Information Age. Cryptography's potential for use as a tool for espionage and sedition has led many governments to classify it as a weapon and to limit or even prohibit its use and export.[7] In some jurisdictions where the use of cryptography is legal, laws permit investigators to compel the disclosure of encryption keys for documents relevant to an investigation.[8][9] Cryptography also plays a major role in digital rights management and copyright infringement disputes with regard to digital media.[10]\nTerminology\n[edit]The first use of the term \"cryptograph\" (as opposed to \"cryptogram\") dates back to the 19th century—originating from \"The Gold-Bug\", a story by Edgar Allan Poe.[11][12]\nUntil modern times, cryptography referred almost exclusively to \"encryption\", which is the process of converting ordinary information (called plaintext) into an unintelligible form (called ciphertext).[13] Decryption is the reverse, in other words, moving from the unintelligible ciphertext back to plaintext. A cipher (or cypher) is a pair of algorithms that carry out the encryption and the reversing decryption. The detailed operation of a cipher is controlled both by the algorithm and, in each instance, by a \"key\". The key is a secret (ideally known only to the communicants), usually a string of characters (ideally short so it can be remembered by the user), which is needed to decrypt the ciphertext. In formal mathematical terms, a \"cryptosystem\" is the ordered list of elements of finite possible plaintexts, finite possible cyphertexts, finite possible keys, and the encryption and decryption algorithms that correspond to each key. Keys are important both formally and in actual practice, as ciphers without variable keys can be trivially broken with only the knowledge of the cipher used and are therefore useless (or even counter-productive) for most purposes. Historically, ciphers were often used directly for encryption or decryption without additional procedures such as authentication or integrity checks.\nThere are two main types of cryptosystems: symmetric and asymmetric. In symmetric systems, the only ones known until the 1970s, the same secret key encrypts and decrypts a message. Data manipulation in symmetric systems is significantly faster than in asymmetric systems. Asymmetric systems use a \"public key\" to encrypt a message and a related \"private key\" to decrypt it. The advantage of asymmetric systems is that the public key can be freely published, allowing parties to establish secure communication without having a shared secret key. In practice, asymmetric systems are used to first exchange a secret key, and then secure communication proceeds via a more efficient symmetric system using that key.[14] Examples of asymmetric systems include Diffie–Hellman key exchange, RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman), ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography), and Post-quantum cryptography. Secure symmetric algorithms include the commonly used AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) which replaced the older DES (Data Encryption Standard).[15] Insecure symmetric algorithms include children's language tangling schemes such as Pig Latin or other cant, and all historical cryptographic schemes, however seriously intended, prior to the invention of the one-time pad early in the 20th century.\nIn colloquial use, the term \"code\" is often used to mean any method of encryption or concealment of meaning. However, in cryptography, code has a more specific meaning: the replacement of a unit of plaintext (i.e., a meaningful word or phrase) with a code word (for example, \"wallaby\" replaces \"attack at dawn\"). A cypher, in contrast, is a scheme for changing or substituting an element below such a level (a letter, a syllable, or a pair of letters, etc.) to produce a cyphertext.\nCryptanalysis is the term used for the study of methods for obtaining the meaning of encrypted information without access to the key normally required to do so; i.e., it is the study of how to \"crack\" encryption algorithms or their implementations.\nSome use the terms \"cryptography\" and \"cryptology\" interchangeably in English,[16] while others (including US military practice generally) use \"cryptography\" to refer specifically to the use and practice of cryptographic techniques and \"cryptology\" to refer to the combined study of cryptography and cryptanalysis.[17][18] English is more flexible than several other languages in which \"cryptology\" (done by cryptologists) is always used in the second sense above. RFC 2828 advises that steganography is sometimes included in cryptology.[19]\nThe study of characteristics of languages that have some application in cryptography or cryptology (e.g. frequency data, letter combinations, universal patterns, etc.) is called cryptolinguistics. Cryptolingusitics is especially used in military intelligence applications for deciphering foreign communications.[20][21]\nHistory\n[edit]Before the modern era, cryptography focused on message confidentiality (i.e., encryption)—conversion of messages from a comprehensible form into an incomprehensible one and back again at the other end, rendering it unreadable by interceptors or eavesdroppers without secret knowledge (namely the key needed for decryption of that message). Encryption attempted to ensure secrecy in communications, such as those of spies, military leaders, and diplomats. In recent decades, the field has expanded beyond confidentiality concerns to include techniques for message integrity checking, sender/receiver identity authentication, digital signatures, interactive proofs and secure computation, among others.\nClassic cryptography\n[edit]The main classical cipher types are transposition ciphers, which rearrange the order of letters in a message (e.g., 'hello world' becomes 'ehlol owrdl' in a trivially simple rearrangement scheme), and substitution ciphers, which systematically replace letters or groups of letters with other letters or groups of letters (e.g., 'fly at once' becomes 'gmz bu podf' by replacing each letter with the one following it in the Latin alphabet).[22] Simple versions of either have never offered much confidentiality from enterprising opponents. An early substitution cipher was the Caesar cipher, in which each letter in the plaintext was replaced by a letter three positions further down the alphabet.[23] Suetonius reports that Julius Caesar used it with a shift of three to communicate with his generals. Atbash is an example of an early Hebrew cipher. The earliest known use of cryptography is some carved ciphertext on stone in Egypt (c. 1900 BCE), but this may have been done for the amusement of literate observers rather than as a way of concealing information.\nThe Greeks of Classical times are said to have known of ciphers (e.g., the scytale transposition cipher claimed to have been used by the Spartan military).[24] Steganography (i.e., hiding even the existence of a message so as to keep it confidential) was also first developed in ancient times. An early example, from Herodotus, was a message tattooed on a slave's shaved head and concealed under the regrown hair.[13] Other steganography methods involve 'hiding in plain sight,' such as using a music cipher to disguise an encrypted message within a regular piece of sheet music. More modern examples of steganography include the use of invisible ink, microdots, and digital watermarks to conceal information.\nIn India, the 2000-year-old Kama Sutra of Vātsyāyana speaks of two different kinds of ciphers called Kautiliyam and Mulavediya. In the Kautiliyam, the cipher letter substitutions are based on phonetic relations, such as vowels becoming consonants. In the Mulavediya, the cipher alphabet consists of pairing letters and using the reciprocal ones.[13]\nIn Sassanid Persia, there were two secret scripts, according to the Muslim author Ibn al-Nadim: the šāh-dabīrīya (literally \"King's script\") which was used for official correspondence, and the rāz-saharīya which was used to communicate secret messages with other countries.[25]\nDavid Kahn notes in The Codebreakers that modern cryptology originated among the Arabs, the first people to systematically document cryptanalytic methods.[26] Al-Khalil (717–786) wrote the Book of Cryptographic Messages, which contains the first use of permutations and combinations to list all possible Arabic words with and without vowels.[27]\nCiphertexts produced by a classical cipher (and some modern ciphers) will reveal statistical information about the plaintext, and that information can often be used to break the cipher. After the discovery of frequency analysis, nearly all such ciphers could be broken by an informed attacker.[28] Such classical ciphers still enjoy popularity today, though mostly as puzzles (see cryptogram). The Arab mathematician and polymath Al-Kindi wrote a book on cryptography entitled Risalah fi Istikhraj al-Mu'amma (Manuscript for the Deciphering Cryptographic Messages), which described the first known use of frequency analysis cryptanalysis techniques.[29][30]\nLanguage letter frequencies may offer little help for some extended historical encryption techniques such as homophonic cipher that tend to flatten the frequency distribution. For those ciphers, language letter group (or n-gram) frequencies may provide an attack.\nEssentially all ciphers remained vulnerable to cryptanalysis using the frequency analysis technique until the development of the polyalphabetic cipher, most clearly by Leon Battista Alberti around the year 1467, though there is some indication that it was already known to Al-Kindi.[30] Alberti's innovation was to use different ciphers (i.e., substitution alphabets) for various parts of a message (perhaps for each successive plaintext letter at the limit). He also invented what was probably the first automatic cipher device, a wheel that implemented a partial realization of his invention. In the Vigenère cipher, a polyalphabetic cipher, encryption uses a key word, which controls letter substitution depending on which letter of the key word is used. In the mid-19th century Charles Babbage showed that the Vigenère cipher was vulnerable to Kasiski examination, but this was first published about ten years later by Friedrich Kasiski.[31]\nAlthough frequency analysis can be a powerful and general technique against many ciphers, encryption has still often been effective in practice, as many a would-be cryptanalyst was unaware of the technique. Breaking a message without using frequency analysis essentially required knowledge of the cipher used and perhaps of the key involved, thus making espionage, bribery, burglary, defection, etc., more attractive approaches to the cryptanalytically uninformed. It was finally explicitly recognized in the 19th century that secrecy of a cipher's algorithm is not a sensible nor practical safeguard of message security; in fact, it was further realized that any adequate cryptographic scheme (including ciphers) should remain secure even if the adversary fully understands the cipher algorithm itself. Security of the key used should alone be sufficient for a good cipher to maintain confidentiality under an attack. This fundamental principle was first explicitly stated in 1883 by Auguste Kerckhoffs and is generally called Kerckhoffs's Principle; alternatively and more bluntly, it was restated by Claude Shannon, the inventor of information theory and the fundamentals of theoretical cryptography, as Shannon's Maxim—'the enemy knows the system'.\nDifferent physical devices and aids have been used to assist with ciphers. One of the earliest may have been the scytale of ancient Greece, a rod supposedly used by the Spartans as an aid for a transposition cipher. In medieval times, other aids were invented such as the cipher grille, which was also used for a kind of steganography. With the invention of polyalphabetic ciphers came more sophisticated aids such as Alberti's own cipher disk, Johannes Trithemius' tabula recta scheme, and Thomas Jefferson's wheel cypher (not publicly known, and reinvented independently by Bazeries around 1900). Many mechanical encryption/decryption devices were invented early in the 20th century, and several patented, among them rotor machines—famously including the Enigma machine used by the German government and military from the late 1920s and during World War II.[32] The ciphers implemented by better quality examples of these machine designs brought about a substantial increase in cryptanalytic difficulty after WWI.[33]\nEarly computer-era cryptography\n[edit]Cryptanalysis of the new mechanical ciphering devices proved to be both difficult and laborious. In the United Kingdom, cryptanalytic efforts at Bletchley Park during WWII spurred the development of more efficient means for carrying out repetitive tasks, such as military code breaking (decryption). This culminated in the development of the Colossus, the world's first fully electronic, digital, programmable computer, which assisted in the decryption of ciphers generated by the German Army's Lorenz SZ40/42 machine.\nExtensive open academic research into cryptography is relatively recent, beginning in the mid-1970s. In the early 1970s IBM personnel designed the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm that became the first federal government cryptography standard in the United States.[34] In 1976 Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman published the Diffie–Hellman key exchange algorithm.[35] In 1977 the RSA algorithm was published in Martin Gardner's Scientific American column.[36] Since then, cryptography has become a widely used tool in communications, computer networks, and computer security generally.\nSome modern cryptographic techniques can only keep their keys secret if certain mathematical problems are intractable, such as the integer factorization or the discrete logarithm problems, so there are deep connections with abstract mathematics. There are very few cryptosystems that are proven to be unconditionally secure. The one-time pad is one, and was proven to be so by Claude Shannon. There are a few important algorithms that have been proven secure under certain assumptions. For example, the infeasibility of factoring extremely large integers is the basis for believing that RSA is secure, and some other systems, but even so, proof of unbreakability is unavailable since the underlying mathematical problem remains open. In practice, these are widely used, and are believed unbreakable in practice by most competent observers. There are systems similar to RSA, such as one by Michael O. Rabin that are provably secure provided factoring n = pq is impossible; it is quite unusable in practice. The discrete logarithm problem is the basis for believing some other cryptosystems are secure, and again, there are related, less practical systems that are provably secure relative to the solvability or insolvability discrete log problem.[37]\nAs well as being aware of cryptographic history, cryptographic algorithm and system designers must also sensibly consider probable future developments while working on their designs. For instance, continuous improvements in computer processing power have increased the scope of brute-force attacks, so when specifying key lengths, the required key lengths are similarly advancing.[38] The potential impact of quantum computing are already being considered by some cryptographic system designers developing post-quantum cryptography.[when?] The announced imminence of small implementations of these machines may be making the need for preemptive caution rather more than merely speculative.[5]\nModern cryptography\n[edit]Claude Shannon's two papers, his 1948 paper on information theory, and especially his 1949 paper on cryptography, laid the foundations of modern cryptography and provided a mathematical basis for future cryptography.[39][40] His 1949 paper has been noted as having provided a \"solid theoretical basis for cryptography and for cryptanalysis\",[41] and as having turned cryptography from an \"art to a science\".[42] As a result of his contributions and work, he has been described as the \"founding father of modern cryptography\".[43]\nPrior to the early 20th century, cryptography was mainly concerned with linguistic and lexicographic patterns. Since then cryptography has broadened in scope, and now makes extensive use of mathematical subdisciplines, including information theory, computational complexity, statistics, combinatorics, abstract algebra, number theory, and finite mathematics.[44] Cryptography is also a branch of engineering, but an unusual one since it deals with active, intelligent, and malevolent opposition; other kinds of engineering (e.g., civil or chemical engineering) need deal only with neutral natural forces. There is also active research examining the relationship between cryptographic problems and quantum physics.\nJust as the development of digital computers and electronics helped in cryptanalysis, it made possible much more complex ciphers. Furthermore, computers allowed for the encryption of any kind of data representable in any binary format, unlike classical ciphers which only encrypted written language texts; this was new and significant. Computer use has thus supplanted linguistic cryptography, both for cipher design and cryptanalysis. Many computer ciphers can be characterized by their operation on binary bit sequences (sometimes in groups or blocks), unlike classical and mechanical schemes, which generally manipulate traditional characters (i.e., letters and digits) directly. However, computers have also assisted cryptanalysis, which has compensated to some extent for increased cipher complexity. Nonetheless, good modern ciphers have stayed ahead of cryptanalysis; it is typically the case that use of a quality cipher is very efficient (i.e., fast and requiring few resources, such as memory or CPU capability), while breaking it requires an effort many orders of magnitude larger, and vastly larger than that required for any classical cipher, making cryptanalysis so inefficient and impractical as to be effectively impossible.\nSymmetric-key cryptography\n[edit]Symmetric-key cryptography refers to encryption methods in which both the sender and receiver share the same key (or, less commonly, in which their keys are different, but related in an easily computable way). This was the only kind of encryption publicly known until June 1976.[35]\nSymmetric key ciphers are implemented as either block ciphers or stream ciphers. A block cipher enciphers input in blocks of plaintext as opposed to individual characters, the input form used by a stream cipher.\nThe Data Encryption Standard (DES) and the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) are block cipher designs that have been designated cryptography standards by the US government (though DES's designation was finally withdrawn after the AES was adopted).[45] Despite its deprecation as an official standard, DES (especially its still-approved and much more secure triple-DES variant) remains quite popular; it is used across a wide range of applications, from ATM encryption[46] to e-mail privacy[47] and secure remote access.[48] Many other block ciphers have been designed and released, with considerable variation in quality. Many, even some designed by capable practitioners, have been thoroughly broken, such as FEAL.[5][49]\nStream ciphers, in contrast to the 'block' type, create an arbitrarily long stream of key material, which is combined with the plaintext bit-by-bit or character-by-character, somewhat like the one-time pad. In a stream cipher, the output stream is created based on a hidden internal state that changes as the cipher operates. That internal state is initially set up using the secret key material. RC4 is a widely used stream cipher.[5] Block ciphers can be used as stream ciphers by generating blocks of a keystream (in place of a Pseudorandom number generator) and applying an XOR operation to each bit of the plaintext with each bit of the keystream.[50]\nMessage authentication codes (MACs) are much like cryptographic hash functions, except that a secret key can be used to authenticate the hash value upon receipt;[5][51] this additional complication blocks an attack scheme against bare digest algorithms, and so has been thought worth the effort. Cryptographic hash functions are a third type of cryptographic algorithm. They take a message of any length as input, and output a short, fixed-length hash, which can be used in (for example) a digital signature. For good hash functions, an attacker cannot find two messages that produce the same hash. MD4 is a long-used hash function that is now broken; MD5, a strengthened variant of MD4, is also widely used but broken in practice. The US National Security Agency developed the Secure Hash Algorithm series of MD5-like hash functions: SHA-0 was a flawed algorithm that the agency withdrew; SHA-1 is widely deployed and more secure than MD5, but cryptanalysts have identified attacks against it; the SHA-2 family improves on SHA-1, but is vulnerable to clashes as of 2011; and the US standards authority thought it \"prudent\" from a security perspective to develop a new standard to \"significantly improve the robustness of NIST's overall hash algorithm toolkit.\"[52] Thus, a hash function design competition was meant to select a new U.S. national standard, to be called SHA-3, by 2012. The competition ended on October 2, 2012, when the NIST announced that Keccak would be the new SHA-3 hash algorithm.[53] Unlike block and stream ciphers that are invertible, cryptographic hash functions produce a hashed output that cannot be used to retrieve the original input data. Cryptographic hash functions are used to verify the authenticity of data retrieved from an untrusted source or to add a layer of security.\nPublic-key cryptography\n[edit]Symmetric-key cryptosystems use the same key for encryption and decryption of a message, although a message or group of messages can have a different key than others. A significant disadvantage of symmetric ciphers is the key management necessary to use them securely. Each distinct pair of communicating parties must, ideally, share a different key, and perhaps for each ciphertext exchanged as well. The number of keys required increases as the square of the number of network members, which very quickly requires complex key management schemes to keep them all consistent and secret.\nIn a groundbreaking 1976 paper, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman proposed the notion of public-key (also, more generally, called asymmetric key) cryptography in which two different but mathematically related keys are used—a public key and a private key.[54] A public key system is so constructed that calculation of one key (the 'private key') is computationally infeasible from the other (the 'public key'), even though they are necessarily related. Instead, both keys are generated secretly, as an interrelated pair.[55] The historian David Kahn described public-key cryptography as \"the most revolutionary new concept in the field since polyalphabetic substitution emerged in the Renaissance\".[56]\nIn public-key cryptosystems, the public key may be freely distributed, while its paired private key must remain secret. In a public-key encryption system, the public key is used for encryption, while the private or secret key is used for decryption. While Diffie and Hellman could not find such a system, they showed that public-key cryptography was indeed possible by presenting the Diffie–Hellman key exchange protocol, a solution that is now widely used in secure communications to allow two parties to secretly agree on a shared encryption key.[35] The X.509 standard defines the most commonly used format for public key certificates.[57]\nDiffie and Hellman's publication sparked widespread academic efforts in finding a practical public-key encryption system. This race was finally won in 1978 by Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Len Adleman, whose solution has since become known as the RSA algorithm.[58]\nThe Diffie–Hellman and RSA algorithms, in addition to being the first publicly known examples of high-quality public-key algorithms, have been among the most widely used. Other asymmetric-key algorithms include the Cramer–Shoup cryptosystem, ElGamal encryption, and various elliptic curve techniques.\nA document published in 1997 by the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), a British intelligence organization, revealed that cryptographers at GCHQ had anticipated several academic developments.[59] Reportedly, around 1970, James H. Ellis had conceived the principles of asymmetric key cryptography. In 1973, Clifford Cocks invented a solution that was very similar in design rationale to RSA.[59][60] In 1974, Malcolm J. Williamson is claimed to have developed the Diffie–Hellman key exchange.[61]\nPublic-key cryptography is also used for implementing digital signature schemes. A digital signature is reminiscent of an ordinary signature; they both have the characteristic of being easy for a user to produce, but difficult for anyone else to forge. Digital signatures can also be permanently tied to the content of the message being signed; they cannot then be 'moved' from one document to another, for any attempt will be detectable. In digital signature schemes, there are two algorithms: one for signing, in which a secret key is used to process the message (or a hash of the message, or both), and one for verification, in which the matching public key is used with the message to check the validity of the signature. RSA and DSA are two of the most popular digital signature schemes. Digital signatures are central to the operation of public key infrastructures and many network security schemes (e.g., SSL/TLS, many VPNs, etc.).[49]\nPublic-key algorithms are most often based on the computational complexity of \"hard\" problems, often from number theory. For example, the hardness of RSA is related to the integer factorization problem, while Diffie–Hellman and DSA are related to the discrete logarithm problem. The security of elliptic curve cryptography is based on number theoretic problems involving elliptic curves. Because of the difficulty of the underlying problems, most public-key algorithms involve operations such as modular multiplication and exponentiation, which are much more computationally expensive than the techniques used in most block ciphers, especially with typical key sizes. As a result, public-key cryptosystems are commonly hybrid cryptosystems, in which a fast high-quality symmetric-key encryption algorithm is used for the message itself, while the relevant symmetric key is sent with the message, but encrypted using a public-key algorithm. Similarly, hybrid signature schemes are often used, in which a cryptographic hash function is computed, and only the resulting hash is digitally signed.[5]\nCryptographic hash functions\n[edit]Cryptographic hash functions are functions that take a variable-length input and return a fixed-length output, which can be used in, for example, a digital signature. For a hash function to be secure, it must be difficult to compute two inputs that hash to the same value (collision resistance) and to compute an input that hashes to a given output (preimage resistance). MD4 is a long-used hash function that is now broken; MD5, a strengthened variant of MD4, is also widely used but broken in practice. The US National Security Agency developed the Secure Hash Algorithm series of MD5-like hash functions: SHA-0 was a flawed algorithm that the agency withdrew; SHA-1 is widely deployed and more secure than MD5, but cryptanalysts have identified attacks against it; the SHA-2 family improves on SHA-1, but is vulnerable to clashes as of 2011; and the US standards authority thought it \"prudent\" from a security perspective to develop a new standard to \"significantly improve the robustness of NIST's overall hash algorithm toolkit.\"[52] Thus, a hash function design competition was meant to select a new U.S. national standard, to be called SHA-3, by 2012. The competition ended on October 2, 2012, when the NIST announced that Keccak would be the new SHA-3 hash algorithm.[53] Unlike block and stream ciphers that are invertible, cryptographic hash functions produce a hashed output that cannot be used to retrieve the original input data. Cryptographic hash functions are used to verify the authenticity of data retrieved from an untrusted source or to add a layer of security.\nCryptanalysis\n[edit]The goal of cryptanalysis is to find some weakness or insecurity in a cryptographic scheme, thus permitting its subversion or evasion.\nIt is a common misconception that every encryption method can be broken. In connection with his WWII work at Bell Labs, Claude Shannon proved that the one-time pad cipher is unbreakable, provided the key material is truly random, never reused, kept secret from all possible attackers, and of equal or greater length than the message.[62] Most ciphers, apart from the one-time pad, can be broken with enough computational effort by brute force attack, but the amount of effort needed may be exponentially dependent on the key size, as compared to the effort needed to make use of the cipher. In such cases, effective security could be achieved if it is proven that the effort required (i.e., \"work factor\", in Shannon's terms) is beyond the ability of any adversary. This means it must be shown that no efficient method (as opposed to the time-consuming brute force method) can be found to break the cipher. Since no such proof has been found to date, the one-time-pad remains the only theoretically unbreakable cipher. Although well-implemented one-time-pad encryption cannot be broken, traffic analysis is still possible.\nThere are a wide variety of cryptanalytic attacks, and they can be classified in any of several ways. A common distinction turns on what Eve (an attacker) knows and what capabilities are available. In a ciphertext-only attack, Eve has access only to the ciphertext (good modern cryptosystems are usually effectively immune to ciphertext-only attacks). In a known-plaintext attack, Eve has access to a ciphertext and its corresponding plaintext (or to many such pairs). In a chosen-plaintext attack, Eve may choose a plaintext and learn its corresponding ciphertext (perhaps many times); an example is gardening, used by the British during WWII. In a chosen-ciphertext attack, Eve may be able to choose ciphertexts and learn their corresponding plaintexts.[5] Finally in a man-in-the-middle attack Eve gets in between Alice (the sender) and Bob (the recipient), accesses and modifies the traffic and then forward it to the recipient.[63] Also important, often overwhelmingly so, are mistakes (generally in the design or use of one of the protocols involved).\nCryptanalysis of symmetric-key ciphers typically involves looking for attacks against the block ciphers or stream ciphers that are more efficient than any attack that could be against a perfect cipher. For example, a simple brute force attack against DES requires one known plaintext and 255 decryptions, trying approximately half of the possible keys, to reach a point at which chances are better than even that the key sought will have been found. But this may not be enough assurance; a linear cryptanalysis attack against DES requires 243 known plaintexts (with their corresponding ciphertexts) and approximately 243 DES operations.[64] This is a considerable improvement over brute force attacks.\nPublic-key algorithms are based on the computational difficulty of various problems. The most famous of these are the difficulty of integer factorization of semiprimes and the difficulty of calculating discrete logarithms, both of which are not yet proven to be solvable in polynomial time (P) using only a classical Turing-complete computer. Much public-key cryptanalysis concerns designing algorithms in P that can solve these problems, or using other technologies, such as quantum computers. For instance, the best-known algorithms for solving the elliptic curve-based version of discrete logarithm are much more time-consuming than the best-known algorithms for factoring, at least for problems of more or less equivalent size. Thus, to achieve an equivalent strength of encryption, techniques that depend upon the difficulty of factoring large composite numbers, such as the RSA cryptosystem, require larger keys than elliptic curve techniques. For this reason, public-key cryptosystems based on elliptic curves have become popular since their invention in the mid-1990s.\nWhile pure cryptanalysis uses weaknesses in the algorithms themselves, other attacks on cryptosystems are based on actual use of the algorithms in real devices, and are called side-channel attacks. If a cryptanalyst has access to, for example, the amount of time the device took to encrypt a number of plaintexts or report an error in a password or PIN character, they may be able to use a timing attack to break a cipher that is otherwise resistant to analysis. An attacker might also study the pattern and length of messages to derive valuable information; this is known as traffic analysis[65] and can be quite useful to an alert adversary. Poor administration of a cryptosystem, such as permitting too short keys, will make any system vulnerable, regardless of other virtues. Social engineering and other attacks against humans (e.g., bribery, extortion, blackmail, espionage, rubber-hose cryptanalysis or torture) are usually employed due to being more cost-effective and feasible to perform in a reasonable amount of time compared to pure cryptanalysis by a high margin.\nCryptographic primitives\n[edit]Much of the theoretical work in cryptography concerns cryptographic primitives—algorithms with basic cryptographic properties—and their relationship to other cryptographic problems. More complicated cryptographic tools are then built from these basic primitives. These primitives provide fundamental properties, which are used to develop more complex tools called cryptosystems or cryptographic protocols, which guarantee one or more high-level security properties. Note, however, that the distinction between cryptographic primitives and cryptosystems, is quite arbitrary; for example, the RSA algorithm is sometimes considered a cryptosystem, and sometimes a primitive. Typical examples of cryptographic primitives include pseudorandom functions, one-way functions, etc.\nCryptosystems\n[edit]One or more cryptographic primitives are often used to develop a more complex algorithm, called a cryptographic system, or cryptosystem. Cryptosystems (e.g., El-Gamal encryption) are designed to provide particular functionality (e.g., public key encryption) while guaranteeing certain security properties (e.g., chosen-plaintext attack (CPA) security in the random oracle model). Cryptosystems use the properties of the underlying cryptographic primitives to support the system's security properties. As the distinction between primitives and cryptosystems is somewhat arbitrary, a sophisticated cryptosystem can be derived from a combination of several more primitive cryptosystems. In many cases, the cryptosystem's structure involves back and forth communication among two or more parties in space (e.g., between the sender of a secure message and its receiver) or across time (e.g., cryptographically protected backup data). Such cryptosystems are sometimes called cryptographic protocols.\nSome widely known cryptosystems include RSA, Schnorr signature, ElGamal encryption, and Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). More complex cryptosystems include electronic cash[66] systems, signcryption systems, etc. Some more 'theoretical'[clarification needed] cryptosystems include interactive proof systems,[67] (like zero-knowledge proofs)[68] and systems for secret sharing.[69][70]\nLightweight cryptography\n[edit]Lightweight cryptography (LWC) concerns cryptographic algorithms developed for a strictly constrained environment. The growth of Internet of Things (IoT) has spiked research into the development of lightweight algorithms that are better suited for the environment. An IoT environment requires strict constraints on power consumption, processing power, and security.[71] Algorithms such as PRESENT, AES, and SPECK are examples of the many LWC algorithms that have been developed to achieve the standard set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.[72]\nApplications\n[edit]Cryptography is widely used on the internet to help protect user-data and prevent eavesdropping. To ensure secrecy during transmission, many systems use private key cryptography to protect transmitted information. With public-key systems, one can maintain secrecy without a master key or a large number of keys.[73] But, some algorithms like BitLocker and VeraCrypt are generally not private-public key cryptography. For example, Veracrypt uses a password hash to generate the single private key. However, it can be configured to run in public-private key systems. The C++ opensource encryption library OpenSSL provides free and opensource encryption software and tools. The most commonly used encryption cipher suit is AES,[74] as it has hardware acceleration for all x86 based processors that has AES-NI. A close contender is ChaCha20-Poly1305, which is a stream cipher, however it is commonly used for mobile devices as they are ARM based which does not feature AES-NI instruction set extension.\nCybersecurity\n[edit]Cryptography can be used to secure communications by encrypting them. Websites use encryption via HTTPS.[75] \"End-to-end\" encryption, where only sender and receiver can read messages, is implemented for email in Pretty Good Privacy and for secure messaging in general in WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram.[75]\nOperating systems use encryption to keep passwords secret, conceal parts of the system, and ensure that software updates are truly from the system maker.[75] Instead of storing plaintext passwords, computer systems store hashes thereof; then, when a user logs in, the system passes the given password through a cryptographic hash function and compares it to the hashed value on file. In this manner, neither the system nor an attacker has at any point access to the password in plaintext.[75]\nEncryption is sometimes used to encrypt one's entire drive. For example, University College London has implemented BitLocker (a program by Microsoft) to render drive data opaque without users logging in.[75]\nCryptocurrencies and cryptoeconomics\n[edit]Cryptographic techniques enable cryptocurrency technologies, such as distributed ledger technologies (e.g., blockchains), which finance cryptoeconomics applications such as decentralized finance (DeFi). Key cryptographic techniques that enable cryptocurrencies and cryptoeconomics include, but are not limited to: cryptographic keys, cryptographic hash function, asymmetric (public key) encryption, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), End-to-End Encryption (E2EE), and Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP).\nLegal issues\n[edit]Prohibitions\n[edit]Cryptography has long been of interest to intelligence gathering and law enforcement agencies.[9] Secret communications may be criminal or even treasonous.[citation needed] Because of its facilitation of privacy, and the diminution of privacy attendant on its prohibition, cryptography is also of considerable interest to civil rights supporters. Accordingly, there has been a history of controversial legal issues surrounding cryptography, especially since the advent of inexpensive computers has made widespread access to high-quality cryptography possible.\nIn some countries, even the domestic use of cryptography is, or has been, restricted. Until 1999, France significantly restricted the use of cryptography domestically, though it has since relaxed many of these rules. In China and Iran, a license is still required to use cryptography.[7] Many countries have tight restrictions on the use of cryptography. Among the more restrictive are laws in Belarus, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Pakistan, Singapore, Tunisia, and Vietnam.[76]\nIn the United States, cryptography is legal for domestic use, but there has been much conflict over legal issues related to cryptography.[9] One particularly important issue has been the export of cryptography and cryptographic software and hardware. Probably because of the importance of cryptanalysis in World War II and an expectation that cryptography would continue to be important for national security, many Western governments have, at some point, strictly regulated export of cryptography. After World War II, it was illegal in the US to sell or distribute encryption technology overseas; in fact, encryption was designated as auxiliary military equipment and put on the United States Munitions List.[77] Until the development of the personal computer, asymmetric key algorithms (i.e., public key techniques), and the Internet, this was not especially problematic. However, as the Internet grew and computers became more widely available, high-quality encryption techniques became well known around the globe.\nExport controls\n[edit]In the 1990s, there were several challenges to US export regulation of cryptography. After the source code for Philip Zimmermann's Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) encryption program found its way onto the Internet in June 1991, a complaint by RSA Security (then called RSA Data Security, Inc.) resulted in a lengthy criminal investigation of Zimmermann by the US Customs Service and the FBI, though no charges were ever filed.[78][79] Daniel J. Bernstein, then a graduate student at UC Berkeley, brought a lawsuit against the US government challenging some aspects of the restrictions based on free speech grounds. The 1995 case Bernstein v. United States ultimately resulted in a 1999 decision that printed source code for cryptographic algorithms and systems was protected as free speech by the United States Constitution.[80]\nIn 1996, thirty-nine countries signed the Wassenaar Arrangement, an arms control treaty that deals with the export of arms and \"dual-use\" technologies such as cryptography. The treaty stipulated that the use of cryptography with short key-lengths (56-bit for symmetric encryption, 512-bit for RSA) would no longer be export-controlled.[81] Cryptography exports from the US became less strictly regulated as a consequence of a major relaxation in 2000;[82] there are no longer very many restrictions on key sizes in US-exported mass-market software. Since this relaxation in US export restrictions, and because most personal computers connected to the Internet include US-sourced web browsers such as Firefox or Internet Explorer, almost every Internet user worldwide has potential access to quality cryptography via their browsers (e.g., via Transport Layer Security). The Mozilla Thunderbird and Microsoft Outlook E-mail client programs similarly can transmit and receive emails via TLS, and can send and receive email encrypted with S/MIME. Many Internet users do not realize that their basic application software contains such extensive cryptosystems. These browsers and email programs are so ubiquitous that even governments whose intent is to regulate civilian use of cryptography generally do not find it practical to do much to control distribution or use of cryptography of this quality, so even when such laws are in force, actual enforcement is often effectively impossible.[citation needed]\nNSA involvement\n[edit]Another contentious issue connected to cryptography in the United States is the influence of the National Security Agency on cipher development and policy.[9] The NSA was involved with the design of DES during its development at IBM and its consideration by the National Bureau of Standards as a possible Federal Standard for cryptography.[83] DES was designed to be resistant to differential cryptanalysis,[84] a powerful and general cryptanalytic technique known to the NSA and IBM, that became publicly known only when it was rediscovered in the late 1980s.[85] According to Steven Levy, IBM discovered differential cryptanalysis,[79] but kept the technique secret at the NSA's request. The technique became publicly known only when Biham and Shamir re-discovered and announced it some years later. The entire affair illustrates the difficulty of determining what resources and knowledge an attacker might actually have.\nAnother instance of the NSA's involvement was the 1993 Clipper chip affair, an encryption microchip intended to be part of the Capstone cryptography-control initiative. Clipper was widely criticized by cryptographers for two reasons. The cipher algorithm (called Skipjack) was then classified (declassified in 1998, long after the Clipper initiative lapsed). The classified cipher caused concerns that the NSA had deliberately made the cipher weak to assist its intelligence efforts. The whole initiative was also criticized based on its violation of Kerckhoffs's Principle, as the scheme included a special escrow key held by the government for use by law enforcement (i.e. wiretapping).[79]\nDigital rights management\n[edit]Cryptography is central to digital rights management (DRM), a group of techniques for technologically controlling use of copyrighted material, being widely implemented and deployed at the behest of some copyright holders. In 1998, U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which criminalized all production, dissemination, and use of certain cryptanalytic techniques and technology (now known or later discovered); specifically, those that could be used to circumvent DRM technological schemes.[86] This had a noticeable impact on the cryptography research community since an argument can be made that any cryptanalytic research violated the DMCA. Similar statutes have since been enacted in several countries and regions, including the implementation in the EU Copyright Directive. Similar restrictions are called for by treaties signed by World Intellectual Property Organization member-states.\nThe United States Department of Justice and FBI have not enforced the DMCA as rigorously as had been feared by some, but the law, nonetheless, remains a controversial one. Niels Ferguson, a well-respected cryptography researcher, has publicly stated that he will not release some of his research into an Intel security design for fear of prosecution under the DMCA.[87] Cryptologist Bruce Schneier has argued that the DMCA encourages vendor lock-in, while inhibiting actual measures toward cyber-security.[88] Both Alan Cox (longtime Linux kernel developer) and Edward Felten (and some of his students at Princeton) have encountered problems related to the Act. Dmitry Sklyarov was arrested during a visit to the US from Russia, and jailed for five months pending trial for alleged violations of the DMCA arising from work he had done in Russia, where the work was legal. In 2007, the cryptographic keys responsible for Blu-ray and HD DVD content scrambling were discovered and released onto the Internet. In both cases, the Motion Picture Association of America sent out numerous DMCA takedown notices, and there was a massive Internet backlash[10] triggered by the perceived impact of such notices on fair use and free speech.\nForced disclosure of encryption keys\n[edit]In the United Kingdom, the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act gives UK police the powers to force suspects to decrypt files or hand over passwords that protect encryption keys. Failure to comply is an offense in its own right, punishable on conviction by a two-year jail sentence or up to five years in cases involving national security.[8] Successful prosecutions have occurred under the Act; the first, in 2009,[89] resulted in a term of 13 months' imprisonment.[90] Similar forced disclosure laws in Australia, Finland, France, and India compel individual suspects under investigation to hand over encryption keys or passwords during a criminal investigation.\nIn the United States, the federal criminal case of United States v. Fricosu addressed whether a search warrant can compel a person to reveal an encryption passphrase or password.[91] The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) argued that this is a violation of the protection from self-incrimination given by the Fifth Amendment.[92] In 2012, the court ruled that under the All Writs Act, the defendant was required to produce an unencrypted hard drive for the court.[93]\nIn many jurisdictions, the legal status of forced disclosure remains unclear.\nThe 2016 FBI–Apple encryption dispute concerns the ability of courts in the United States to compel manufacturers' assistance in unlocking cell phones whose contents are cryptographically protected.\nAs a potential counter-measure to forced disclosure some cryptographic software supports plausible deniability, where the encrypted data is indistinguishable from unused random data (for example such as that of a drive which has been securely wiped).\nSee also\n[edit]- Collision attack\n- Comparison of cryptography libraries\n- Cryptovirology – Securing and encrypting virology\n- Crypto Wars – Attempts to limit access to strong cryptography\n- Encyclopedia of Cryptography and Security – Book by Technische Universiteit Eindhoven\n- Global surveillance – Mass surveillance across national borders\n- Indistinguishability obfuscation – Type of cryptographic software obfuscation\n- Information theory – Scientific study of digital information\n- Outline of cryptography\n- List of cryptographers – A list of historical mathmaticians\n- List of multiple discoveries\n- List of unsolved problems in computer science – List of unsolved computational problems\n- Pre-shared key – Method to set encryption keys\n- Secure cryptoprocessor\n- Strong cryptography – Term applied to cryptographic systems that are highly resistant to cryptanalysis\n- Syllabical and Steganographical Table – Eighteenth-century work believed to be the first cryptography chart – first cryptography chart\n- World Wide Web Consortium's Web Cryptography API – World Wide Web Consortium cryptography standard\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ Liddell, Henry George; Scott, Robert; Jones, Henry Stuart; McKenzie, Roderick (1984).

Thus, preventing unauthorized access to information. The prefix \"crypt\" means \"hidden\" and the suffix \"graphy\" means \"writing\". In Cryptography, the techniques that are used to protect information are obtained from mathematical concepts and a set of rule-based calculations known as algorithms to convert messages in ways that make it hard to decode them. These algorithms are used for cryptographic key generation, digital signing, and verification to protect data privacy, web browsing on the internet and to protect confidential transactions such as credit card and debit card transactions. Features Of Cryptography The features of cryptography that makes it a popular choice in various applications could be listed down as: Confidentiality: Information can only be accessed by the person for whom it is intended and no other person except him can access it. Integrity: Information cannot be modified in storage or transition between sender and intended receiver without any addition to information being detected. Non-repudiation: The creator/sender of information cannot deny his intention to send information at a later stage. Authentication: The identities of the sender and receiver are confirmed. As well destination/origin of the information is confirmed. Interoperability: Cryptography allows for secure communication between different systems and platforms. Adaptability: Cryptography continuously evolves to stay ahead of security threats and technological advancements. How Does a Cryptographic Key Work?As we all know that cryptography technique is use to convert plain text into ciphertext. This technique is done by cryptographic key. Basically cryptographic key is a string of characters which is used to encrypts the data and decrypt the data. \"Geeks for Geeks\" + ⚿ = \"HYMeAS90#\"For example- \"Geeks for Geeks\" is a plaintext and convert into ciphertext \"HYMeAS90#\" with the help of cryptographic key.Types Of Cryptography There are three types of cryptography, namely Symmetric Key Cryptography, Asymmetric Key Cryptography and Hash functions, here's a detailed explanation below: 1. Symmetric Key Cryptography Symmetric Key Cryptography is an encryption system where the sender and receiver of a message use a single common key to encrypt and decrypt messages. Symmetric Key cryptography is faster and simpler but the problem is that the sender and receiver have to somehow exchange keys securely. The most popular symmetric key cryptography systems are Data Encryption Systems (DES) and Advanced Encryption Systems (AES) . Symmetric Key Cryptography 2. Hash Functions There is no key required in hash function cryptography as it uses mathematical equations to genrate a hash message for nay arbitrary length of message, and the output will be of fixed length. Some of the famous hash function are:SHA-256MD5MD63. Asymmetric Key Cryptography In Asymmetric Key Cryptography , a pair of keys is used to encrypt and decrypt information. A sender's public key is used for encryption and a receiver's private key is used for decryption. Public keys and Private keys are different. Even if the public key is known by everyone the intended receiver can only decode it because he holds his private key. The most popular asymmetric key cryptography algorithm is the RSA algorithm. Asymmetric Key Cryptography Applications of Cryptography Cryptography has wide area of applications in the modern world, where the technology is rapidly evolving. From authentication measures to cryptocurrencies, cryptography is here to stay, these are some of the most common applications of cryptography listed below:Computer passwords: Cryptography is widely utilized in computer security, particularly when creating and maintaining passwords. When a user logs in, their password is hashed and compared to the hash that was previously stored. Passwords are hashed and encrypted before being stored. In this technique, the passwords are encrypted so that even if a hacker gains access to the password database, they cannot read the passwords. Digital Currencies: To protect transactions and prevent fraud, digital currencies like Bitcoin also use cryptography. Complex algorithms and cryptographic keys are used to safeguard transactions, making it nearly hard to tamper with or forge the transactions. Secure web browsing: Online browsing security is provided by the use of cryptography, which shields users from eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle assaults. Public key cryptography is used by the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols to encrypt data sent between the web server and the client, establishing a secure channel for communication. Electronic Signatures: Electronic signatures serve as the digital equivalent of a handwritten signature and are used to sign documents. Digital signatures are created using cryptography and can be validated using public key cryptography. In many nations, electronic signatures are enforceable by law, and their use is expanding quickly. Authentication: Cryptography is used for authentication in many different situations, such as when accessing a bank account, logging into a computer, or using a secure network. Cryptographic methods are employed by authentication protocols to confirm the user's identity and confirm that they have the required access rights to the resource. Cryptocurrencies: Cryptography is heavily used by cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum to protect transactions, thwart fraud, and maintain the network's integrity. Complex algorithms and cryptographic keys are used to safeguard transactions, making it nearly hard to tamper with or forge the transactions. End-to-end Internet Encryption: End-to-end encryption is used to protect two-way communications like video conversations, instant messages, and email. Even if the message is encrypted, it assures that only the intended receivers can read the message. End-to-end encryption is widely used in communication apps like WhatsApp and Signal, and it provides a high level of security and privacy for users. Types of Cryptography Algorithm Cryptography Algorithms can be classified into several categories based on the way they utilize and manage their keys, their efficiency and workflow, here are the most common algorithmsAdvanced Encryption Standard (AES): AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a popular encryption algorithm which uses the same key for encryption and decryption It is a symmetric block cipher algorithm with block size of 128 bits, 192 bits or 256 bits. AES algorithm is widely regarded as the replacement of DES (Data encryption standard) algorithm.Data Encryption Standard (DES): DES (Data encryption standard) is an older encryption algorithm that is used to convert 64-bit plaintext data into 48-bit encrypted ciphertext. It uses symmetric keys (which means same key for encryption and decryption). It is kind of old by today’s standard but can be used as a basic building block for learning newer encryption algorithms. RSA: RSA is an basic asymmetric cryptographic algorithm which uses two different keys for encryption. The RSA algorithm works on a block cipher concept that converts plain text into cipher text and vice versa. Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA): SHA is used to generate unique fixed-length digital fingerprints of input data known as hashes. SHA variations such as SHA-2 and SHA-3 are commonly used to ensure data integrity and authenticity. The tiniest change in input data drastically modifies the hash output, indicating a loss of integrity. Hashing is the process of storing key value pairs with the help of a hash function into a hash table. Advantages of Cryptography Cryptography has some remarkable features that makes it widely adapted all over the world in different technologies, here are few points that makes it stand out:Cryptography can be used for access control to ensure that only parties with the proper permissions have access to a resource. For secure online communication, it offers secure mechanisms for transmitting private information like passwords, bank account numbers, and other sensitive data over the Internet. It helps in the defense against various types of assaults including replay and man-in-the-middle attacks.Cryptography can help firms in meeting a variety of legal requirements including data protection and privacy legislation. ConclusionCryptography is used to secure information and communications by converting data into coded formats, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authentication. It is essential for a wide range of applications, including securing online transactions, web browsing, passwords, digital currencies, and authentication.Cryptography continuously evolves to stay ahead of security threats, offering solutions such as symmetric key encryption (AES), asymmetric key encryption (RSA), and hash functions (SHA) to ensure data privacy and integrity.With its widespread applications in fields like secure web browsing, cryptocurrencies, electronic signatures, and end-to-end encryption, cryptography plays a vital role in protecting sensitive data from malicious actors. As digital threats continue to rise, cryptography ensures that only authorized parties can access, modify, or transmit critical information securely.

          "content": "What Is Cryptography?\nDiscover the types of cryptography and how to minimize the potential risks it poses.\n2025 CYBER THREAT PREDICTIONS 2025 THREAT LANDSCAPE REPORTCryptography is the process of hiding or coding information so that only the person a message was intended for can read it. The art of cryptography has been used to code messages for thousands of years and continues to be used in bank cards, computer passwords, and ecommerce.\nModern cryptography techniques include algorithms and ciphers that enable the encryption and decryption of information, such as 128-bit and 256-bit encryption keys. Modern ciphers, such as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), are considered virtually unbreakable.\nA common cryptography definition is the practice of coding information to ensure only the person that a message was written for can read and process the information. This cybersecurity practice, also known as cryptology, combines various disciplines like computer science, engineering, and mathematics to create complex codes that hide the true meaning of a message.\nCryptography can be traced all the way back to ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics but remains vital to securing communication and information in transit and preventing it from being read by untrusted parties. It uses algorithms and mathematical concepts to transform messages into difficult-to-decipher codes through techniques like cryptographic keys and digital signing to protect data privacy, credit card transactions, email, and web browsing.\nCryptography remains important to protecting data and users, ensuring confidentiality, and preventing cyber criminals from intercepting sensitive corporate information. Common uses and examples of cryptography include the following:\nIndividuals and organizations use cryptography on a daily basis to protect their privacy and keep their conversations and data confidential. Cryptography ensures confidentiality by encrypting sent messages using an algorithm with a key only known to the sender and recipient. A common example of this is the messaging tool WhatsApp, which encrypts conversations between people to ensure they cannot be hacked or intercepted.\nCryptography also secures browsing, such as with virtual private networks (VPNs), which use encrypted tunnels, asymmetric encryption, and public and private shared keys.\nSimilar to how cryptography can confirm the authenticity of a message, it can also prove the integrity of the information being sent and received. Cryptography ensures information is not altered while in storage or during transit between the sender and the intended recipient. For example, digital signatures can detect forgery or tampering in software distribution and financial transactions.\nCryptography confirms accountability and responsibility from the sender of a message, which means they cannot later deny their intentions when they created or transmitted information. Digital signatures are a good example of this, as they ensure a sender cannot claim a message, contract, or document they created to be fraudulent. Furthermore, in email nonrepudiation, email tracking makes sure the sender cannot deny sending a message and a recipient cannot deny receiving it.\nKey exchange is the method used to share cryptographic keys between a sender and their recipient.\nThere are many types of cryptographic algorithms available. They vary in complexity and security, depending on the type of communication and the sensitivity of the information being shared.\nSecret key cryptography, also known as symmetric encryption, uses a single key to encrypt and decrypt a message. The sender encrypts the plaintext message using the key and sends it to the recipient who then uses the same key to decrypt it and unlock the original plaintext message.\nStream ciphers work on a single bit or byte at any time and constantly change the key using feedback mechanisms. A self-synchronizing stream cipher ensures the decryption process stays in sync with the encryption process by recognizing where it sits in the bit keystream. A synchronous stream cipher generates the keystream independently of the message stream and generates the same keystream function at both the sender and the receiver.\nBlock ciphers encrypt one block of fixed-size data at a time. It will always encrypt a plaintext data block to the same ciphertext when the same key is used. A good example of this is the Feistel cipher, which uses elements of key expansion, permutation, and substitution to create vast confusion and diffusion in the cipher.\nThe stages of encryption and decryption are similar if not identical, which means reversing the key reduces the code size and circuitry required for implementing the cipher in a piece of software or hardware.\nPublic key cryptography (PKC), or asymmetric cryptography, uses mathematical functions to create codes that are exceptionally difficult to crack. It enables people to communicate securely over a nonsecure communications channel without the need for a secret key. For example, proxy reencryption enables a proxy entity to reencrypt data from one public key to another without requiring access to the plaintext or private keys.\nA common PKC type is multiplication vs. factorization, which takes two large prime numbers and multiplies them to create a huge resulting number that makes deciphering difficult. Another form of PKC is exponentiation vs. logarithms such as 256-bit encryption, which increases protection to the point that even a computer capable of searching trillions of combinations per second cannot crack it.\nGeneric forms of PKC use two keys that are related mathematically but do not enable either to be determined. Put simply, a sender can encrypt their plaintext message using their private key, then the recipient decrypts the ciphertext using the sender’s public key.\nCommon PKC algorithms used for digital signatures and key exchanges include:\nRSA was the first and remains the most common PKC implementation. The algorithm is named after its MIT mathematician developers, Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, and is used in data encryption, digital signatures, and key exchanges. It uses a large number that is the result of factoring two selected prime numbers. It is impossible for an attacker to work out the prime factors, which makes RSA especially secure.\nECC is a PKC algorithm based on the use of elliptic curves in cryptography. It is designed for devices with limited computing power or memory to encrypt internet traffic. A common use of ECC is in embedded computers, smartphones, and cryptocurrency networks like bitcoin, which consumes around 10% of the storage space and bandwidth that RSA requires.\nDSA is a standard that enables digital signatures to be used in message authentication. It was introduced by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 1991 to ensure a better method for creating digital signatures.\nIBE is a PKC system that enables the public key to be calculated from unique information based on the user’s identity, such as their email address. A trusted third party or private key generator then uses a cryptographic algorithm to calculate a corresponding private key. This enables users to create their own private keys without worrying about distributing public keys.\nAll PKC algorithms and usage are governed by a set of standards and guidelines designed by RSA Data Security. These are as follows:\nThe Diffie-Hellman algorithm was devised in 1976 by Stanford University professor Martin Hellman and his graduate student Whitfield Diffie, who are considered to be responsible for introducing PKC as a concept. It is used for secret key exchanges and requires two people to agree on a large prime number.\nKEA is a variation of the Diffie-Hellman algorithm and was proposed as a method for key exchange in the NIST/National Security Agency’s (NSA) Capstone project, which developed cryptography standards for public and government use.\nHash functions ensure that data integrity is maintained in the encryption and decryption phases of cryptography. It is also used in databases so that items can be retrieved more quickly.\nHashing is the process of taking a key and mapping it to a specific value, which is the hash or hash value. A hash function transforms a key or digital signature, then the hash value and signature are sent to the receiver, who uses the hash function to generate the hash value and compare it with the one they received in the message.\nA common hash function is folding, which takes a value and divides it into several parts, adds parts, and uses the last four remaining digits as the key or hashed value. Another is digit rearrangement, which takes specific digits in the original value, reverses them, and uses the remaining number as the hash value. Examples of hash function types include Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1), SHA-2, and SHA-3.\nWhat are cryptographic key attacks? Modern cryptographic key techniques are increasingly advanced and often even considered unbreakable. However, as more entities rely on cryptography to protect communications and data, it is vital to keep keys secure. One compromised key could result in regulatory action, fines and punishments, reputational damage, and the loss of customers and investors. Potential key-based issues and attack types that could occur include:\nKeys are essentially random numbers that become more difficult to crack the longer the number is. Key strength and length need to be relative to the value of the data it protects and the length of time that data needs to be protected. Keys should be created with a high-quality, certified random number generator that collects entropy—the information density of a file in bits or characters—from suitable hardware noise sources.\nWhen keys are used improperly or encoded poorly, it becomes easier for a hacker to crack what should have been a highly secure key.\nEvery key should only be generated for a specific single-use encrypt/decrypt purpose, and use beyond that may not offer the level of protection required.\nKeys that are overused, such as encrypting too much data on a key, become vulnerable to attacks. This is particularly the case with older ciphers and could result in data being exposed. Keys need to be rotated, renewed, and updated when appropriate.\nStoring keys alongside the information they have been created to protect increases their chances of being compromised. For example, keys stored on a database or server that gets breached could also be compromised when the data is exfiltrated.\nHuge cyberattacks like Meltdown/Spectre and Heartbleed have been capable of exposing cryptographic keys stored in server memory. Therefore, stored keys must be encrypted and only made available unencrypted when placed within secure, tamper-protected environments, or even kept offline.\nMoving keys between systems should only occur when the key is encrypted or wrapped under an asymmetric or symmetric pre-shared transport key. If this is not possible, then the key must be split up into multiple parts that are kept separate, re-entered into the target system, then destroyed.\nInsider threats are one of the most serious threats posed to any key. This is most likely to occur through a rogue employee having access to a key, then using it for malicious purposes or giving or selling it to a hacker or third party.\nResilience is vital to protecting the availability, confidentiality, and integrity of keys. Any key that suffers a fault with no backup results in the data the key protects being lost or inaccessible.\nKey life cycles must be logged and recorded in full to ensure any compromise can be tracked and enable subsequent investigations to occur smoothly.\nRecording key management processes manually on paper or spreadsheets runs the risk of human error and makes the keys highly vulnerable to attack or theft.\nOrganizations and individuals can minimize and mitigate cryptography-related threats with a dedicated electronic key management system from a reputable provider. The solution must use a hardware security module to generate and protect keys, and underpin the entire system’s security.\nIt needs to include features like full key management life cycle, strong key generation, strict policy-based controls, swift compromise detection, secure key destruction, strong user authentication, secure workflow management, and a secure audit and usage log. This will protect the organization's keys, enhance efficiency, and ensure compliance with data and privacy regulations.\nAnother potential solution is cryptography quantum, whereby it is impossible to copy data encoded in a quantum state.\nIn computer science, cryptography is the collection of secure information and communication techniques employing mathematical concepts and algorithms used to disguise the content of messages.\nThe three types of cryptography are:\nThe Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) algorithm is widely used on the Internet. RSA uses a pair of keys to encrypt and decrypt information.\nPlease fill out the form and a knowledgeable representative will get in touch with you soon.",

          "content": "Cryptography is the practice of developing and using coded algorithms to protect and obscure transmitted information so that it may only be read by those with the permission and ability to decrypt it. Put differently, cryptography obscures communications so that unauthorized parties are unable to access them.\nIn our modern digital age, cryptography has become an essential cybersecurity tool for protecting sensitive information from hackers and other cybercriminals.\nDerived from the Greek word “kryptos,” meaning hidden, cryptography literally translates to “hidden writing.” It can be used to obscure any form of digital communication, including text, images, video or audio. In practice, cryptography is mainly used to transform messages into an unreadable format (known as ciphertext) that can only be decrypted into a readable format (known as plain text) by the authorized intended recipient by using a specific secret key.\nCryptology, which encompasses both cryptography and cryptanalysis, is deeply rooted in computer science and advanced mathematics. The history of cryptography dates back to ancient times when Julius Caesar created the Caesar cipher to obscure the content of his messages from the messengers who carried them in the first century B.C.. Today, organizations like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) continue to develop cryptographic standards for data security.\nModern cryptography has grown significantly more advanced over time. However, the general idea remains the same and has coalesced around four main principles.\nIn today’s digital landscape, cryptography plays a vital role in our daily lives, ensuring that sensitive data like credit card numbers, e-commerce transactions and even WhatsApp messages remain confidential and secure.\nOn a macro level, advanced cryptography is crucial for maintaining national security, safeguarding classified information from potential threat actors and adversaries.\nThese are some of the most common use cases for cryptography.\nCryptography is frequently used to validate password authenticity while also obscuring stored passwords. In this way, services can authenticate passwords without the need to keep a plain text database of all passwords which might be vulnerable to hackers.\nCryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are built on complex data encryptions that require significant amounts of computational power to decrypt. Through these decryption processes, new coins are “minted” and enter circulation. Cryptocurrencies also rely on advanced cryptography to safeguard crypto wallets, verify transactions and prevent fraud.\nWhen browsing secure websites, cryptography protects users from eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols rely on public key cryptography to protect data sent between the web server and client and establish secure communications channels.\nElectronic signatures, or e-signatures, are used to sign important documents online and are frequently enforceable by law. Electronic signatures created with cryptography can be validated to prevent fraud and forgeries.\nIn situations where identity authentication is necessary, such as logging in to an online bank account or accessing a secure network, cryptography can help confirm or verify a user’s identity and authenticate their access privileges.\nWhether sharing classified state secrets or simply having a private conversation, end-to-end encryption is used for message authentication and to protect two-way communications like video conversations, instant messages and email. End-to-end encryption provides a high level of security and privacy for users and is widely used in communication apps like WhatsApp and Signal.\nThere are two main types of encryption in use today: symmetric cryptography and asymmetric cryptography. Both types use keys to encrypt and decrypt data sent and received. There are also hybrid cryptosystems that combine both.\nA cryptosystem is considered symmetrical when each party—sender and receiver—uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data. Algorithms such as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Data Encryption Standard(DES) are symmetric systems.\nAsymmetric cryptography uses multiple keys—some shared and some private. In this way, the sender and receiver of an encrypted message have asymmetrical keys, and the system is asymmetrical. RSA—named after its progenitors Rivest, Shamir and Adleman—is one of the most common public key encryption algorithms.\nWhile asymmetric systems are often considered to be more secure due to their use of private keys, the true measure of a system’s strength is more dependent on key length and complexity.\nSymmetric key cryptography uses a shared single key for both encryption and decryption. In symmetric cryptography, both the sender and receiver of an encrypted message will have access to the same secret key.\nCaesar’s cipher is an early example of a single key system. This primitive cipher worked by transposing each letter of a message forward by three letters, which would turn the word “cat” into “fdw” (although Caesar would have probably used the Latin word “cattus”). Since Caesar’s generals knew the key, they would be able to unscramble the message by simply reversing the transposition. In this way, symmetrical cryptosystems require each party to have access to the secret key before the encrypting, sending and decrypting of any information.\nSome of the main attributes of symmetric encryption include:\nAsymmetric cryptography (also referred to as public key cryptography) uses one private key and one public key. Data that is encrypted with a public and private key requires both the public key and the recipient’s private key to be decrypted.\nPublic key cryptography enables secure key exchange over an insecure medium without the need to share a secret decryption key because the public key is only used in the encryption, but not the decryption process. In this way, asymmetric encryption adds an additional layer of security because an individual’s private key is never shared.\nSome of the main attributes of symmetric encryption include:\nCryptographic keys are essential for the secure use of encryption algorithms. Key management is a complex aspect of cryptography involving the generation, exchange, storage, use, destruction and replacement of keys. The Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm is a method used to securely exchange cryptographic keys over a public channel. Asymmetric key cryptography is a critical component in key exchange protocols.\nUnlike Caesar’s cipher, which used a shifted Roman alphabet as a key, modern keys are far more complex and typically contain 128, 256 or 2,048 bits of information. Advanced cryptographic algorithms use these bits to rearrange and scramble the plain text data into ciphertext. As the number of bits increases, the number of total possible arrangements of the data rises exponentially.\nCaesar’s cipher uses few bits and it would be easy for a computer to decrypt (even without the secret key) by simply trying all the possible arrangements of the scrambled ciphertext until the entire message was transformed into readable plain text. Hackers call this technic a brute force attack.\nAdding more bits makes brute force attacks prohibitively difficult to compute. While a 56-bit system can be brute forced in 399 seconds by today’s most powerful computers, a 128-bit key would require 1.872 x 1037 years. A 256-bit system would take 3.31 x 1056 years.\nFor reference, the entire universe is believed to have existed for only 13.7 billion years, which is less than a percent of a percent of the time it would take to brute force either a 128-bit or 256-bit cryptosystem.\nAn encryption algorithm is a component of a cryptosystem that performs the transformation of data into ciphertext. Block ciphers like AES operate on fixed-size blocks of data by using a symmetric key for encryption and decryption. Stream ciphers, conversely, encrypt data one bit at a time.\nDigital signatures and hash functions are used for authentication and ensuring data integrity. A digital signature created with cryptography provides a means of non-repudiation, ensuring that a message's sender cannot deny the authenticity of their signature on a document.\nHash functions, like the Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1), can transform an input into a string of characters of a fixed length, which is unique to the original data. This hash value helps in verifying the integrity of data by making it computationally infeasible to find two different inputs that might produce the same output hash.\nIn keeping pace with advancing technology and increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, the field of cryptography continues to evolve. Next-generation advanced protocols like quantum cryptography and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) represent the cutting edge of cryptographic techniques.\nConsidered to be one of the main focal points of the next generation, elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is a public key encryption technique based on elliptic curve theory that can create faster, smaller and more efficient cryptographic keys.\nTraditional asymmetric cryptosystems, while secure, are difficult to scale. They require a lot of resources and become sluggish as they are applied to larger amounts of data. Furthermore, attempts to improve the security of public key cryptosystems to evade increasingly powerful attacks require increasing the bit length of the public and private keys, which significantly slows the encryption and decryption process.\nFirst-generation public key cryptosystems are built on the mathematic functions of multiplication and factoring, in which public and private keys reveal the specific mathematical functions necessary to both encrypt plain text and decrypt ciphertext. These keys are made by multiplying prime numbers. ECC uses elliptical curves—equations that can be represented as curved lines on a graph—to generate public and private keys based on different points on the line graph.\nIn a world where we are increasingly reliant on devices with less computing power, such as mobile phones, ECC provides an elegant solution based on the obscure mathematics of elliptical curves to generate smaller keys that are more difficult to crack.\nThe advantages of ECC over previous public key cryptosystems are undisputed, and the US government, Bitcoin and Apple's iMessage service already use it. While first-generation systems like RSA are still effective for most settings, ECC is poised to become the new standard for privacy and security online—especially as the tremendous potential of quantum computing looms over the horizon.\nWhile quantum computers are still in their infancy and difficult to build, program and maintain, the potential increase in computation power would render all known public key encryption systems insecure, since a quantum machine could theoretically achieve a brute force attack significantly faster than classical computers.\nQuantum cryptography uses the principles of quantum mechanics to secure data in a way that is immune to many of the vulnerabilities of traditional cryptosystems. Unlike other types of encryption that rely on mathematic principles, quantum cryptography is based on physics to secure data in a way that is theoretically immune to hackers. Because it is impossible for a quantum state to be observed without it being changed, any attempts to covertly access quantum encoded data would be immediately identified.\nOriginally theorized in 1984, quantum encryption functions by using photon light particles sent across a fiberoptic cable to share a private key between the sender and receiver. This stream of photons travel in a single direction and each one represents a single bit of data, either 0 or 1. A polarized filter on the sender’s side changes the physical orientation of each photon to a specific position, and the receiver uses two available beam splitters to read the position of each photon. The sender and receiver compare the sent photon positions to the decoded positions, and the set that matches is the key.\nQuantum cryptography provides many benefits over traditional cryptography because it does not rely on potentially solvable math equations to secure encrypted data. It also prevents eavesdropping since quantum data cannot be read without also being changed, and quantum cryptography can also integrate well with other types of encryption protocols. This type of cryptography enables users to digitally share a private encryption key that cannot be copied during transit. Once this key is shared, it can be used to encrypt and decrypt further messages in a way that has almost no risk of being compromised.\nHowever, quantum cryptography also faces many challenges and limitations that have yet to be solved and currently prevent practical use of quantum cryptography. As quantum computing has yet to crossover from proofs of concept into practical application, quantum cryptography remains prone to error due to unintended changes in photon polarization.\nQuantum cryptography also requires specific infrastructure. Fiber optic lines are necessary for transferring photons and have a limited range of typically about 248 to 310 miles, which computer science researchers are working to extend. Additionally, quantum cryptography systems are limited by the number of destinations where they can send data. Since these types of systems rely on the specific orientation of unique photons, they are incapable of sending a signal to more than one intended recipient at any time.",

          "content": "Cryptography\nCryptography,[1] or cryptology, is the practice and study of hiding information. It is sometimes called code, but this is not really a correct name. It is the science used to try to keep information secret and safe.\nModern cryptography is a mix of mathematics, computer science, and electrical engineering. Cryptography is used in ATM (bank) cards, computer passwords, and shopping on the internet.\nWhen a message is sent using cryptography, it is changed (or encrypted) before it is sent. The method of changing text is called a \"code\" or, more precisely, a \"cipher\". The changed text is called \"ciphertext\". The change makes the message hard to read. Someone who wants to read it must change it back (or decrypt it). How to change it back is a secret. Both the person that sends the message and the one that gets it should know the secret way to change it, but other people should not be able to. Studying the cyphertext to discover the secret is called \"cryptanalysis\" or \"cracking\" or sometimes \"code breaking\".[2][3]\nDifferent types of cryptography can be easier or harder to use and can hide the secret message better or worse. Ciphers use a \"key\" which is a secret that hides the secret messages. The cryptographic method needn't be secret. Various people can use the same method but different keys, so they cannot read each other's messages. Since the Caesar cipher has only as many keys as the number of letters in the alphabet, it is easily cracked by trying all the keys. Ciphers that allow billions of keys are cracked by more complex methods.\nSince the time of Caesar, many improved cyphers have been made. Some involved clever mathematics to resist clever cryptanalysis. During the 20th century computers became the principle tool of cryptography.\nSymmetric\n[change | change source]In a symmetric-key algorithm, both the sender and receiver share the key. The sender uses the key to hide the message. Then, the receiver will use the same key in the opposite way to reveal the message. For centuries, most cryptography has been symmetric. Advanced Encryption Standard is a widely used one. However this is not to be confused with symmetry.\nAsymmetric\n[change | change source]Asymmetric cryptography is harder to use. Each person who wants to use asymmetric cryptography uses a secret number (a \"private key\") that is not shared, and a different number (a \"public key\") that they can tell everyone. If someone else wants to send this person a message, they'll use the number they've been told to hide the message. Now the message cannot be revealed, even by the sender, but the receiver can easily reveal the message with his secret or \"private key\". This way, nobody else needs to know the secret key.\nAsymmetric cryptography generally takes more time and requires more computer power,[4] therefore it is not used most of the time. Instead, it is often used for computer signatures, when a computer must know that some data (like a file or a website) was sent from a certain sender. For example, computer software companies that release updates for their software can sign those updates to prove that the update was made by them, so that hackers cannot make their own updates that would cause harm. Websites that use HTTPS use an popular algorithm named RSA to create certificates, that show they own the website and that it is secure. Computers can also use asymmetric ciphers to give each other the keys for symmetric ciphers.\nComputers\n[change | change source]Computers can calculate quickly. They can make very strong encryption, and most 21st century cryptography uses them. Examples are computer algorithms like RSA, AES, and there are many others. Using good algorithms like these can make it very hard to read the information that is sent.\nPeople\n[change | change source]Because people are slower than computers, any cryptography they use can probably be broken if enough of the secret way to change it is known.\nSimple forms of cryptography that people can do without machines are Caesar ciphers and transposition ciphers, but many other kinds were used before computers were used.[5]\nReferences\n[change | change source]- ↑ The word comes from Greek κρυπτός, kryptos, \"hidden, secret\"; and γράφω, gráphō, \"I write\", or -λογία, logia, respectively)Liddell and Scott's Greek-English Lexicon.

          "content": "Cryptography law\nCryptography is the practice and study of encrypting information, or in other words, securing information from unauthorized access. There are many different cryptography laws in different nations. Some countries prohibit the export of cryptography software and/or encryption algorithms or cryptoanalysis methods. Some countries require decryption keys to be recoverable in case of a police investigation.\nOverview\n[edit]Issues regarding cryptography law fall into four categories:[1]\n- Export control, is the restriction on the export of cryptography methods within a country to other countries or commercial entities. There are international export control agreements, the main one being the Wassenaar Arrangement. The Wassenaar Arrangement was created after the dissolution of COCOM (Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls), which in 1989 \"decontrolled password and authentication-only cryptography.\"[2]\n- Import controls, which is the restriction on using certain types of cryptography within a country.\n- Patent issues, deal with the use of cryptography tools that are patented.\n- Search and seizure issues, on whether and under what circumstances, a person can be compelled to decrypt data files or reveal an encryption key.\nLegal issues\n[edit]Prohibitions\n[edit]Cryptography has long been of interest to intelligence gathering and law enforcement agencies.[3] Secret communications may be criminal or even treasonous [citation needed]. Because of its facilitation of privacy, and the diminution of privacy attendant on its prohibition, cryptography is also of considerable interest to civil rights supporters. Accordingly, there has been a history of controversial legal issues surrounding cryptography, especially since the advent of inexpensive computers has made widespread access to high-quality cryptography possible.\nIn some countries, even the domestic use of cryptography is, or has been, restricted. Until 1999, France significantly restricted the use of cryptography domestically, though it has since relaxed many of these rules. In China and Iran, a license is still required to use cryptography.[4] Many countries have tight restrictions on the use of cryptography. Among the more restrictive are laws in Belarus, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Pakistan, Singapore, Tunisia, and Vietnam.[5]\nIn the United States, cryptography is legal for domestic use, but there has been much conflict over legal issues related to cryptography.[3] One particularly important issue has been the export of cryptography and cryptographic software and hardware. Probably because of the importance of cryptanalysis in World War II and an expectation that cryptography would continue to be important for national security, many Western governments have, at some point, strictly regulated export of cryptography. After World War II, it was illegal in the US to sell or distribute encryption technology overseas; in fact, encryption was designated as auxiliary military equipment and put on the United States Munitions List.[6] Until the development of the personal computer, asymmetric key algorithms (i.e., public key techniques), and the Internet, this was not especially problematic. However, as the Internet grew and computers became more widely available, high-quality encryption techniques became well known around the globe.[citation needed]\nExport controls\n[edit]In the 1990s, there were several challenges to US export regulation of cryptography. After the source code for Philip Zimmermann's Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) encryption program found its way onto the Internet in June 1991, a complaint by RSA Security (then called RSA Data Security, Inc.) resulted in a lengthy criminal investigation of Zimmermann by the US Customs Service and the FBI, though no charges were ever filed.[7][8] Daniel J. Bernstein, then a graduate student at UC Berkeley, brought a lawsuit against the US government challenging some aspects of the restrictions based on free speech grounds. The 1995 case Bernstein v. United States ultimately resulted in a 1999 decision that printed source code for cryptographic algorithms and systems was protected as free speech by the United States Constitution.[9]\nIn 1996, thirty-nine countries signed the Wassenaar Arrangement, an arms control treaty that deals with the export of arms and \"dual-use\" technologies such as cryptography. The treaty stipulated that the use of cryptography with short key-lengths (56-bit for symmetric encryption, 512-bit for RSA) would no longer be export-controlled.[10] Cryptography exports from the US became less strictly regulated as a consequence of a major relaxation in 2000;[11] there are no longer very many restrictions on key sizes in US-exported mass-market software. Since this relaxation in US export restrictions, and because most personal computers connected to the Internet include US-sourced web browsers such as Firefox or Internet Explorer, almost every Internet user worldwide has potential access to quality cryptography via their browsers (e.g., via Transport Layer Security). The Mozilla Thunderbird and Microsoft Outlook E-mail client programs can similarly transmit and receive emails via TLS, and can send and receive emails encrypted with S/MIME. Many Internet users don't realize that their basic application software contains such extensive cryptosystems. These browsers and email programs are so ubiquitous that even governments whose intent is to regulate civilian use of cryptography generally don't find it practical to do much to control distribution or use of cryptography of this quality, so even when such laws are in force, actual enforcement is often effectively impossible.[citation needed]\nNSA involvement\n[edit]Another contentious issue connected to cryptography in the United States is the influence of the National Security Agency on cipher development and policy.[3] The NSA was involved with the design of DES during its development at IBM and its consideration by the National Bureau of Standards as a possible Federal Standard for cryptography.[12] DES was designed to be resistant to differential cryptanalysis,[13] a powerful and general cryptanalytic technique known to the NSA and IBM, that became publicly known only when it was rediscovered in the late 1980s.[14] According to Steven Levy, IBM discovered differential cryptanalysis,[8] but kept the technique secret at the NSA's request. The technique became publicly known only when Biham and Shamir re-discovered and announced it some years later. The entire affair illustrates the difficulty of determining what resources and knowledge an attacker might actually have.[citation needed]\nAnother instance of the NSA's involvement was the 1993 Clipper chip affair, an encryption microchip intended to be part of the Capstone cryptography-control initiative. Clipper was widely criticized by cryptographers for two reasons. The cipher algorithm (called Skipjack) was then classified (declassified in 1998, long after the Clipper initiative lapsed). The classified cipher caused concerns that the NSA had deliberately made the cipher weak in order to assist its intelligence efforts. The whole initiative was also criticized based on its violation of Kerckhoffs's Principle, as the scheme included a special escrow key held by the government for use by law enforcement (i.e. wiretapping).[8]\nDigital rights management\n[edit]Cryptography is central to digital rights management (DRM), a group of techniques for technologically controlling use of copyrighted material, being widely implemented and deployed at the behest of some copyright holders. In 1998, U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which criminalized all production, dissemination, and use of certain cryptanalytic techniques and technology (now known or later discovered); specifically, those that could be used to circumvent DRM technological schemes.[15] This had a noticeable impact on the cryptography research community since an argument can be made that any cryptanalytic research violated the DMCA. Similar statutes have since been enacted in several countries and regions, including the implementation in the EU Copyright Directive. Similar restrictions are called for by treaties signed by World Intellectual Property Organization member-states.[citation needed]\nThe United States Department of Justice and FBI have not enforced the DMCA as rigorously as had been feared by some, but the law, nonetheless, remains a controversial one. Niels Ferguson, a well-respected cryptography researcher, has publicly stated that he will not release some of his research into an Intel security design for fear of prosecution under the DMCA.[16] Cryptologist Bruce Schneier has argued that the DMCA encourages vendor lock-in, while inhibiting actual measures toward cyber-security.[17] Both Alan Cox (longtime Linux kernel developer) and Edward Felten (and some of his students at Princeton) have encountered problems related to the Act. Dmitry Sklyarov was arrested during a visit to the US from Russia, and jailed for five months pending trial for alleged violations of the DMCA arising from work he had done in Russia, where the work was legal. In 2007, the cryptographic keys responsible for Blu-ray and HD DVD content scrambling were discovered and released onto the Internet. In both cases, the Motion Picture Association of America sent out numerous DMCA takedown notices, and there was a massive Internet backlash triggered by the perceived impact of such notices on fair use and free speech.[18]\nForced disclosure of encryption keys\n[edit]In the United Kingdom, the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act gives UK police the powers to force suspects to decrypt files or hand over passwords that protect encryption keys. Failure to comply is an offense in its own right, punishable on conviction by a two-year jail sentence or up to five years in cases involving national security.[19] Successful prosecutions have occurred under the Act; the first, in 2009,[20] resulted in a term of 13 months' imprisonment.[21] Similar forced disclosure laws in Australia, Finland, France, and India compel individual suspects under investigation to hand over encryption keys or passwords during a criminal investigation.[citation needed]\nIn the United States, the federal criminal case of United States v. Fricosu addressed whether a search warrant can compel a person to reveal an encryption passphrase or password.[22] The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) argued that this is a violation of the protection from self-incrimination given by the Fifth Amendment.[23] In 2012, the court ruled that under the All Writs Act, the defendant was required to produce an unencrypted hard drive for the court.[24]\nIn many jurisdictions, the legal status of forced disclosure remains unclear.[citation needed]\nThe 2016 FBI–Apple encryption dispute concerns the ability of courts in the United States to compel manufacturers' assistance in unlocking cell phones whose contents are cryptographically protected.[citation needed][further explanation needed]\nAs a potential counter-measure to forced disclosure some cryptographic software supports plausible deniability, where the encrypted data is indistinguishable from unused random data (for example such as that of a drive which has been securely wiped).[citation needed]\nCryptography law in different countries\n[edit]China\n[edit]In October 1999, the State Council promulgated the Regulations on the Administration of Commercial Cryptography. According to these regulations, commercial cryptography was treated as a state secret.[25]\nOn 26 October 2019, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress promulgated the Cryptography Law of the People's Republic of China. This law went into effect at the start of 2020.[25][26] The law categorizes cryptography into three categories:[25][26]\n- Core cryptography, which is a state secret and suitable for information up to top secret;\n- Ordinary cryptography, which is also a state secret and suitable for information up to secret;\n- Commercial cryptography, which protects information that is not a state secret.\nThe law also states that there should be a \"mechanism of both in-process and ex-post supervision on commercial cryptography, which combines routine supervision with random inspection\" (implying that the Chinese government should get access to encrypted servers).[26] It also states that foreign providers of commercial encryption need some sort of state approval.[26]\nCryptosystems authorized for use in China include SM2, SM3, SM4 and SM9.[27]\nFrance\n[edit]As of 2011 and since 2004, the law for trust in the digital economy (French: Loi pour la confiance dans l'économie numérique; abbreviated LCEN) mostly liberalized the use of cryptography.[28]\n- As long as cryptography is only used for authentication and integrity purposes, it can be freely used. The cryptographic key or the nationality of the entities involved in the transaction do not matter. Typical e-business websites fall under this liberalized regime.\n- Exportation and importation of cryptographic tools to or from foreign countries must be either declared (when the other country is a member of the European Union) or requires an explicit authorization (for countries outside the EU).\nIndia\n[edit]Section 69 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (as amended in 2008) authorizes Indian government officials or policemen to listen in on any phone calls, read any SMS messages or emails, or monitor the websites that anyone visits, without requiring a warrant.[29]: 2 [30] (However, this is a violation of article 21 of the Constitution of India.[29]: 2 ) This section also enables the central government of India or a state government of India to compel any agency to decrypt information.[29]: 4\nAccording to the Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules, 2011, intermediaries are required to provide information to Indian government agencies for investigative or other purposes.[29]: 2 [clarification needed]\nISP license holders are freely allowed to use encryption keys up to 40 bits. Beyond that, they are required to obtain written permission and to deposit the decryption key with the Department of Telecommunications.[29]: 2–3\nPer the 2012 SEBI Master Circular for Stock Exchange or Cash Market (issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India), it is the responsibility of stock exchanges to maintain data reliability and confidentiality through the use of encryption.[29]: 3 Per Reserve Bank of India guidance issued in 2001, banks must use at least 128-bit SSL to protect browser-to-bank communication; they must also encrypt sensitive data internally.[29]: 3\nElectronics, including cryptographic products, is one of the categories of dual-use items in the Special Chemicals, Organisms, Materials, Equipment and Technologies (SCOMET; part of the Foreign Trade (Development & Regulation Act), 1992). However, this regulation does not specify which cryptographic products are subject to export controls.[29]: 3\nUnited States\n[edit]In the United States, the International Traffic in Arms Regulation restricts the export of cryptography.[citation needed][further explanation needed]\nSee also\n[edit]- Official Secrets Act - (United Kingdom, India, Ireland, Malaysia and formerly New Zealand)\n- Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (United Kingdom)\n- Restrictions on the import of cryptography\n- United States v.

          "content": "Artificial intelligence\nArtificial intelligence (AI) refers to the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.[1] Such machines may be called AIs.\nHigh-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore.\"[2][3]\nVarious subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics.[a] To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics.[b] AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.[4] Some companies, such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind and Meta, aim to create artificial general intelligence (AGI)—AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as humans.[5]\nArtificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956,[6] and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history,[7][8] followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winters.[9][10] Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks, and deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques.[11] This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture.[12] In the 2020s, the period of rapid progress marked by advanced generative AI became known as the AI boom. Generative AI and its ability to create and modify content exposed several unintended consequences and harms in the present and raised ethical concerns about AI's long-term effects and potential existential risks, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.\nGoals\nThe general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.[a]\nReasoning and problem-solving\nEarly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions.[13] By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.[14]\nMany of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow.[15] Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.[16] Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.\nKnowledge representation\nKnowledge representation and knowledge engineering[17] allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval,[18] scene interpretation,[19] clinical decision support,[20] knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large databases),[21] and other areas.[22]\nA knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge.[23] Knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects, properties, categories, and relations between objects;[24] situations, events, states, and time;[25] causes and effects;[26] knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);[27] default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing);[28] and many other aspects and domains of knowledge.\nAmong the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous);[29] and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally).[16] There is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition, the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications.[c]\nPlanning and decision-making\nAn \"agent\" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen.[d][32] In automated planning, the agent has a specific goal.[33] In automated decision-making, the agent has preferences—there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the \"utility\") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the \"expected utility\": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility.[34]\nIn classical planning, the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be.[35] In most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is \"unknown\" or \"unobservable\") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not \"deterministic\"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked.[36]\nIn some problems, the agent's preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with inverse reinforcement learning), or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences.[37] Information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions.[38] The space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be.\nA Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. A policy associates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e.g., by iteration), be heuristic, or it can be learned.[39]\nGame theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents.[40]\nLearning\nMachine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically.[41] It has been a part of AI from the beginning.[e]\nThere are several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance.[44] Supervised learning requires labeling the training data with the expected answers, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input).[45]\nIn reinforcement learning, the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as \"good\".[46] Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem.[47] Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning.[48]\nComputational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity, by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization.[49]\nNatural language processing\nNatural language processing (NLP)[50] allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages such as English. Specific problems include speech recognition, speech synthesis, machine translation, information extraction, information retrieval and question answering.[51]\nEarly work, based on Noam Chomsky's generative grammar and semantic networks, had difficulty with word-sense disambiguation[f] unless restricted to small domains called \"micro-worlds\" (due to the common sense knowledge problem[29]). Margaret Masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure.\nModern deep learning techniques for NLP include word embedding (representing words, typically as vectors encoding their meaning),[52] transformers (a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism),[53] and others.[54] In 2019, generative pre-trained transformer (or \"GPT\") language models began to generate coherent text,[55][56] and by 2023, these models were able to get human-level scores on the bar exam, SAT test, GRE test, and many other real-world applications.[57]\nPerception\nMachine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world. Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input.[58]\nThe field includes speech recognition,[59] image classification,[60] facial recognition, object recognition,[61]object tracking,[62] and robotic perception.[63]\nSocial intelligence\nAffective computing is a field that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human feeling, emotion, and mood.[65] For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction.\nHowever, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents.[66] Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis, wherein AI classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject.[67]\nGeneral intelligence\nA machine with artificial general intelligence should be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence.[68]\nTechniques\nAI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above.[b]\nSearch and optimization\nAI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions.[69] There are two very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search.\nState space search\nState space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state.[70] For example, planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis.[71]\nSimple exhaustive searches[72] are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is too slow or never completes.[15] \"Heuristics\" or \"rules of thumb\" can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal.[73]\nAdversarial search is used for game-playing programs, such as chess or Go. It searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves, looking for a winning position.[74]\nLocal search\nLocal search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem. It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally.[75]\nGradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function. Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks,[76] through the backpropagation algorithm.\nAnother type of local search is evolutionary computation, which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by \"mutating\" and \"recombining\" them, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation.[77]\nDistributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails).[78]\nLogic\nFormal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation.[79] Formal logic comes in two main forms: propositional logic (which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as \"and\", \"or\", \"not\" and \"implies\")[80] and predicate logic (which also operates on objects, predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as \"Every X is a Y\" and \"There are some Xs that are Ys\").[81]\nDeductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement (conclusion) from other statements that are given and assumed to be true (the premises).[82] Proofs can be structured as proof trees, in which nodes are labelled by sentences, and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules.\nGiven a problem and a set of premises, problem-solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms. In the case of Horn clauses, problem-solving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem.[83] In the more general case of the clausal form of first-order logic, resolution is a single, axiom-free rule of inference, in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved.[84]\nInference in both Horn clause logic and first-order logic is undecidable, and therefore intractable. However, backward reasoning with Horn clauses, which underpins computation in the logic programming language Prolog, is Turing complete. Moreover, its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages.[85]\nFuzzy logic assigns a \"degree of truth\" between 0 and 1. It can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true.[86]\nNon-monotonic logics, including logic programming with negation as failure, are designed to handle default reasoning.[28] Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains.\nProbabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning\nMany problems in AI (including reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics.[87] Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory, decision analysis,[88] and information value theory.[89] These tools include models such as Markov decision processes,[90] dynamic decision networks,[91] game theory and mechanism design.[92]\nBayesian networks[93] are a tool that can be used for reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm),[g][95] learning (using the expectation–maximization algorithm),[h][97] planning (using decision networks)[98] and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks).[91]\nProbabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing, and finding explanations for streams of data, thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters).[91]\nClassifiers and statistical learning methods\nThe simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e.g., \"if shiny then diamond\"), on one hand, and controllers (e.g., \"if diamond then pick up\"), on the other hand. Classifiers[99] are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match. They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning. Each pattern (also called an \"observation\") is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.[45]\nThere are many kinds of classifiers in use.[100] The decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm.[101] K-nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s, and Kernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s.[102] The naive Bayes classifier is reportedly the \"most widely used learner\"[103] at Google, due in part to its scalability.[104] Neural networks are also used as classifiers.[105]\nArtificial neural networks\nAn artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. It is trained to recognise patterns; once trained, it can recognise those patterns in fresh data. There is an input, at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output. Each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer. A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers.[105]\nLearning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. The most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm.[106] Neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data. In theory, a neural network can learn any function.[107]\nIn feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction.[108] Recurrent neural networks feed the output signal back into the input, which allows short-term memories of previous input events. Long short term memory is the most successful network architecture for recurrent networks.[109] Perceptrons[110] use only a single layer of neurons; deep learning[111] uses multiple layers. Convolutional neural networks strengthen the connection between neurons that are \"close\" to each other—this is especially important in image processing, where a local set of neurons must identify an \"edge\" before the network can identify an object.[112]\nDeep learning\nDeep learning[111] uses several layers of neurons between the network's inputs and outputs. The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits, letters, or faces.[113]\nDeep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, image classification,[114] and others. The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2021.[115] The sudden success of deep learning in 2012–2015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s)[i] but because of two factors: the incredible increase in computer power (including the hundred-fold increase in speed by switching to GPUs) and the availability of vast amounts of training data, especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing, such as ImageNet.[j]\nGPT\nGenerative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are large language models (LLMs) that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences. Text-based GPT models are pre-trained on a large corpus of text that can be from the Internet. The pretraining consists of predicting the next token (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation). Throughout this pretraining, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token. Typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful, and harmless, usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Current GPT models are prone to generating falsehoods called \"hallucinations\". These can be reduced with RLHF and quality data, but the problem has been getting worse for reasoning systems.[123] Such systems are used in chatbots, which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text.[124][125]\nCurrent models and services include Gemini (formerly Bard), ChatGPT, Grok, Claude, Copilot, and LLaMA.[126] Multimodal GPT models can process different types of data (modalities) such as images, videos, sound, and text.[127]\nHardware and software\nIn the late 2010s, graphics processing units (GPUs) that were increasingly designed with AI-specific enhancements and used with specialized TensorFlow software had replaced previously used central processing unit (CPUs) as the dominant means for large-scale (commercial and academic) machine learning models' training.[128] Specialized programming languages such as Prolog were used in early AI research,[129] but general-purpose programming languages like Python have become predominant.[130]\nThe transistor density in integrated circuits has been observed to roughly double every 18 months—a trend known as Moore's law, named after the Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, who first identified it. Improvements in GPUs have been even faster,[131] a trend sometimes called Huang's law,[132] named after Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang.\nApplications\nAI and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s, including: search engines (such as Google Search), targeting online advertisements, recommendation systems (offered by Netflix, YouTube or Amazon), driving internet traffic, targeted advertising (AdSense, Facebook), virtual assistants (such as Siri or Alexa), autonomous vehicles (including drones, ADAS and self-driving cars), automatic language translation (Microsoft Translator, Google Translate), facial recognition (Apple's FaceID or Microsoft's DeepFace and Google's FaceNet) and image labeling (used by Facebook, Apple's Photos and TikTok). The deployment of AI may be overseen by a Chief automation officer (CAO).\nHealth and medicine\nThe application of AI in medicine and medical research has the potential to increase patient care and quality of life.[133] Through the lens of the Hippocratic Oath, medical professionals are ethically compelled to use AI, if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients.[134][135]\nFor medical research, AI is an important tool for processing and integrating big data. This is particularly important for organoid and tissue engineering development which use microscopy imaging as a key technique in fabrication.[136] It has been suggested that AI can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research.[136][137] New AI tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically relevant pathways. For example, AlphaFold 2 (2021) demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3D structure of a protein.[138] In 2023, it was reported that AI-guided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drug-resistant bacteria.[139] In 2024, researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for Parkinson's disease drug treatments. Their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping, or aggregation, of alpha-synuclein (the protein that characterises Parkinson's disease). They were able to speed up the initial screening process ten-fold and reduce the cost by a thousand-fold.[140][141]\nGames\nGame playing programs have been used since the 1950s to demonstrate and test AI's most advanced techniques.[142] Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997.[143] In 2011, in a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM's question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin.[144] In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol, becoming the first computer Go-playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps. Then, in 2017, it defeated Ke Jie, who was the best Go player in the world.[145] Other programs handle imperfect-information games, such as the poker-playing program Pluribus.[146] DeepMind developed increasingly generalistic reinforcement learning models, such as with MuZero, which could be trained to play chess, Go, or Atari games.[147] In 2019, DeepMind's AlphaStar achieved grandmaster level in StarCraft II, a particularly challenging real-time strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map.[148] In 2021, an AI agent competed in a PlayStation Gran Turismo competition, winning against four of the world's best Gran Turismo drivers using deep reinforcement learning.[149] In 2024, Google DeepMind introduced SIMA, a type of AI capable of autonomously playing nine previously unseen open-world video games by observing screen output, as well as executing short, specific tasks in response to natural language instructions.[150]\nMathematics\nLarge language models, such as GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, LLaMa or Mistral, are increasingly used in mathematics. These probabilistic models are versatile, but can also produce wrong answers in the form of hallucinations. They sometimes need a large database of mathematical problems to learn from, but also methods such as supervised fine-tuning[151] or trained classifiers with human-annotated data to improve answers for new problems and learn from corrections.[152] A February 2024 study showed that the performance of some language models for reasoning capabilities in solving math problems not included in their training data was low, even for problems with only minor deviations from trained data.[153] One technique to improve their performance involves training the models to produce correct reasoning steps, rather than just the correct result.[154] The Alibaba Group developed a version of its Qwen models called Qwen2-Math, that achieved state-of-the-art performance on several mathematical benchmarks, including 84% accuracy on the MATH dataset of competition mathematics problems.[155] In January 2025, Microsoft proposed the technique rStar-Math that leverages Monte Carlo tree search and step-by-step reasoning, enabling a relatively small language model like Qwen-7B to solve 53% of the AIME 2024 and 90% of the MATH benchmark problems.[156]\nAlternatively, dedicated models for mathematical problem solving with higher precision for the outcome including proof of theorems have been developed such as AlphaTensor, AlphaGeometry and AlphaProof all from Google DeepMind,[157] Llemma from EleutherAI[158] or Julius.[159]\nWhen natural language is used to describe mathematical problems, converters can transform such prompts into a formal language such as Lean to define mathematical tasks.\nSome models have been developed to solve challenging problems and reach good results in benchmark tests, others to serve as educational tools in mathematics.[160]\nTopological deep learning integrates various topological approaches.\nFinance\nFinance is one of the fastest growing sectors where applied AI tools are being deployed: from retail online banking to investment advice and insurance, where automated \"robot advisers\" have been in use for some years.[161]\nAccording to Nicolas Firzli, director of the World Pensions & Investments Forum, it may be too early to see the emergence of highly innovative AI-informed financial products and services. He argues that \"the deployment of AI tools will simply further automatise things: destroying tens of thousands of jobs in banking, financial planning, and pension advice in the process, but I'm not sure it will unleash a new wave of [e.g., sophisticated] pension innovation.\"[162]\nMilitary\nVarious countries are deploying AI military applications.[163] The main applications enhance command and control, communications, sensors, integration and interoperability.[164] Research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles.[163] AI technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions, target acquisition, coordination and deconfliction of distributed Joint Fires between networked combat vehicles, both human operated and autonomous.[164]\nAI has been used in military operations in Iraq, Syria, Israel and Ukraine.[163][165][166][167]\nGenerative AI\nGenerative artificial intelligence (Generative AI, GenAI,[168] or GAI) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that uses generative models to produce text, images, videos, or other forms of data.[169][170][171] These models learn the underlying patterns and structures of their training data and use them to produce new data[172][173] based on the input, which often comes in the form of natural language prompts.[174][175]\nGenerative AI tools have become more common since an \"AI boom\" in the 2020s. This boom was made possible by improvements in transformer-based deep neural networks, particularly large language models (LLMs). Major tools include chatbots such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Copilot, Gemini, Llama, and Grok; text-to-image artificial intelligence image generation systems such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALL-E; and text-to-video AI generators such as Sora.[176][177][178][179] Technology companies developing generative AI include OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, Google, DeepSeek, and Baidu.[174][180][181]\nGenerative AI has raised many ethical questions. It can be used for cybercrime, or to deceive or manipulate people through fake news or deepfakes.[182] Even if used ethically, it may lead to mass replacement of human jobs.[183] The tools themselves have been criticized as violating intellectual property laws, since they are trained on and emulate copyrighted works of art.[184]Agents\nArtificial intelligent (AI) agents are software entities designed to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals. These agents can interact with users, their environment, or other agents. AI agents are used in various applications, including virtual assistants, chatbots, autonomous vehicles, game-playing systems, and industrial robotics. AI agents operate within the constraints of their programming, available computational resources, and hardware limitations. This means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities. In real-world applications, AI agents often face time constraints for decision-making and action execution. Many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms, enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training. Using machine learning, AI agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks.[185][186][187]\nSexuality\nApplications of AI in this domain include AI-enabled menstruation and fertility trackers that analyze user data to offer prediction,[188] AI-integrated sex toys (e.g., teledildonics),[189] AI-generated sexual education content,[190] and AI agents that simulate sexual and romantic partners (e.g., Replika).[191] AI is also used for the production of non-consensual deepfake pornography, raising significant ethical and legal concerns.[192]\nAI technologies have also been used to attempt to identify online gender-based violence and online sexual grooming of minors.[193][194]\nOther industry-specific tasks\nThere are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions. In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported having incorporated \"AI\" in some offerings or processes.[195] A few examples are energy storage, medical diagnosis, military logistics, applications that predict the result of judicial decisions, foreign policy, or supply chain management.\nAI applications for evacuation and disaster management are growing. AI has been used to investigate if and how people evacuated in large scale and small scale evacuations using historical data from GPS, videos or social media. Further, AI can provide real time information on the real time evacuation conditions.[196][197][198]\nIn agriculture, AI has helped farmers identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatments or increasing yield. Agronomists use AI to conduct research and development. AI has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes, monitor soil moisture, operate agricultural robots, conduct predictive analytics, classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests, and save water.\nArtificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications, mainly for \"classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights.\" For example, it is used for discovering exoplanets, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy. Additionally, it could be used for activities in space, such as space exploration, including the analysis of data from space missions, real-time science decisions of spacecraft, space debris avoidance, and more autonomous operation.\nDuring the 2024 Indian elections, US$50 million was spent on authorized AI-generated content, notably by creating deepfakes of allied (including sometimes deceased) politicians to better engage with voters, and by translating speeches to various local languages.[199]\nEthics\nAI has potential benefits and potential risks.[200] AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems: Demis Hassabis of DeepMind hopes to \"solve intelligence, and then use that to solve everything else\".[201] However, as the use of AI has become widespread, several unintended consequences and risks have been identified.[202] In-production systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their AI training processes, especially when the AI algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning.[203]\nRisks and harm\nPrivacy and copyright\nMachine learning algorithms require large amounts of data. The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy, surveillance and copyright.\nAI-powered devices and services, such as virtual assistants and IoT products, continuously collect personal information, raising concerns about intrusive data gathering and unauthorized access by third parties. The loss of privacy is further exacerbated by AI's ability to process and combine vast amounts of data, potentially leading to a surveillance society where individual activities are constantly monitored and analyzed without adequate safeguards or transparency.\nSensitive user data collected may include online activity records, geolocation data, video, or audio.[204] For example, in order to build speech recognition algorithms, Amazon has recorded millions of private conversations and allowed temporary workers to listen to and transcribe some of them.[205] Opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy.[206]\nAI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data, such as data aggregation, de-identification and differential privacy.[207] Since 2016, some privacy experts, such as Cynthia Dwork, have begun to view privacy in terms of fairness. Brian Christian wrote that experts have pivoted \"from the question of 'what they know' to the question of 'what they're doing with it'.\"[208]\nGenerative AI is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works, including in domains such as images or computer code; the output is then used under the rationale of \"fair use\". Experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law; relevant factors may include \"the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work\" and \"the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work\".[209][210] Website owners who do not wish to have their content scraped can indicate it in a \"robots.txt\" file.[211] In 2023, leading authors (including John Grisham and Jonathan Franzen) sued AI companies for using their work to train generative AI.[212][213] Another discussed approach is to envision a separate sui generis system of protection for creations generated by AI to ensure fair attribution and compensation for human authors.[214]\nDominance by tech giants\nThe commercial AI scene is dominated by Big Tech companies such as Alphabet Inc., Amazon, Apple Inc., Meta Platforms, and Microsoft.[215][216][217] Some of these players already own the vast majority of existing cloud infrastructure and computing power from data centers, allowing them to entrench further in the marketplace.[218][219]\nPower needs and environmental impacts\nIn January 2024, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released Electricity 2024, Analysis and Forecast to 2026, forecasting electric power use.[220] This is the first IEA report to make projections for data centers and power consumption for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. The report states that power demand for these uses might double by 2026, with additional electric power usage equal to electricity used by the whole Japanese nation.[221]\nProdigious power consumption by AI is responsible for the growth of fossil fuels use, and might delay closings of obsolete, carbon-emitting coal energy facilities. There is a feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the US, making large technology firms (e.g., Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon) into voracious consumers of electric power. Projected electric consumption is so immense that there is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source. A ChatGPT search involves the use of 10 times the electrical energy as a Google search. The large firms are in haste to find power sources – from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion. The tech firms argue that – in the long view – AI will be eventually kinder to the environment, but they need the energy now. AI makes the power grid more efficient and \"intelligent\", will assist in the growth of nuclear power, and track overall carbon emissions, according to technology firms.[222]\nA 2024 Goldman Sachs Research Paper, AI Data Centers and the Coming US Power Demand Surge, found \"US power demand (is) likely to experience growth not seen in a generation....\" and forecasts that, by 2030, US data centers will consume 8% of US power, as opposed to 3% in 2022, presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means.[223] Data centers' need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid. The Big Tech companies counter that AI can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all.[224]\nIn 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported that big AI companies have begun negotiations with the US nuclear power providers to provide electricity to the data centers. In March 2024 Amazon purchased a Pennsylvania nuclear-powered data center for $650 Million (US).[225] Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said nuclear power is a good option for the data centers.[226]\nIn September 2024, Microsoft announced an agreement with Constellation Energy to re-open the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to provide Microsoft with 100% of all electric power produced by the plant for 20 years. Reopening the plant, which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit 2 reactor in 1979, will require Constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. If approved (this will be the first ever US re-commissioning of a nuclear plant), over 835 megawatts of power – enough for 800,000 homes – of energy will be produced. The cost for re-opening and upgrading is estimated at $1.6 billion (US) and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act.[227] The US government and the state of Michigan are investing almost $2 billion (US) to reopen the Palisades Nuclear reactor on Lake Michigan. Closed since 2022, the plant is planned to be reopened in October 2025. The Three Mile Island facility will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center after Chris Crane, a nuclear proponent and former CEO of Exelon who was responsible for Exelon spinoff of Constellation.[228]\nAfter the last approval in September 2023, Taiwan suspended the approval of data centers north of Taoyuan with a capacity of more than 5 MW in 2024, due to power supply shortages.[229] Taiwan aims to phase out nuclear power by 2025.[229] On the other hand, Singapore imposed a ban on the opening of data centers in 2019 due to electric power, but in 2022, lifted this ban.[229]\nAlthough most nuclear plants in Japan have been shut down after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident, according to an October 2024 Bloomberg article in Japanese, cloud gaming services company Ubitus, in which Nvidia has a stake, is looking for land in Japan near nuclear power plant for a new data center for generative AI.[230] Ubitus CEO Wesley Kuo said nuclear power plants are the most efficient, cheap and stable power for AI.[230]\nOn 1 November 2024, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected an application submitted by Talen Energy for approval to supply some electricity from the nuclear power station Susquehanna to Amazon's data center.[231] According to the Commission Chairman Willie L. Phillips, it is a burden on the electricity grid as well as a significant cost shifting concern to households and other business sectors.[231]\nIn 2025 a report prepared by the International Energy Agency estimated the greenhouse gas emissions from the energy consumption of AI at 180 million tons. By 2035, these emissions could rise to 300-500 million tonnes depending on what measures will be taken. This is below 1.5% of the energy sector emissions. The emissions reduction potential of AI was estimated at 5% of the energy sector emissions, but rebound effects (for example if people will pass from public transport to autonomous cars) can reduce it.[232]\nMisinformation\nYouTube, Facebook and others use recommender systems to guide users to more content. These AI programs were given the goal of maximizing user engagement (that is, the only goal was to keep people watching). The AI learned that users tended to choose misinformation, conspiracy theories, and extreme partisan content, and, to keep them watching, the AI recommended more of it. Users also tended to watch more content on the same subject, so the AI led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation.[233] This convinced many users that the misinformation was true, and ultimately undermined trust in institutions, the media and the government.[234] The AI program had correctly learned to maximize its goal, but the result was harmful to society. After the U.S. election in 2016, major technology companies took some steps to mitigate the problem.[235]\nIn 2022, generative AI began to create images, audio, video and text that are indistinguishable from real photographs, recordings, films, or human writing. It is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create massive amounts of misinformation or propaganda.[236] One such potential malicious use is deepfakes for computational propaganda.[237] AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton expressed concern about AI enabling \"authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates\" on a large scale, among other risks.[238]\nAI researchers at Microsoft, OpenAI, universities and other organisations have suggested using \"personhood credentials\" as a way to overcome online deception enabled by AI models.[239]\nAlgorithmic bias and fairness\nMachine learning applications will be biased[k] if they learn from biased data.[241] The developers may not be aware that the bias exists.[242] Bias can be introduced by the way training data is selected and by the way a model is deployed.[243][241] If a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously harm people (as it can in medicine, finance, recruitment, housing or policing) then the algorithm may cause discrimination.[244] The field of fairness studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases.\nOn June 28, 2015, Google Photos's new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a friend as \"gorillas\" because they were black. The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people,[245] a problem called \"sample size disparity\".[246] Google \"fixed\" this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as a \"gorilla\". Eight years later, in 2023, Google Photos still could not identify a gorilla, and neither could similar products from Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon.[247]\nCOMPAS is a commercial program widely used by U.S. courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist. In 2016, Julia Angwin at ProPublica discovered that COMPAS exhibited racial bias, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants. Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61%, the errors for each race were different—the system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would re-offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re-offend.[248] In 2017, several researchers[l] showed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data.[250]\nA program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature (such as \"race\" or \"gender\"). The feature will correlate with other features (like \"address\", \"shopping history\" or \"first name\"), and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on \"race\" or \"gender\".[251] Moritz Hardt said \"the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesn't work.\"[252]\nCriticism of COMPAS highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make \"predictions\" that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. If an application then uses these predictions as recommendations, some of these \"recommendations\" will likely be racist.[253] Thus, machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past. It is descriptive rather than prescriptive.[m]\nBias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male: among AI engineers, about 4% are black and 20% are women.[246]\nThere are various conflicting definitions and mathematical models of fairness. These notions depend on ethical assumptions, and are influenced by beliefs about society. One broad category is distributive fairness, which focuses on the outcomes, often identifying groups and seeking to compensate for statistical disparities. Representational fairness tries to ensure that AI systems do not reinforce negative stereotypes or render certain groups invisible. Procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome. The most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context, notably the type of AI application and the stakeholders. The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them. Having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many AI ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases, but it may conflict with anti-discrimination laws.[240]\nAt its 2022 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAccT 2022), the Association for Computing Machinery, in Seoul, South Korea, presented and published findings that recommend that until AI and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes, they are unsafe, and the use of self-learning neural networks trained on vast, unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed.[dubious – discuss][255]\nLack of transparency\nMany AI systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions.[256] Particularly with deep neural networks, in which there are a large amount of non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs. But some popular explainability techniques exist.[257]\nIt is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works. There have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests, but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended. For example, a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a ruler as \"cancerous\", because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale.[258] Another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at \"low risk\" of dying from pneumonia. Having asthma is actually a severe risk factor, but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care, they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data. The correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real, but misleading.[259]\nPeople who have been harmed by an algorithm's decision have a right to an explanation.[260] Doctors, for example, are expected to clearly and completely explain to their colleagues the reasoning behind any decision they make. Early drafts of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation in 2016 included an explicit statement that this right exists.[n] Industry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight. Regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real: if the problem has no solution, the tools should not be used.[261]\nDARPA established the XAI (\"Explainable Artificial Intelligence\") program in 2014 to try to solve these problems.[262]\nSeveral approaches aim to address the transparency problem. SHAP enables to visualise the contribution of each feature to the output.[263] LIME can locally approximate a model's outputs with a simpler, interpretable model.[264] Multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification. These other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned.[265] Deconvolution, DeepDream and other generative methods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network for computer vision have learned, and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning.[266] For generative pre-trained transformers, Anthropic developed a technique based on dictionary learning that associates patterns of neuron activations with human-understandable concepts.[267]\nBad actors and weaponized AI\nArtificial intelligence provides a number of tools that are useful to bad actors, such as authoritarian governments, terrorists, criminals or rogue states.\nA lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates, selects and engages human targets without human supervision.[o] Widely available AI tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous weapons and, if produced at scale, they are potentially weapons of mass destruction.[269] Even when used in conventional warfare, they currently cannot reliably choose targets and could potentially kill an innocent person.[269] In 2014, 30 nations (including China) supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the United Nations' Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, however the United States and others disagreed.[270] By 2015, over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots.[271]\nAI tools make it easier for authoritarian governments to efficiently control their citizens in several ways. Face and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance. Machine learning, operating this data, can classify potential enemies of the state and prevent them from hiding. Recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect. Deepfakes and generative AI aid in producing misinformation. Advanced AI can make authoritarian centralized decision making more competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such as markets. It lowers the cost and difficulty of digital warfare and advanced spyware.[272] All these technologies have been available since 2020 or earlier—AI facial recognition systems are already being used for mass surveillance in China.[273][274]\nThere many other ways that AI is expected to help bad actors, some of which can not be foreseen. For example, machine-learning AI is able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours.[275]\nTechnological unemployment\nEconomists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI, and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment.[276]\nIn the past, technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that \"we're in uncharted territory\" with AI.[277] A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment, but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed.[278] Risk estimates vary; for example, in the 2010s, Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey estimated 47% of U.S. jobs are at \"high risk\" of potential automation, while an OECD report classified only 9% of U.S. jobs as \"high risk\".[p][280] The methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation, and for implying that technology, rather than social policy, creates unemployment, as opposed to redundancies.[276] In April 2023, it was reported that 70% of the jobs for Chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence.[281][282]\nUnlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; The Economist stated in 2015 that \"the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution\" is \"worth taking seriously\".[283] Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy.[284]\nFrom the early days of the development of artificial intelligence, there have been arguments, for example, those put forward by Joseph Weizenbaum, about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative calculation and qualitative, value-based judgement.[285]\nExistential risk\nIt has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it. This could, as physicist Stephen Hawking stated, \"spell the end of the human race\".[286] This scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like \"self-awareness\" (or \"sentience\" or \"consciousness\") and becomes a malevolent character.[q] These sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways.\nFirst, AI does not require human-like sentience to be an existential risk. Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. Philosopher Nick Bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it (he used the example of a paperclip factory manager).[288] Stuart Russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning that \"you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead.\"[289] In order to be safe for humanity, a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanity's morality and values so that it is \"fundamentally on our side\".[290]\nSecond, Yuval Noah Harari argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk. The essential parts of civilization are not physical. Things like ideologies, law, government, money and the economy are built on language; they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe. The current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an AI could use language to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive.[291]\nThe opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI.[292] Personalities such as Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk,[293] as well as AI pioneers such as Yoshua Bengio, Stuart Russell, Demis Hassabis, and Sam Altman, have expressed concerns about existential risk from AI.\nIn May 2023, Geoffrey Hinton announced his resignation from Google in order to be able to \"freely speak out about the risks of AI\" without \"considering how this impacts Google\".[294] He notably mentioned risks of an AI takeover,[295] and stressed that in order to avoid the worst outcomes, establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of AI.[296]\nIn 2023, many leading AI experts endorsed the joint statement that \"Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war\".[297]\nSome other researchers were more optimistic. AI pioneer Jürgen Schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement, emphasising that in 95% of all cases, AI research is about making \"human lives longer and healthier and easier.\"[298] While the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors, \"they can also be used against the bad actors.\"[299][300] Andrew Ng also argued that \"it's a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on AI—and that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests.\"[301] Yann LeCun \"scoffs at his peers' dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even, eventually, human extinction.\"[302] In the early 2010s, experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine.[303] However, after 2016, the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research.[304]\nEthical machines and alignment\nFriendly AI are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans. Eliezer Yudkowsky, who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk.[305]\nMachines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. The field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas.[306] The field of machine ethics is also called computational morality,[306] and was founded at an AAAI symposium in 2005.[307]\nOther approaches include Wendell Wallach's \"artificial moral agents\"[308] and Stuart J. Russell's three principles for developing provably beneficial machines.[309]\nOpen source\nActive organizations in the AI open-source community include Hugging Face,[310] Google,[311] EleutherAI and Meta.[312] Various AI models, such as Llama 2, Mistral or Stable Diffusion, have been made open-weight,[313][314] meaning that their architecture and trained parameters (the \"weights\") are publicly available. Open-weight models can be freely fine-tuned, which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own use-case.[315] Open-weight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused. Since they can be fine-tuned, any built-in security measure, such as objecting to harmful requests, can be trained away until it becomes ineffective. Some researchers warn that future AI models may develop dangerous capabilities (such as the potential to drastically facilitate bioterrorism) and that once released on the Internet, they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed. They recommend pre-release audits and cost-benefit analyses.[316]\nFrameworks\nArtificial Intelligence projects can be guided by ethical considerations during the design, development, and implementation of an AI system. An AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework, developed by the Alan Turing Institute and based on the SUM values, outlines four main ethical dimensions, defined as follows:[317][318]\n- Respect the dignity of individual people\n- Connect with other people sincerely, openly, and inclusively\n- Care for the wellbeing of everyone\n- Protect social values, justice, and the public interest\nOther developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the Asilomar Conference, the Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI, and the IEEE's Ethics of Autonomous Systems initiative, among others;[319] however, these principles are not without criticism, especially regards to the people chosen to contribute to these frameworks.[320]\nPromotion of the wellbeing of the people and communities that these technologies affect requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of AI system design, development and implementation, and collaboration between job roles such as data scientists, product managers, data engineers, domain experts, and delivery managers.[321]\nThe UK AI Safety Institute released in 2024 a testing toolset called 'Inspect' for AI safety evaluations available under a MIT open-source licence which is freely available on GitHub and can be improved with third-party packages. It can be used to evaluate AI models in a range of areas including core knowledge, ability to reason, and autonomous capabilities.[322]\nRegulation\nThe regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating AI; it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms.[323] The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally.[324] According to AI Index at Stanford, the annual number of AI-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone.[325][326] Between 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI.[327] Most EU member states had released national AI strategies, as had Canada, China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, U.S., and Vietnam. Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia.[327] The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology.[327] Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, and Daniel Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI.[328] In 2023, OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years.[329] In 2023, the United Nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on AI governance; the body comprises technology company executives, governments officials and academics.[330] In 2024, the Council of Europe created the first international legally binding treaty on AI, called the \"Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law\". It was adopted by the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and other signatories.[331]\nIn a 2022 Ipsos survey, attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country; 78% of Chinese citizens, but only 35% of Americans, agreed that \"products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks\".[325] A 2023 Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 61% of Americans agree, and 22% disagree, that AI poses risks to humanity.[332] In a 2023 Fox News poll, 35% of Americans thought it \"very important\", and an additional 41% thought it \"somewhat important\", for the federal government to regulate AI, versus 13% responding \"not very important\" and 8% responding \"not at all important\".[333][334]\nIn November 2023, the first global AI Safety Summit was held in Bletchley Park in the UK to discuss the near and far term risks of AI and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks.[335] 28 countries including the United States, China, and the European Union issued a declaration at the start of the summit, calling for international co-operation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence.[336][337] In May 2024 at the AI Seoul Summit, 16 global AI tech companies agreed to safety commitments on the development of AI.[338][339]\nHistory\nThe study of mechanical or \"formal\" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as \"0\" and \"1\", could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning.[341][342] This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics, information theory and neurobiology, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an \"electronic brain\".[r] They developed several areas of research that would become part of AI,[344] such as McCullouch and Pitts design for \"artificial neurons\" in 1943,[116] and Turing's influential 1950 paper 'Computing Machinery and Intelligence', which introduced the Turing test and showed that \"machine intelligence\" was plausible.[345][342]\nThe field of AI research was founded at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956.[s][6] The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s.[t] They and their students produced programs that the press described as \"astonishing\":[u] computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English.[v][7] Artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and U.S. universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s.[342]\nResearchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine with general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field.[349] In 1965 Herbert Simon predicted, \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do\".[350] In 1967 Marvin Minsky agreed, writing that \"within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved\".[351] They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem.[w] In 1974, both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill[353] and ongoing pressure from the U.S. Congress to fund more productive projects.[354] Minsky's and Papert's book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether.[355] The \"AI winter\", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed.[9]\nIn the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems,[356] a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research.[8] However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began.[10]\nUp to this point, most of AI's funding had gone to projects that used high-level symbols to represent mental objects like plans, goals, beliefs, and known facts. In the 1980s, some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition,[357] and began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches.[358] Rodney Brooks rejected \"representation\" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive.[x] Judea Pearl, Lofti Zadeh, and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic.[87][363] But the most important development was the revival of \"connectionism\", including neural network research, by Geoffrey Hinton and others.[364] In 1990, Yann LeCun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits, the first of many successful applications of neural networks.[365]\nAI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems. This \"narrow\" and \"formal\" focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields (such as statistics, economics and mathematics).[366] By 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as \"artificial intelligence\" (a tendency known as the AI effect).[367] However, several academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. Beginning around 2002, they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence (or \"AGI\"), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s.[68]\nDeep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field.[11] For many specific tasks, other methods were abandoned.[y] Deep learning's success was based on both hardware improvements (faster computers,[369] graphics processing units, cloud computing[370]) and access to large amounts of data[371] (including curated datasets,[370] such as ImageNet). Deep learning's success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI.[z] The amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015–2019.[327]\nIn 2016, issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers re-focussed their careers on these issues. The alignment problem became a serious field of academic study.[304]\nIn the late 2010s and early 2020s, AGI companies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest. In 2015, AlphaGo, developed by DeepMind, beat the world champion Go player. The program taught only the game's rules and developed a strategy by itself. GPT-3 is a large language model that was released in 2020 by OpenAI and is capable of generating high-quality human-like text.[372] ChatGPT, launched on November 30, 2022, became the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months.[373] It marked what is widely regarded as AI's breakout year, bringing it into the public consciousness.[374] These programs, and others, inspired an aggressive AI boom, where large companies began investing billions of dollars in AI research. According to AI Impacts, about $50 billion annually was invested in \"AI\" around 2022 in the U.S. alone and about 20% of the new U.S. Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in \"AI\".[375] About 800,000 \"AI\"-related U.S. job openings existed in 2022.[376] According to PitchBook research, 22% of newly funded startups in 2024 claimed to be AI companies.[377]\nPhilosophy\nPhilosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make intelligent machines.[378] Another major focus has been whether machines can be conscious, and the associated ethical implications.[379] Many other topics in philosophy are relevant to AI, such as epistemology and free will.[380] Rapid advancements have intensified public discussions on the philosophy and ethics of AI.[379]\nDefining artificial intelligence\nAlan Turing wrote in 1950 \"I propose to consider the question 'can machines think'?\"[381] He advised changing the question from whether a machine \"thinks\", to \"whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour\".[381] He devised the Turing test, which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation.[345] Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is \"actually\" thinking or literally has a \"mind\". Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but \"it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks.\"[382]\nRussell and Norvig agree with Turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior, not internal structure.[1] However, they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans. \"Aeronautical engineering texts\", they wrote, \"do not define the goal of their field as making 'machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons.'\"[384] AI founder John McCarthy agreed, writing that \"Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence\".[385]\nMcCarthy defines intelligence as \"the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world\".[386] Another AI founder, Marvin Minsky, similarly describes it as \"the ability to solve hard problems\".[387] The leading AI textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.[1] These definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the \"intelligence\" of the machine—and no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible.\nAnother definition has been adopted by Google,[388] a major practitioner in the field of AI. This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence.\nSome authors have suggested in practice, that the definition of AI is vague and difficult to define, with contention as to whether classical algorithms should be categorised as AI,[389] with many companies during the early 2020s AI boom using the term as a marketing buzzword, often even if they did \"not actually use AI in a material way\".[390]\nEvaluating approaches to AI\nNo established unifying theory or paradigm has guided AI research for most of its history.[aa] The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to mean \"machine learning with neural networks\"). This approach is mostly sub-symbolic, soft and narrow. Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers.\nSymbolic AI and its limits\nSymbolic AI (or \"GOFAI\")[392] simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at \"intelligent\" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis: \"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.\"[393]\nHowever, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning. Moravec's paradox is the discovery that high-level \"intelligent\" tasks were easy for AI, but low level \"instinctive\" tasks were extremely difficult.[394] Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a \"feel\" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge.[395] Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree with him.[ab][16]\nThe issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as algorithmic bias. Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence,[397][398] in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI: it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision. The emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches.\nNeat vs. scruffy\n\"Neats\" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic, optimization, or neural networks). \"Scruffies\" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work. This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s,[399] but eventually was seen as irrelevant. Modern AI has elements of both.\nSoft vs. hard computing\nFinding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems.[15] Soft computing is a set of techniques, including genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic and neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks.\nNarrow vs. general AI\nAI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field's long-term goals.[400][401] General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions. The sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively.\nMachine consciousness, sentience, and mind\nThe philosophy of mind does not know whether a machine can have a mind, consciousness and mental states, in the same sense that human beings do. This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence. Russell and Norvig add that \"[t]he additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on.\"[402] However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind. It is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction.\nConsciousness\nDavid Chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the \"hard\" and \"easy\" problems of consciousness.[403] The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennett's consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion). While human information processing is easy to explain, human subjective experience is difficult to explain. For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like.[404]\nComputationalism and functionalism\nComputationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind–body problem. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam.[405]\nPhilosopher John Searle characterized this position as \"strong AI\": \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\"[ac] Searle challenges this claim with his Chinese room argument, which attempts to show that even a computer capable of perfectly simulating human behavior would not have a mind.[409]\nAI welfare and rights\nIt is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced AI is sentient (has the ability to feel), and if so, to what degree.[410] But if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer, then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures, similarly to animals.[411][412] Sapience (a set of capacities related to high intelligence, such as discernment or self-awareness) may provide another moral basis for AI rights.[411] Robot rights are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society.[413]\nIn 2017, the European Union considered granting \"electronic personhood\" to some of the most capable AI systems. Similarly to the legal status of companies, it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities.[414] Critics argued in 2018 that granting rights to AI systems would downplay the importance of human rights, and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios. They also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part to society on their own.[415][416]\nProgress in AI increased interest in the topic. Proponents of AI welfare and rights often argue that AI sentience, if it emerges, would be particularly easy to deny. They warn that this may be a moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming, which could lead to large-scale suffering if sentient AI is created and carelessly exploited.[412][411]\nFuture\nSuperintelligence and the singularity\nA superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind.[401] If research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself. The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to what I. J. Good called an \"intelligence explosion\" and Vernor Vinge called a \"singularity\".[417]\nHowever, technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely, and typically follow an S-shaped curve, slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do.[418]\nTranshumanism\nRobot designer Hans Moravec, cyberneticist Kevin Warwick and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in the writings of Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger.[419]\nEdward Fredkin argues that \"artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution\", an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler's \"Darwin among the Machines\" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by George Dyson in his 1998 book Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence.[420]\nDecomputing\nArguments for decomputing have been raised by Dan McQuillan (Resisting AI: An Anti-fascist Approach to Artificial Intelligence, 2022), meaning an opposition to the sweeping application and expansion of artificial intelligence. Similar to degrowth, the approach criticizes AI as an outgrowth of the systemic issues and capitalist world we live in. It argues that a different future is possible, in which distance between people is reduced rather than increased through AI intermediaries.[421]\nIn fiction\nThought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity,[422] and have been a persistent theme in science fiction.[423]\nA common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. This includes such works as Arthur C. Clarke's and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (both 1968), with HAL 9000, the murderous computer in charge of the Discovery One spaceship, as well as The Terminator (1984) and The Matrix (1999). In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and Bishop from Aliens (1986) are less prominent in popular culture.[424]\nIsaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many stories, most notably with the \"Multivac\" super-intelligent computer. Asimov's laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics;[425] while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov's laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity.[426]\nSeveral works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel, and thus to suffer. This appears in Karel Čapek's R.U.R., the films A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina, as well as the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, by Philip K. Dick. Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence.[427]\nSee also\n- Artificial consciousness – Field in cognitive science\n- Artificial intelligence and elections – Use and impact of AI on political elections\n- Artificial intelligence content detection – Software to detect AI-generated content\n- Behavior selection algorithm – Algorithm that selects actions for intelligent agents\n- Business process automation – Automation of business processes\n- Case-based reasoning – Process of solving new problems based on the solutions of similar past problems\n- Computational intelligence – Ability of a computer to learn a specific task from data or experimental observation\n- Digital immortality – Hypothetical concept of storing a personality in digital form\n- Emergent algorithm – Algorithm exhibiting emergent behavior\n- Female gendering of AI technologies – Gender biases in digital technology\n- Glossary of artificial intelligence – List of definitions of terms and concepts commonly used in the study of artificial intelligence\n- Intelligence amplification – Use of information technology to augment human intelligence\n- Intelligent agent – Software agent which acts autonomously\n- Intelligent automation – Software process that combines robotic process automation and artificial intelligence\n- Mind uploading – Hypothetical process of digitally emulating a brain\n- Organoid intelligence – Use of brain cells and brain organoids for intelligent computing\n- Robotic process automation – Form of business process automation technology\n- The Last Day – 1967 Welsh science fiction novel\n- Wetware computer – Computer composed of organic material\n- DARWIN EU - A European Union initiative coordinated by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to generate and utilize real-world evidence (RWE) to support the evaluation and supervision of medicines across the EU.\nExplanatory notes\n- ^ a b This list of intelligent traits is based on the topics covered by the major AI textbooks, including: Russell & Norvig (2021), Luger & Stubblefield (2004), Poole, Mackworth & Goebel (1998) and Nilsson (1998)\n- ^ a b This list of tools is based on the topics covered by the major AI textbooks, including: Russell & Norvig (2021), Luger & Stubblefield (2004), Poole, Mackworth & Goebel (1998) and Nilsson (1998)\n- ^ It is among the reasons that expert systems proved to be inefficient for capturing knowledge.[30][31]\n- ^ \"Rational agent\" is general term used in economics, philosophy and theoretical artificial intelligence.

          "content": "artificial intelligence\nWhat is artificial intelligence?\nAre artificial intelligence and machine learning the same?\nNews •\nartificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Since their development in the 1940s, digital computers have been programmed to carry out very complex tasks—such as discovering proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chess—with great proficiency. Despite continuing advances in computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are as yet no programs that can match full human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge. On the other hand, some programs have attained the performance levels of human experts and professionals in executing certain specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is found in applications as diverse as medical diagnosis, computer search engines, voice or handwriting recognition, and chatbots.\nWhat is intelligence?\nAll but the simplest human behavior is ascribed to intelligence, while even the most complicated insect behavior is usually not taken as an indication of intelligence. What is the difference? Consider the behavior of the digger wasp, Sphex ichneumoneus. When the female wasp returns to her burrow with food, she first deposits it on the threshold, checks for intruders inside her burrow, and only then, if the coast is clear, carries her food inside. The real nature of the wasp’s instinctual behavior is revealed if the food is moved a few inches away from the entrance to her burrow while she is inside: on emerging, she will repeat the whole procedure as often as the food is displaced. Intelligence—conspicuously absent in the case of the wasp—must include the ability to adapt to new circumstances.\nPsychologists generally characterize human intelligence not by just one trait but by the combination of many diverse abilities. Research in AI has focused chiefly on the following components of intelligence: learning, reasoning, problem solving, perception, and using language.\nLearning\nThere are a number of different forms of learning as applied to artificial intelligence. The simplest is learning by trial and error. For example, a simple computer program for solving mate-in-one chess problems might try moves at random until mate is found. The program might then store the solution with the position so that, the next time the computer encountered the same position, it would recall the solution. This simple memorizing of individual items and procedures—known as rote learning—is relatively easy to implement on a computer. More challenging is the problem of implementing what is called generalization. Generalization involves applying past experience to analogous new situations. For example, a program that learns the past tense of regular English verbs by rote will not be able to produce the past tense of a word such as jump unless the program was previously presented with jumped, whereas a program that is able to generalize can learn the “add -ed” rule for regular verbs ending in a consonant and so form the past tense of jump on the basis of experience with similar verbs.\n(Read Ray Kurzweil’s Britannica essay on the future of “Nonbiological Man.”)",

          "content": "A.I. Artificial Intelligence\nA.I. Artificial Intelligence (or simply A.I.) is a 2001 American science fiction drama film directed by Steven Spielberg. The screenplay by Spielberg and screen story by Ian Watson are loosely based on the 1969 short story \"Supertoys Last All Summer Long\" by Brian Aldiss. Set in a futuristic society, the film stars Haley Joel Osment as David, a childlike android uniquely programmed with the ability to love. Jude Law, Frances O'Connor, Brendan Gleeson and William Hurt star in supporting roles.\nDevelopment of A.I. originally began after producer and director Stanley Kubrick acquired the rights to Aldiss's story in the early 1970s. Kubrick hired a series of writers, including Aldiss, Bob Shaw, Ian Watson and Sara Maitland, until the mid-1990s. The film languished in development hell for years, partly because Kubrick felt that computer-generated imagery was not advanced enough to create the David character, which he believed no child actor would convincingly portray. In 1995, Kubrick handed A.I. to Spielberg, but the film did not gain momentum until Kubrick died in 1999. Spielberg remained close to Watson's treatment for the screenplay and dedicated the film to Kubrick.\nA.I. Artificial Intelligence was released on June 29, 2001, by Warner Bros. Pictures in North America. It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $235.9 million against a budget of $90–100 million. It was also nominated for Best Visual Effects and Best Original Score (for John Williams) at the 74th Academy Awards. In a 2016 BBC poll of 177 critics around the world, A.I. Artificial Intelligence was voted the eighty-third greatest film since 2000. It has since been called one of Spielberg's best works and one of the greatest films of the 21st century, and of all time.[4][5][6][7][8]\nPlot\n[edit]In the 22nd century, rising sea levels from global warming have wiped out coastal cities and altered the world's climate. With the human population in decline, advanced nations have created humanoid robots called mechas to fulfill various roles in society.\nIn Madison, New Jersey, David, an 11-year-old prototype mecha child capable of experiencing love, is given to Henry Swinton and his wife Monica, whose son Martin is in suspended animation after contracting a rare disease. Initially uncomfortable with David, Monica eventually warms to him and activates his imprinting protocol. Wanting her to love him in return, he befriends Teddy, Martin's old robotic teddy bear.\nAfter Martin is unexpectedly cured of his disease and brought home, he jealously goads David into cutting off a piece of Monica's hair. That night, David enters his adoptive parents' room, but as Monica turns over, the scissors accidentally poke her in the eye. While Henry attends to her wounds, Teddy picks up the lock of hair from the floor and places it in his pocket. During a pool party, one of Martin's friends pokes David with a knife, triggering his self-protection programming. David grabs Martin, causing both of them to fall into the pool. While Martin is rescued, David is accused of endangering others.\nHenry convinces Monica to return David to his creators for destruction. En route, she instead spares David by abandoning him in the woods full of scrap metal and obsolete mechas. Now accompanied solely by Teddy, David recalls The Adventures of Pinocchio and decides to find the Blue Fairy to become human, which he believes will regain Monica's love.\nDavid and Teddy are captured by the \"Flesh Fair\", a traveling circus-like event at which obsolete mechas are destroyed in front of jeering crowds. About to be destroyed himself, David pleads for his life, and the audience revolts and allows David to escape with Gigolo Joe, a prostitute mecha on the run after being framed for murder. David, Teddy and Joe go to the decadent resort town of Rouge City, where \"Dr. Know\", a holographic answer engine, directs them to the top of Rockefeller Center in the flooded ruins of New York City and provides fairy tale information that David interprets as suggesting that a Blue Fairy can help him.\nAbove the ruins of New York, David meets Professor Hobby, his creator, who tells him that their meeting demonstrates David's ability to love and desire. David finds copies of himself, including female variants called \"Darlene\", ready to be shipped. Disheartened by his lost sense of individuality, David attempts suicide by falling from a skyscraper into the ocean. While underwater, David notices a figure resembling the Blue Fairy before Joe rescues him in an amphibious aircraft. Before David can explain, authorities capture Joe with an electromagnet. David and Teddy take control of the aircraft to see the Blue Fairy, which turns out to be a statue from an attraction on Coney Island. The two become trapped when the Wonder Wheel falls on their vehicle. Believing that the Blue Fairy is real, David repeatedly asks the statue to turn him into a real boy until his power source is depleted.\nTwo thousand years later, humanity is extinct and Manhattan is buried under glacial ice. Mechas have evolved into an advanced form, and a group known as the Specialists, interested in humanity, find and resurrect David and Teddy. They reconstruct the Swinton family home from David's memories before explaining, via an interactive version of the Blue Fairy, that he cannot become human. However, they recreate Monica through genetic material from the strand of hair that Teddy kept. This version of Monica can live for only one day and cannot be revived. David spends his happiest day with Monica, and as she falls asleep in the evening, Monica tells David that she has always loved him. David lies down next to her and closes his eyes.\nCast\n[edit]- Haley Joel Osment as David. Osment was Spielberg's first and only choice for the role.

In 1985, Kubrick asked Steven Spielberg to direct the film, with Kubrick producing.[12] Warner Bros. agreed to co-finance A.I. and cover distribution duties.[13] The film labored in development hell, and Aldiss was fired by Kubrick over creative differences in 1989.[14] Bob Shaw briefly served as writer, leaving after six weeks due to Kubrick's demanding work schedule, and Ian Watson was hired as the new writer in March 1990. Aldiss later remarked, \"Not only did the bastard fire me, he hired my enemy [Watson] instead.\" Kubrick handed Watson Carlo Collodi's The Adventures of Pinocchio for inspiration, calling A.I. \"a picaresque robot version of Pinocchio\".[13][15][16]\nThree weeks later, Watson gave Kubrick his first story treatment, and concluded his work on A.I. in May 1991 with another treatment of 90 pages. Gigolo Joe was originally conceived as a G.I. mecha, but Watson suggested changing him to a male prostitute. Kubrick joked, \"I guess we lost the kiddie market.\"[13] Meanwhile, Kubrick dropped A.I. to work on a film adaptation of Wartime Lies, feeling computer animation was not advanced enough to create the David character. After the release of Spielberg's Jurassic Park, with its innovative CGI, it was announced in November 1993 that production of A.I. would begin in 1994.[17] Dennis Muren and Ned Gorman, who worked on Jurassic Park, became visual effects supervisors,[14] but Kubrick was displeased with their previsualization, and with the expense of hiring Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) and Stan Winston Studio.[18]\n\"Stanley [Kubrick] showed Steven [Spielberg] 650 drawings which he had, and the script and the story, everything. Stanley said, 'Look, why don't you direct it and I'll produce it.' Steven was almost in shock.\"\nKubrick asked Sara Maitland to give the film mythic resonance. She recalls \"He never referred to the film as 'A.I.'; he always called it 'Pinocchio.'\" Kubrick's version ended the same way Spielberg's does, with advanced mechas reviving Monica, but only for a day.[20]\nPre-production\n[edit]In early 1994, the film was in pre-production with Christopher \"Fangorn\" Baker as concept artist and Sara Maitland assisting on the story, which gave it \"a feminist fairy-tale focus\".[13] Maitland said that Kubrick never referred to the film as A.I., but as Pinocchio.[18] Chris Cunningham became the new visual effects supervisor. Some of his unproduced work for A.I. can be seen on the DVD The Work of Director Chris Cunningham.[21]\nAside from considering computer animation, Kubrick also had Joseph Mazzello do a screen test for the lead role.[18] Cunningham helped assemble a series of \"little robot-type humans\" for the David character. \"We tried to construct a little boy with a movable rubber face to see whether we could make it look appealing,\" producer Jan Harlan reflected. \"But it was a total failure, it looked awful.\" Hans Moravec was brought in as a technical consultant.[18] Meanwhile, Kubrick and Harlan thought that A.I. would be closer to Steven Spielberg's sensibilities as director.[22][23] Kubrick handed the position to Spielberg in 1995, but Spielberg chose to direct other projects and convinced Kubrick to remain as director.[19][24] The film was put on hold due to Kubrick's commitment to Eyes Wide Shut (1999).[25]\nAfter Kubrick's death in March 1999, Harlan and Christiane Kubrick approached Spielberg to take over the director's position.[26][27] By November 1999, Spielberg was writing the screenplay based on Watson's 90-page story treatment. It was his first solo screenplay credit since Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977).[28] Pre-production was briefly halted during February 2000 because Spielberg pondered directing other projects, which were Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Minority Report and Memoirs of a Geisha.[25][29] The following month, Spielberg announced that A.I. would be his next project, with Minority Report as a follow-up.[30] When he decided to fast track A.I., Spielberg brought back Chris Baker as concept artist.[24] Ian Watson reported that the final script was very faithful to Kubrick's vision; even the ending, which is often attributed to Spielberg, saying, \"The final 20 minutes are pretty close to what I wrote for Stanley, and what Stanley wanted, faithfully filmed by Spielberg without added schmaltz\".[31]\nFilming and visual effects\n[edit]The original start date was July 10, 2000,[23] but filming was delayed until August.[32] Aside from a couple of weeks of shooting on location in Oxbow Regional Park in Oregon, A.I. was shot entirely using sound stages at Warner Bros. Studios and the Spruce Goose Dome in Long Beach, California.[33]\nSpielberg copied Kubrick's obsessively secretive approach to filmmaking by refusing to give the complete script to cast and crew, banning press from the set, and making actors sign confidentiality agreements. For instance, Jack Angel, who voiced Teddy, recorded his lines entirely out of context, only receiving direction to sound like Eeyore from Winnie the Pooh, except \"very wise and old and stoic\". However, Spielberg asked Angel to be on the set every day to make line alterations wherever he felt necessary.[34] Social robotics expert Cynthia Breazeal served as technical consultant during production.[23][35] Costume designer Bob Ringwood studied pedestrians on the Las Vegas Strip for his influence on the Rouge City extras.[36] Visual effects, such as removing the visible rods controlling Teddy and removing Haley Joel Osment's breath, were provided in-houses by PDI/DreamWorks.[37]\nCasting\n[edit]Julianne Moore and Gwyneth Paltrow were considered for the role of Monica Swinton before Frances O'Connor was cast. Jerry Seinfeld was originally considered to voice and play the Comedian Robot before Chris Rock was cast.[38]\nAllusions\n[edit]A. O. Scott notes Spielberg's homages to Kubrick, \"sly references to A Clockwork Orange, The Shining and predominantly 2001: A Space Odyssey\" as well as Collodi's Pinocchio.[39] The lines Dr. Know quotes are from W. B. Yeats's \"The Stolen Child\":\nCome away, O human child!\nTo the waters and the wild\nWith a faery, hand in hand,\nFor the world’s more full of weeping\nthan you can understand.[40]\nSoundtrack\n[edit]The film's soundtrack album was released by Warner Sunset Records in 2001. The original score was composed and conducted by John Williams and features singers Lara Fabian on two songs and Josh Groban on one. The film's score also had a limited release as an official \"For your consideration Academy Promo\", as well as a complete score issued by La-La Land Records in 2015.[41] The band Ministry appears in the film playing the song \"What About Us?\", but the song does not appear on the official soundtrack album.\nWilliams called his score an \"homage a Kubrick.\" He includes echoes of Gyorgy Ligeti's choral music, which Kubrick used in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Per Kubrick's request, Williams included a quotation of Richard Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier in his score.[42]\nRelease\n[edit]Marketing\n[edit]The teaser trailer debuted on December 8, 2000, with the theatrical release of Proof of Life.[43] Warner Bros. used an alternate reality game titled The Beast to promote the film. Over forty websites were created by Atomic Pictures in New York City (kept online at Cloudmakers.org), including the website for Cybertronics Corp. There were to be a series of video games for the Xbox video game console that followed the storyline of The Beast, but they went undeveloped. To avoid audiences mistaking A.I. for a family film, no action figures were created, although Hasbro released a talking Teddy following the film's release in June 2001.[23]\nA.I. premiered at the Venice Film Festival in 2001.[44]\nHome media\n[edit]A.I. Artificial Intelligence was released on VHS and DVD in the United States by DreamWorks Home Entertainment and Touchstone Home Video on March 5, 2002[45][46] in widescreen and fullscreen two-disc special editions featuring an extensive sixteen-part documentary detailing the film's development, production, visual effects, sound design and music. The bonuses also include interviews with Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law, Frances O'Connor, Steven Spielberg and John Williams, two teaser trailers for the film's original theatrical release, and an extensive photo gallery featuring production stills and Stanley Kubrick's original storyboards.[47] It was released overseas by Warner Home Video.\nThe film was released on Blu-ray in Japan by Warner Home Video on December 22, 2010, followed shortly by a United States release by Paramount Home Entertainment and Touchstone Home Entertainment (owners of the pre-2010 DreamWorks catalog) on April 5, 2011. This Blu-ray features the film remastered in high-definition and incorporates all the bonus features previously included on the two-disc special-edition DVD.[48]\nReception\n[edit]Box office\n[edit]The film opened in 3,242 theaters in the United States and Canada on June 29, 2001, earning $29.35 million at #1 during its opening weekend.[49] A.I went on to gross $78.62 million in the United States and Canada. Opening on 524 screens in Japan, A.I. grossed almost two billion Yen in its first five days, the biggest June opening in Japan at the time, and sold more tickets in its opening weekend than Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, although it grossed slightly less.[50] It went on to gross $78 million in Japan.[51] It grossed $79 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $235.93 million.[3]\nCritical response\n[edit]On Rotten Tomatoes, A.I. Artificial Intelligence holds an approval rating of 76% based on reviews from 201 critics, with an average rating of 6.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"A curious, not always seamless, amalgamation of Kubrick's chilly bleakness and Spielberg's warm-hearted optimism. A.I. is, in a word, fascinating.\"[52] On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 65 out of 100 based on reviews from 32 critics, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews\".[53] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C+\" on a scale of A+ to F.[54]\nProducer Jan Harlan stated that Kubrick \"would have applauded\" the final film, while Kubrick's widow Christiane also enjoyed A.I.[55] Brian Aldiss admired the film as well: \"I thought what an inventive, intriguing, ingenious, involving film this was. There are flaws in it and I suppose I might have a personal quibble but it's so long since I wrote it.\" Of the film's ending, he wondered how it might have been had Kubrick directed the film: \"That is one of the 'ifs' of film history—at least the ending indicates Spielberg adding some sugar to Kubrick's wine. The actual ending is overly sympathetic and moreover rather overtly engineered by a plot device that does not really bear credence. But it's a brilliant piece of film and of course it's a phenomenon because it contains the energies and talents of two brilliant filmmakers.\"[56]\nA. O. Scott writes: \"Mr. Spielberg seems to be attempting the improbable feat of melding Kubrick's chilly, analytical style with his own warmer, needier sensibility. He tells the story slowly and films it with lucid, mesmerizing objectivity, creating a mood as layered, dissonant and strange as John Williams's unusually restrained, modernist score.\" He concludes: \"The very end somehow fuses the cathartic comfort of infantile wish fulfillment -- the dream that the first perfect love whose loss we experience as the fall from Eden might be restored -- with a feeling almost too terrible to acknowledge or to name. Refusing to cuddle us or lull us into easy sleep, Mr. Spielberg locates the unspoken moral of all our fairy tales. To be real is to be mortal; to be human is to love, to dream and to perish.\"[39]\nRichard Corliss of Time magazine heavily praised Spielberg's direction, as well as the cast and visual effects.[57]\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of a possible four, saying that it is \"wonderful and maddening\".[58] Ebert later gave the film a full four stars and added it to his \"Great Movies\" canon in 2011.[59]\nLeonard Maltin, on the other hand, gives the film two stars out of four in his Movie Guide, writing, \"[The] intriguing story draws us in, thanks in part to Osment's exceptional performance, but takes several wrong turns; ultimately, it just doesn't work. Spielberg rewrote the adaptation Stanley Kubrick commissioned of the Brian Aldiss short story Super Toys Last All Summer Long; [the] result is a curious and uncomfortable hybrid of Kubrick and Spielberg sensibilities.\" However, Maltin called John Williams's music score \"striking\".\nJonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader compared A.I. to Solaris (1972), and praised both \"Kubrick for proposing that Spielberg direct the project and Spielberg for doing his utmost to respect Kubrick's intentions while making it a profoundly personal work\".[40] In 2009, he described A.I. as \"a very great and deeply misunderstood film\", noting that Andrew Sarris, Stan Brakhage and James Naremore \"more or less\" agreed with this assessment.[60]\nFilm critic Armond White of the New York Press praised the film, noting that \"each part of David's journey through carnal and sexual universes into the final eschatological devastation becomes as profoundly philosophical and contemplative as anything by cinema's most thoughtful, speculative artists – Borzage, Ozu, Demy, Tarkovsky.\"[61]\nFilmmaker Billy Wilder hailed A.I. as \"the most underrated film of the past few years\".[62] When British filmmaker Ken Russell saw the film, he wept during the ending.[63]\nScreenwriter Ian Watson has speculated, \"Worldwide, A.I. was very successful (and the 4th-highest earner of the year) but it didn't do quite so well in America, because the film, so I'm told, was too poetical and intellectual in general for American tastes. Plus, quite a few critics in America misunderstood the film, thinking for instance that the Giacometti-style beings in the final 20 minutes were aliens (whereas they were robots of the future who had evolved themselves from the robots in the earlier part of the film) and also thinking that the final 20 minutes were a sentimental addition by Spielberg, whereas those scenes were exactly what I wrote for Stanley and exactly what he wanted, filmed faithfully by Spielberg.\"[64][note 1]\nMick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave a largely negative review. \"A.I. exhibits all its creators' bad traits and none of the good. So we end up with the structureless, meandering, slow-motion endlessness of Kubrick combined with the fuzzy, cuddly mindlessness of Spielberg.\" Dubbing it Spielberg's \"first boring movie\", LaSalle also believed that the robots at the end of the film were aliens, and compared Gigolo Joe to the \"useless\" Jar Jar Binks, yet praised Robin Williams for his portrayal of a futuristic Albert Einstein.[66][failed verification]\nPeter Travers of Rolling Stone magazine gave a mixed review, concluding, \"Spielberg cannot live up to Kubrick's darker side of the future\", but still put the film on his top ten list that year.[67]\nDavid Denby in The New Yorker criticized A.I. for not adhering closely to his concept of the Pinocchio character.\nSpielberg responded to some of the criticisms of the film, stating that many of the \"so called sentimental\" elements of A.I., including the ending, were in fact Kubrick's, and the darker elements were his own.[68] However, Sara Maitland, who worked on the project with Kubrick in the 1990s, said that Kubrick never started production on A.I. because he had a hard time making the ending work.[69]\nJames Berardinelli found the film \"consistently involving, with moments of near-brilliance, but far from a masterpiece. In fact, as the long-awaited 'collaboration' of Kubrick and Spielberg, it ranks as something of a disappointment.\" Of the film's highly debated finale, he claimed, \"There is no doubt that the concluding 30 minutes are all Spielberg; the outstanding question is where Kubrick's vision left off and Spielberg's began.\"[70]\nJohn Simon of the National Review described A.I. \"as an uneasy mix of trauma and treacle\".[71]\nIn 2002, Spielberg told film critic Joe Leydon, \"People pretend to think they know Stanley Kubrick, and think they know me, when most of them don't know either of us... And what's really funny about that is, all the parts of A.I. that people assume were Stanley's were mine. And all the parts of A.I. that people accuse me of sweetening and softening and sentimentalizing were all Stanley's. The teddy bear was Stanley's. The whole last 20 minutes of the movie was completely Stanley's. The whole first 35, 40 minutes of the film—all the stuff in the house—was word for word, from Stanley's screenplay. This was Stanley's vision... Eighty percent of the critics got it all mixed up. But I could see why. Because, obviously, I've done a lot of movies where people have cried and have been sentimental. And I've been accused of sentimentalizing hard-core material. But in fact it was Stanley who did the sweetest parts of A.I., not me. I'm the guy who did the dark center of the movie, with the Flesh Fair and everything else. That's why he wanted me to make the movie in the first place. He said, 'This is much closer to your sensibilities than my own.'\"[72] Spielberg said, \"While there was divisiveness when A.I. came out, I felt that I had achieved Stanley's wishes, or goals.\"[73]\nOn re-watching the film many years after its release, BBC film critic Mark Kermode apologized to Spielberg in a January 2013 interview for \"getting it wrong\" on the film when he first viewed it in 2001. He came to believe that the film is Spielberg's \"enduring masterpiece\".[74]\nIn March 2025, The New York Times listed A.I. as among \"The Movies We've Loved Since 2000.\"[75]\nAccolades\n[edit]Visual effects supervisors Dennis Muren, Stan Winston, Michael Lantieri and Scott Farrar were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, and John Williams was nominated for Best Original Music Score.[76][77] Steven Spielberg, Jude Law and Williams received nominations at the 59th Golden Globe Awards.[78] A.I. was successful at the Saturn Awards, winning five awards, including Best Science Fiction Film along with Best Writing for Spielberg and Best Performance by a Younger Actor for Osment.[79]\nAmerican Film Institute nominated the film in AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores.[85]\nSee also\n[edit]Notes\n[edit]- ^ Distribution of A.I.

          "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human learning, comprehension, problem solving, decision making, creativity and autonomy.\nApplications and devices equipped with AI can see and identify objects. They can understand and respond to human language. They can learn from new information and experience. They can make detailed recommendations to users and experts. They can act independently, replacing the need for human intelligence or intervention (a classic example being a self-driving car).\nBut in 2024, most AI researchers, practitioners and most AI-related headlines are focused on breakthroughs in generative AI (gen AI), a technology that can create original text, images, video and other content. To fully understand generative AI, it’s important to first understand the technologies on which generative AI tools are built: machine learning (ML) and deep learning.\nIndustry newsletter\nGet curated insights on the most important—and intriguing—AI news.

Refer to our IBM Privacy Statement for more information.\nA simple way to think about AI is as a series of nested or derivative concepts that have emerged over more than 70 years:\nDirectly underneath AI, we have machine learning, which involves creating models by training an algorithm to make predictions or decisions based on data. It encompasses a broad range of techniques that enable computers to learn from and make inferences based on data without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks.\nThere are many types of machine learning techniques or algorithms, including linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, support vector machines (SVMs), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), clustering and more. Each of these approaches is suited to different kinds of problems and data.\nBut one of the most popular types of machine learning algorithm is called a neural network (or artificial neural network). Neural networks are modeled after the human brain's structure and function. A neural network consists of interconnected layers of nodes (analogous to neurons) that work together to process and analyze complex data. Neural networks are well suited to tasks that involve identifying complex patterns and relationships in large amounts of data.\nThe simplest form of machine learning is called supervised learning, which involves the use of labeled data sets to train algorithms to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. In supervised learning, humans pair each training example with an output label. The goal is for the model to learn the mapping between inputs and outputs in the training data, so it can predict the labels of new, unseen data.\nDeep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multilayered neural networks, called deep neural networks, that more closely simulate the complex decision-making power of the human brain.\nDeep neural networks include an input layer, at least three but usually hundreds of hidden layers, and an output layer, unlike neural networks used in classic machine learning models, which usually have only one or two hidden layers.\nThese multiple layers enable unsupervised learning: they can automate the extraction of features from large, unlabeled and unstructured data sets, and make their own predictions about what the data represents.\nBecause deep learning doesn’t require human intervention, it enables machine learning at a tremendous scale. It is well suited to natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and other tasks that involve the fast, accurate identification complex patterns and relationships in large amounts of data. Some form of deep learning powers most of the artificial intelligence (AI) applications in our lives today.\nDeep learning also enables:\nGenerative AI, sometimes called \"gen AI\", refers to deep learning models that can create complex original content such as long-form text, high-quality images, realistic video or audio and more in response to a user’s prompt or request.\nAt a high level, generative models encode a simplified representation of their training data, and then draw from that representation to create new work that’s similar, but not identical, to the original data.\nGenerative models have been used for years in statistics to analyze numerical data. But over the last decade, they evolved to analyze and generate more complex data types. This evolution coincided with the emergence of three sophisticated deep learning model types:\nIn general, generative AI operates in three phases:\nGenerative AI begins with a \"foundation model\"; a deep learning model that serves as the basis for multiple different types of generative AI applications.\nThe most common foundation models today are large language models (LLMs), created for text generation applications. But there are also foundation models for image, video, sound or music generation, and multimodal foundation models that support several kinds of content.\nTo create a foundation model, practitioners train a deep learning algorithm on huge volumes of relevant raw, unstructured, unlabeled data, such as terabytes or petabytes of data text or images or video from the internet. The training yields a neural network of billions of parameters encoded representations of the entities, patterns and relationships in the data that can generate content autonomously in response to prompts. This is the foundation model.\nThis training process is compute-intensive, time-consuming and expensive. It requires thousands of clustered graphics processing units (GPUs) and weeks of processing, all of which typically costs millions of dollars. Open source foundation model projects, such as Meta's Llama-2, enable gen AI developers to avoid this step and its costs.\nNext, the model must be tuned to a specific content generation task. This can be done in various ways, including:\nDevelopers and users regularly assess the outputs of their generative AI apps, and further tune the model even as often as once a week for greater accuracy or relevance. In contrast, the foundation model itself is updated much less frequently, perhaps every year or 18 months.\nAnother option for improving a gen AI app's performance is retrieval augmented generation (RAG), a technique for extending the foundation model to use relevant sources outside of the training data to refine the parameters for greater accuracy or relevance.\nAn AI agent is an autonomous AI program, it can perform tasks and accomplish goals on behalf of a user or another system without human intervention, by designing its own workflow and using available tools (other applications or services).\nAgentic AI is a system of multiple AI agents, the efforts of which are coordinated, or orchestrated, to accomplish a more complex task or a greater goal than any single agent in the system could accomplish.\nUnlike chatbots and other AI models which operate within predefined constraints and require human intervention, AI agents and agentic AI exhibit autonomy, goal-driven behavior and adaptability to changing circumstances. The terms “agent” and “agentic” refer to these models’ agency, or their capacity to act independently and purposefully.\nOne way to think of agents is as a natural next step after generative AI. Gen AI models focus on creating content based on learned patterns; agents use that content to interact with each other and other tools to make decisions, solve problems and complete tasks. For example, a gen AI app might be able to tell you the best time to climb Mt. Everest given your work schedule, but an agent can tell you this, and then use an online travel service to book you the best flight and reserve a room in the most convenient hotel in Nepal.\nAI offers numerous benefits across various industries and applications. Some of the most commonly cited benefits include:\nAI can automate routine, repetitive and often tedious tasks including digital tasks such as data collection, entering and preprocessing, and physical tasks such as warehouse stock-picking and manufacturing processes. This automation frees to work on higher value, more creative work.\nWhether used for decision support or for fully automated decision-making, AI enables faster, more accurate predictions and reliable, data-driven decisions. Combined with automation, AI enables businesses to act on opportunities and respond to crises as they emerge, in real time and without human intervention.\nAI can reduce human errors in various ways, from guiding people through the proper steps of a process, to flagging potential errors before they occur, and fully automating processes without human intervention. This is especially important in industries such as healthcare where, for example, AI-guided surgical robotics enable consistent precision.\nMachine learning algorithms can continually improve their accuracy and further reduce errors as they're exposed to more data and \"learn\" from experience.\nAI is always on, available around the clock, and delivers consistent performance every time. Tools such as AI chatbots or virtual assistants can lighten staffing demands for customer service or support. In other applications such as materials processing or production lines, AI can help maintain consistent work quality and output levels when used to complete repetitive or tedious tasks.\nBy automating dangerous work such as animal control, handling explosives, performing tasks in deep ocean water, high altitudes or in outer space, AI can eliminate the need to put human workers at risk of injury or worse. While they have yet to be perfected, self-driving cars and other vehicles offer the potential to reduce the risk of injury to passengers.\nThe real-world applications of AI are many. Here is just a small sampling of use cases across various industries to illustrate its potential:\nCompanies can implement AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants to handle customer inquiries, support tickets and more. These tools use natural language processing (NLP) and generative AI capabilities to understand and respond to customer questions about order status, product details and return policies.\nChatbots and virtual assistants enable always-on support, provide faster answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs), free human agents to focus on higher-level tasks, and give customers faster, more consistent service.\nMachine learning and deep learning algorithms can analyze transaction patterns and flag anomalies, such as unusual spending or login locations, that indicate fraudulent transactions. This enables organizations to respond more quickly to potential fraud and limit its impact, giving themselves and customers greater peace of mind.\nRetailers, banks and other customer-facing companies can use AI to create personalized customer experiences and marketing campaigns that delight customers, improve sales and prevent churn. Based on data from customer purchase history and behaviors, deep learning algorithms can recommend products and services customers are likely to want, and even generate personalized copy and special offers for individual customers in real time.\nAI-driven recruitment platforms can streamline hiring by screening resumes, matching candidates with job descriptions, and even conducting preliminary interviews using video analysis. These and other tools can dramatically reduce the mountain of administrative paperwork associated with fielding a large volume of candidates. It can also reduce response times and time-to-hire, improving the experience for candidates whether they get the job or not.\nGenerative AI code generation tools and automation tools can streamline repetitive coding tasks associated with application development, and accelerate the migration and modernization (reformatting and replatorming) of legacy applications at scale. These tools can speed up tasks, help ensure code consistency and reduce errors.\nMachine learning models can analyze data from sensors, Internet of Things (IoT) devices and operational technology (OT) to forecast when maintenance will be required and predict equipment failures before they occur. AI-powered preventive maintenance helps prevent downtime and enables you to stay ahead of supply chain issues before they affect the bottom line.\nOrganizations are scrambling to take advantage of the latest AI technologies and capitalize on AI's many benefits. This rapid adoption is necessary, but adopting and maintaining AI workflows comes with challenges and risks.\nAI systems rely on data sets that might be vulnerable to data poisoning, data tampering, data bias or cyberattacks that can lead to data breaches. Organizations can mitigate these risks by protecting data integrity and implementing security and availability throughout the entire AI lifecycle, from development to training and deployment and postdeployment.\nThreat actors can target AI models for theft, reverse engineering or unauthorized manipulation. Attackers might compromise a model’s integrity by tampering with its architecture, weights or parameters; the core components that determine a model’s behavior, accuracy and performance.\nLike all technologies, models are susceptible to operational risks such as model drift, bias and breakdowns in the governance structure. Left unaddressed, these risks can lead to system failures and cybersecurity vulnerabilities that threat actors can use.\nIf organizations don’t prioritize safety and ethics when developing and deploying AI systems, they risk committing privacy violations and producing biased outcomes. For example, biased training data used for hiring decisions might reinforce gender or racial stereotypes and create AI models that favor certain demographic groups over others.\nAI ethics is a multidisciplinary field that studies how to optimize AI's beneficial impact while reducing risks and adverse outcomes. Principles of AI ethics are applied through a system of AI governance consisted of guardrails that help ensure that AI tools and systems remain safe and ethical.\nAI governance encompasses oversight mechanisms that address risks. An ethical approach to AI governance requires the involvement of a wide range of stakeholders, including developers, users, policymakers and ethicists, helping to ensure that AI-related systems are developed and used to align with society's values.\nHere are common values associated with AI ethics and responsible AI:\nAs AI becomes more advanced, humans are challenged to comprehend and retrace how the algorithm came to a result. Explainable AI is a set of processes and methods that enables human users to interpret, comprehend and trust the results and output created by algorithms.\nAlthough machine learning, by its very nature, is a form of statistical discrimination, the discrimination becomes objectionable when it places privileged groups at systematic advantage and certain unprivileged groups at systematic disadvantage, potentially causing varied harms. To encourage fairness, practitioners can try to minimize algorithmic bias across data collection and model design, and to build more diverse and inclusive teams.\nRobust AI effectively handles exceptional conditions, such as abnormalities in input or malicious attacks, without causing unintentional harm. It is also built to withstand intentional and unintentional interference by protecting against exposed vulnerabilities.\nOrganizations should implement clear responsibilities and governance\nstructures for the development, deployment and outcomes of AI systems.\nIn addition, users should be able to see how an AI service works,\nevaluate its functionality, and comprehend its strengths and\nlimitations. Increased transparency provides information for AI\nconsumers to better understand how the AI model or service was created.\nMany regulatory frameworks, including GDPR, mandate that organizations abide by certain privacy principles when processing personal information. It is crucial to be able to protect AI models that might contain personal information, control what data goes into the model in the first place, and to build adaptable systems that can adjust to changes in regulation and attitudes around AI ethics.\nIn order to contextualize the use of AI at various levels of complexity and sophistication, researchers have defined several types of AI that refer to its level of sophistication:\nWeak AI: Also known as “narrow AI,” defines AI systems designed to perform a specific task or a set of tasks. Examples might include “smart” voice assistant apps, such as Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, a social media chatbot or the autonomous vehicles promised by Tesla.\nStrong AI: Also known as “artificial general intelligence” (AGI) or “general AI,” possess the ability to understand, learn and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a level equal to or surpassing human intelligence. This level of AI is currently theoretical and no known AI systems approach this level of sophistication. Researchers argue that if AGI is even possible, it requires major increases in computing power. Despite recent advances in AI development, self-aware AI systems of science fiction remain firmly in that realm.\nThe idea of \"a machine that thinks\" dates back to ancient Greece. But since the advent of electronic computing (and relative to some of the topics discussed in this article) important events and milestones in the evolution of AI include the following:\n1950\nAlan Turing publishes Computing Machinery and Intelligence. In this paper, Turing famous for breaking the German ENIGMA code during WWII and often referred to as the \"father of computer science\" asks the following question: \"Can machines think?\"\nFrom there, he offers a test, now famously known as the \"Turing Test,\" where a human interrogator would try to distinguish between a computer and human text response. While this test has undergone much scrutiny since it was published, it remains an important part of the history of AI, and an ongoing concept within philosophy as it uses ideas around linguistics.\n1956\nJohn McCarthy coins the term \"artificial intelligence\" at the first-ever AI conference at Dartmouth College. (McCarthy went on to invent the Lisp language.) Later that year, Allen Newell, J.C. Shaw and Herbert Simon create the Logic Theorist, the first-ever running AI computer program.\n1967\nFrank Rosenblatt builds the Mark 1 Perceptron, the first computer based on a neural network that \"learned\" through trial and error. Just a year later, Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert publish a book titled Perceptrons, which becomes both the landmark work on neural networks and, at least for a while, an argument against future neural network research initiatives.\n1980\nNeural networks, which use a backpropagation algorithm to train itself, became widely used in AI applications.\n1995\nStuart Russell and Peter Norvig publish Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, which becomes one of the leading textbooks in the study of AI. In it, they delve into four potential goals or definitions of AI, which differentiates computer systems based on rationality and thinking versus acting.\n1997\nIBM's Deep Blue beats then world chess champion Garry Kasparov, in a chess match (and rematch).\n2004\nJohn McCarthy writes a paper, What Is Artificial Intelligence?, and proposes an often-cited definition of AI. By this time, the era of big data and cloud computing is underway, enabling organizations to manage ever-larger data estates, which will one day be used to train AI models.\n2011\nIBM Watson® beats champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter at Jeopardy! Also, around this time, data science begins to emerge as a popular discipline.\n2015\nBaidu's Minwa supercomputer uses a special deep neural network called a convolutional neural network to identify and categorize images with a higher rate of accuracy than the average human.\n2016\nDeepMind's AlphaGo program, powered by a deep neural network, beats Lee Sodol, the world champion Go player, in a five-game match. The victory is significant given the huge number of possible moves as the game progresses (over 14.5 trillion after just four moves). Later, Google purchased DeepMind for a reported USD 400 million.\n2022\nA rise in large language models or LLMs, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, creates an enormous change in performance of AI and its potential to drive enterprise value. With these new generative AI practices, deep-learning models can be pretrained on large amounts of data.\n2024\nThe latest AI trends point to a continuing AI renaissance. Multimodal models that can take multiple types of data as input are providing richer, more robust experiences. These models bring together computer vision image recognition and NLP speech recognition capabilities. Smaller models are also making strides in an age of diminishing returns with massive models with large parameter counts.",

For nearly 25 years, Wikipedia editors have researched, deliberated, discussed, built consensus, and collaboratively written the largest encyclopedia humankind has ever seen. Their care and commitment to reliable encyclopedic knowledge is something AI cannot replace.\nThat is why our new AI strategy doubles down on the volunteers behind Wikipedia.\nWe will use AI to build features that remove technical barriers to allow the humans at the core of Wikipedia to spend their valuable time on what they want to accomplish, and not on how to technically achieve it. Our investments will be focused on specific areas where generative AI excels, all in the service of creating unique opportunities that will boost Wikipedia’s volunteers:\n- Supporting Wikipedia’s moderators and patrollers with AI-assisted workflows that automate tedious tasks in support of knowledge integrity;\n- Giving Wikipedia’s editors time back by improving the discoverability of information on Wikipedia to leave more time for human deliberation, judgment, and consensus building;\n- Helping editors share local perspectives or context by automating the translation and adaptation of common topics;\n- Scaling the onboarding of new Wikipedia volunteers with guided mentorship.\nWe believe that our future work with AI will be successful not only because of what we do, but how we do it. Our efforts will use our long-held values, principles, and policies (like privacy and human rights) as a compass: we will take a human-centered approach and will prioritize human agency; we will prioritize using open-source or open-weight AI; we will prioritize transparency; and we will take a nuanced approach to multilinguality, a fundamental part of Wikipedia.\nProviding freely accessible knowledge to anyone on the planet is Wikipedia’s mission, one that has only grown in importance since the rise of generative AI. Its success is why Wikipedia is at the core of every AI training model.

On Wednesday, the Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit that runs Wikipedia, announced that it was integrating generative AI into its editing process as a means to help its volunteer and largely unpaid staff of moderators, editors, and patrollers reduce their workload and focus more on quality control.\nIn a statement, Chris Albon, Director of Machine Learning, and Leila Zia, Director and Head of Research, emphasized that they did not want AI to replace their human editors or end up generating Wikipedia’s content. “We will take a human-centered approach and will prioritize human agency; we will prioritize using open-source or open-weight AI; we will prioritize transparency; and we will take a nuanced approach to multilinguality.”\nRather, their blog post says AI would be used to “remove technical barriers” and “tedious tasks” that impede editors’ workflow, such as background research, translation, and onboarding new volunteers, to spend more time on deliberation and less on technical support.\nThe site already uses AI to detect vandalism, translate content, and predict readability, but until this announcement, it had not offered AI services to its editors. In recent years, the Wikimedia Foundation has attempted to make life easier for its volunteer workers, from adding new features to improve the editing experience to offering them legal protection from right-wing harassment campaigns.\nBut the amount of information and content in the world is rapidly outpacing the number of active volunteers able to moderate it, and Wikipedia faces a future where AI would, quite literally, eat it alive. Earlier this month, the Wikimedia Foundation announced a new initiative to create an open access dataset of “structured Wikipedia content,” that is, a copy of Wikipedia content optimized specifically for machine learning, with the aim of keeping the bots off the site meant for human browsing. In recent years, the number of AI bots scraping the site has drastically scaled to the point that bot traffic has actually put a strain on their servers and increased bandwidth consumption by 50 percent.\nCorrection, May 5th: A previous version of this post listed only one author of the Wikimedia Foundation post; it was credited to both Chris Albon and Leila Zia.\nMost Popular\n- Microsoft adds over 50 ‘Retro Classics’ to Game Pass\n- Microsoft blocks emails that contain ‘Palestine’ after employee protests\n- Details leak about Jony Ive’s new ‘screen-free’ OpenAI device\n- OpenAI is buying Jony Ive’s AI hardware company\n- Fujifilm’s X Half camera is so dedicated to the analog vibes, it can’t shoot RAW",

          "content": "Machine learning\nMachine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalise to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions.[1] Within a subdiscipline in machine learning, advances in the field of deep learning have allowed neural networks, a class of statistical algorithms, to surpass many previous machine learning approaches in performance.[2]\nML finds application in many fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, email filtering, agriculture, and medicine.[3][4] The application of ML to business problems is known as predictive analytics.\nStatistics and mathematical optimisation (mathematical programming) methods comprise the foundations of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) via unsupervised learning.[6][7]\nFrom a theoretical viewpoint, probably approximately correct learning provides a framework for describing machine learning.\nHistory\n[edit]The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, an IBM employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence.[8][9] The synonym self-teaching computers was also used in this time period.[10][11]\nAlthough the earliest machine learning model was introduced in the 1950s when Arthur Samuel invented a program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side, the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes.[12] In 1949, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb published the book The Organization of Behavior, in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells.[13] Hebb's model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes, or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data.[12] Other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well, including logician Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch, who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes.[12]\nBy the early 1960s, an experimental \"learning machine\" with punched tape memory, called Cybertron, had been developed by Raytheon Company to analyse sonar signals, electrocardiograms, and speech patterns using rudimentary reinforcement learning. It was repetitively \"trained\" by a human operator/teacher to recognise patterns and equipped with a \"goof\" button to cause it to reevaluate incorrect decisions.[14] A representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was Nilsson's book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification.[15] Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973.[16] In 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that an artificial neural network learns to recognise 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal.[17]\nTom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.\"[18] This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing's proposal in his paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\", in which the question \"Can machines think?\" is replaced with the question \"Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?\".[19]\nModern-day machine learning has two objectives. One is to classify data based on models which have been developed; the other purpose is to make predictions for future outcomes based on these models. A hypothetical algorithm specific to classifying data may use computer vision of moles coupled with supervised learning in order to train it to classify the cancerous moles. A machine learning algorithm for stock trading may inform the trader of future potential predictions.[20]\nRelationships to other fields\n[edit]Artificial intelligence\n[edit]As a scientific endeavour, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence (AI). In the early days of AI as an academic discipline, some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what were then termed \"neural networks\"; these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalised linear models of statistics.[22] Probabilistic reasoning was also employed, especially in automated medical diagnosis.[23]: 488\nHowever, an increasing emphasis on the logical, knowledge-based approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning. Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation.[23]: 488 By 1980, expert systems had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favour.[24] Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to inductive logic programming(ILP), but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in pattern recognition and information retrieval.[23]: 708–710, 755 Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time. This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as \"connectionism\", by researchers from other disciplines including John Hopfield, David Rumelhart, and Geoffrey Hinton. Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation.[23]: 25\nMachine learning (ML), reorganised and recognised as its own field, started to flourish in the 1990s. The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature. It shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics, fuzzy logic, and probability theory.[24]\nData compression\n[edit]There is a close connection between machine learning and compression. A system that predicts the posterior probabilities of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression (by using arithmetic coding on the output distribution). Conversely, an optimal compressor can be used for prediction (by finding the symbol that compresses best, given the previous history). This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for \"general intelligence\".[25][26][27]\nAn alternative view can show compression algorithms implicitly map strings into implicit feature space vectors, and compression-based similarity measures compute similarity within these feature spaces. For each compressor C(.) we define an associated vector space ℵ, such that C(.) maps an input string x, corresponding to the vector norm ||~x||. An exhaustive examination of the feature spaces underlying all compression algorithms is precluded by space; instead, feature vectors chooses to examine three representative lossless compression methods, LZW, LZ77, and PPM.[28]\nAccording to AIXI theory, a connection more directly explained in Hutter Prize, the best possible compression of x is the smallest possible software that generates x. For example, in that model, a zip file's compressed size includes both the zip file and the unzipping software, since you can not unzip it without both, but there may be an even smaller combined form.\nExamples of AI-powered audio/video compression software include NVIDIA Maxine, AIVC.[29] Examples of software that can perform AI-powered image compression include OpenCV, TensorFlow, MATLAB's Image Processing Toolbox (IPT) and High-Fidelity Generative Image Compression.[30]\nIn unsupervised machine learning, k-means clustering can be utilized to compress data by grouping similar data points into clusters. This technique simplifies handling extensive datasets that lack predefined labels and finds widespread use in fields such as image compression.[31]\nData compression aims to reduce the size of data files, enhancing storage efficiency and speeding up data transmission. K-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, is employed to partition a dataset into a specified number of clusters, k, each represented by the centroid of its points. This process condenses extensive datasets into a more compact set of representative points. Particularly beneficial in image and signal processing, k-means clustering aids in data reduction by replacing groups of data points with their centroids, thereby preserving the core information of the original data while significantly decreasing the required storage space.[32]\nLarge language models (LLMs) are also efficient lossless data compressors on some data sets, as demonstrated by DeepMind's research with the Chinchilla 70B model. Developed by DeepMind, Chinchilla 70B effectively compressed data, outperforming conventional methods such as Portable Network Graphics (PNG) for images and Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) for audio. It achieved compression of image and audio data to 43.4% and 16.4% of their original sizes, respectively. There is, however, some reason to be concerned that the data set used for testing overlaps the LLM training data set, making it possible that the Chinchilla 70B model is only an efficient compression tool on data it has already been trained on.[33][34]Data mining\n[edit]Machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on the discovery of (previously) unknown properties in the data (this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases). Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as \"unsupervised learning\" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, ECML PKDD being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data.\nMachine learning also has intimate ties to optimisation: Many learning problems are formulated as minimisation of some loss function on a training set of examples. Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the preassigned labels of a set of examples).[35]\nGeneralization\n[edit]Characterizing the generalisation of various learning algorithms is an active topic of current research, especially for deep learning algorithms.\nStatistics\n[edit]Machine learning and statistics are closely related fields in terms of methods, but distinct in their principal goal: statistics draws population inferences from a sample, while machine learning finds generalisable predictive patterns.[36] According to Michael I. Jordan, the ideas of machine learning, from methodological principles to theoretical tools, have had a long pre-history in statistics.[37] He also suggested the term data science as a placeholder to call the overall field.[37]\nConventional statistical analyses require the a priori selection of a model most suitable for the study data set. In addition, only significant or theoretically relevant variables based on previous experience are included for analysis. In contrast, machine learning is not built on a pre-structured model; rather, the data shape the model by detecting underlying patterns. The more variables (input) used to train the model, the more accurate the ultimate model will be.[38]\nLeo Breiman distinguished two statistical modelling paradigms: data model and algorithmic model,[39] wherein \"algorithmic model\" means more or less the machine learning algorithms like Random Forest.\nSome statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning.[40]\nStatistical physics\n[edit]Analytical and computational techniques derived from deep-rooted physics of disordered systems can be extended to large-scale problems, including machine learning, e.g., to analyse the weight space of deep neural networks.[41] Statistical physics is thus finding applications in the area of medical diagnostics.[42]\nTheory\n[edit]A core objective of a learner is to generalise from its experience.[5][43] Generalisation in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set. The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases.\nThe computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory via the probably approximately correct learning model. Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. The bias–variance decomposition is one way to quantify generalisation error.\nFor the best performance in the context of generalisation, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has under fitted the data. If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to overfitting and generalisation will be poorer.[44]\nIn addition to performance bounds, learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time. There are two kinds of time complexity results: Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time. Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time.\nApproaches\n[edit]\nMachine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, which correspond to learning paradigms, depending on the nature of the \"signal\" or \"feedback\" available to the learning system:\n- Supervised learning: The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a \"teacher\", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs.\n- Unsupervised learning: No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end (feature learning).\n- Reinforcement learning: A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent). As it navigates its problem space, the program is provided feedback that's analogous to rewards, which it tries to maximise.[5]\nAlthough each algorithm has advantages and limitations, no single algorithm works for all problems.[45][46][47]\nSupervised learning\n[edit]Supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs.[48] The data, known as training data, consists of a set of training examples. Each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output, also known as a supervisory signal. In the mathematical model, each training example is represented by an array or vector, sometimes called a feature vector, and the training data is represented by a matrix. Through iterative optimisation of an objective function, supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs.[49] An optimal function allows the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data. An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task.[18]\nTypes of supervised-learning algorithms include active learning, classification and regression.[50] Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values, while regression algorithms are used when the outputs can take any numerical value within a range. For example, in a classification algorithm that filters emails, the input is an incoming email, and the output is the folder in which to file the email. In contrast, regression is used for tasks such as predicting a person's height based on factors like age and genetics or forecasting future temperatures based on historical data.[51]\nSimilarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification, but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are. It has applications in ranking, recommendation systems, visual identity tracking, face verification, and speaker verification.\nUnsupervised learning\n[edit]Unsupervised learning algorithms find structures in data that has not been labelled, classified or categorised. Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data. Central applications of unsupervised machine learning include clustering, dimensionality reduction,[7] and density estimation.[52]\nCluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters) so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar. Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated, for example, by internal compactness, or the similarity between members of the same cluster, and separation, the difference between clusters. Other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity.\nA special type of unsupervised learning called, self-supervised learning involves training a model by generating the supervisory signal from the data itself.[53][54]\nSemi-supervised learning\n[edit]Semi-supervised learning falls between unsupervised learning (without any labelled training data) and supervised learning (with completely labelled training data). Some of the training examples are missing training labels, yet many machine-learning researchers have found that unlabelled data, when used in conjunction with a small amount of labelled data, can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy.\nIn weakly supervised learning, the training labels are noisy, limited, or imprecise; however, these labels are often cheaper to obtain, resulting in larger effective training sets.[55]\nReinforcement learning\n[edit]Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximise some notion of cumulative reward. Due to its generality, the field is studied in many other disciplines, such as game theory, control theory, operations research, information theory, simulation-based optimisation, multi-agent systems, swarm intelligence, statistics and genetic algorithms. In reinforcement learning, the environment is typically represented as a Markov decision process (MDP). Many reinforcement learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques.[56] Reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP and are used when exact models are infeasible. Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent.\nDimensionality reduction\n[edit]Dimensionality reduction is a process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables.[57] In other words, it is a process of reducing the dimension of the feature set, also called the \"number of features\". Most of the dimensionality reduction techniques can be considered as either feature elimination or extraction. One of the popular methods of dimensionality reduction is principal component analysis (PCA). PCA involves changing higher-dimensional data (e.g., 3D) to a smaller space (e.g., 2D). The manifold hypothesis proposes that high-dimensional data sets lie along low-dimensional manifolds, and many dimensionality reduction techniques make this assumption, leading to the area of manifold learning and manifold regularisation.\nOther types\n[edit]Other approaches have been developed which do not fit neatly into this three-fold categorisation, and sometimes more than one is used by the same machine learning system. For example, topic modelling, meta-learning.[58]\nSelf-learning\n[edit]Self-learning, as a machine learning paradigm was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of self-learning, named crossbar adaptive array (CAA).[59][60] It gives a solution to the problem learning without any external reward, by introducing emotion as an internal reward. Emotion is used as state evaluation of a self-learning agent. The CAA self-learning algorithm computes, in a crossbar fashion, both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about consequence situations. The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion.[61] The self-learning algorithm updates a memory matrix W =||w(a,s)|| such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine:\n- in situation s perform action a\n- receive a consequence situation s'\n- compute emotion of being in the consequence situation v(s')\n- update crossbar memory w'(a,s) = w(a,s) + v(s')\nIt is a system with only one input, situation, and only one output, action (or behaviour) a. There is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment. The backpropagated value (secondary reinforcement) is the emotion toward the consequence situation. The CAA exists in two environments, one is the behavioural environment where it behaves, and the other is the genetic environment, wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioural environment. After receiving the genome (species) vector from the genetic environment, the CAA learns a goal-seeking behaviour, in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations.[62]\nFeature learning\n[edit]Several learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training.[63] Classic examples include principal component analysis and cluster analysis. Feature learning algorithms, also called representation learning algorithms, often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful, often as a pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions. This technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data-generating distribution, while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution. This replaces manual feature engineering, and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task.\nFeature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised. In supervised feature learning, features are learned using labelled input data. Examples include artificial neural networks, multilayer perceptrons, and supervised dictionary learning. In unsupervised feature learning, features are learned with unlabelled input data. Examples include dictionary learning, independent component analysis, autoencoders, matrix factorisation[64] and various forms of clustering.[65][66][67]\nManifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low-dimensional. Sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse, meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros. Multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn low-dimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data, without reshaping them into higher-dimensional vectors.[68] Deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation, or a hierarchy of features, with higher-level, more abstract features defined in terms of (or generating) lower-level features. It has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data.[69]\nFeature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process. However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensory data has not yielded attempts to algorithmically define specific features. An alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination, without relying on explicit algorithms.\nSparse dictionary learning\n[edit]Sparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of basis functions and assumed to be a sparse matrix. The method is strongly NP-hard and difficult to solve approximately.[70] A popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is the k-SVD algorithm. Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts. In classification, the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs. For a dictionary where each class has already been built, a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary. Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image de-noising. The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot.[71]\nAnomaly detection\n[edit]In data mining, anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data.[72] Typically, the anomalous items represent an issue such as bank fraud, a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text. Anomalies are referred to as outliers, novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions.[73]\nIn particular, in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection, the interesting objects are often not rare objects, but unexpected bursts of inactivity. This pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object. Many outlier detection methods (in particular, unsupervised algorithms) will fail on such data unless aggregated appropriately. Instead, a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro-clusters formed by these patterns.[74]\nThree broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist.[75] Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabelled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal, by looking for instances that seem to fit the least to the remainder of the data set. Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labelled as \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" and involves training a classifier (the key difference from many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection). Semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behaviour from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model.\nRobot learning\n[edit]Robot learning is inspired by a multitude of machine learning methods, starting from supervised learning, reinforcement learning,[76][77] and finally meta-learning (e.g. MAML).\nAssociation rules\n[edit]Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of \"interestingness\".[78]\nRule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves \"rules\" to store, manipulate or apply knowledge. The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilisation of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction.[79] Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems, association rule learning, and artificial immune systems.\nBased on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal, Tomasz Imieliński and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets.[80] For example, the rule found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional pricing or product placements. In addition to market basket analysis, association rules are employed today in application areas including Web usage mining, intrusion detection, continuous production, and bioinformatics. In contrast with sequence mining, association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions.\nLearning classifier systems (LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component, typically a genetic algorithm, with a learning component, performing either supervised learning, reinforcement learning, or unsupervised learning. They seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions.[81]\nInductive logic programming (ILP) is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses. Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples. Inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming language for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as functional programs.\nInductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing. Gordon Plotkin and Ehud Shapiro laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting.[82][83][84] Shapiro built their first implementation (Model Inference System) in 1981: a Prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples.[85] The term inductive here refers to philosophical induction, suggesting a theory to explain observed facts, rather than mathematical induction, proving a property for all members of a well-ordered set.\nModels\n[edit]A machine learning model is a type of mathematical model that, once \"trained\" on a given dataset, can be used to make predictions or classifications on new data. During training, a learning algorithm iteratively adjusts the model's internal parameters to minimise errors in its predictions.[86] By extension, the term \"model\" can refer to several levels of specificity, from a general class of models and their associated learning algorithms to a fully trained model with all its internal parameters tuned.[87]\nVarious types of models have been used and researched for machine learning systems, picking the best model for a task is called model selection.\nArtificial neural networks\n[edit]Artificial neural networks (ANNs), or connectionist systems, are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems \"learn\" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules.\nAn ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called \"artificial neurons\", which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit information, a \"signal\", from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it. In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections between artificial neurons are called \"edges\". Artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.\nThe original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology. Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis.\nDeep learning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition.[88]\nDecision trees\n[edit]Decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item's target value (represented in the leaves). It is one of the predictive modelling approaches used in statistics, data mining, and machine learning. Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, leaves represent class labels, and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees. In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making. In data mining, a decision tree describes data, but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision-making.\nRandom forest regression\n[edit]Random forest regression (RFR) falls under umbrella of decision tree-based models. RFR is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions to improve accuracy and to avoid overfitting. To build decision trees, RFR uses bootstrapped sampling, for instance each decision tree is trained on random data of from training set. This random selection of RFR for training enables model to reduce bias predictions and achieve accuracy. RFR generates independent decision trees, and it can work on single output data as well multiple regressor task. This makes RFR compatible to be used in various application.[89][90]\nSupport-vector machines\n[edit]Support-vector machines (SVMs), also known as support-vector networks, are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category.[91] An SVM training algorithm is a non-probabilistic, binary, linear classifier, although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting. In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.\nRegression analysis\n[edit]Regression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features. Its most common form is linear regression, where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as ordinary least squares. The latter is often extended by regularisation methods to mitigate overfitting and bias, as in ridge regression. When dealing with non-linear problems, go-to models include polynomial regression (for example, used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel[92]), logistic regression (often used in statistical classification) or even kernel regression, which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of the kernel trick to implicitly map input variables to higher-dimensional space.\nMultivariate linear regression extends the concept of linear regression to handle multiple dependent variables simultaneously. This approach estimates the relationships between a set of input variables and several output variables by fitting a multidimensional linear model. It is particularly useful in scenarios where outputs are interdependent or share underlying patterns, such as predicting multiple economic indicators or reconstructing images,[93] which are inherently multi-dimensional.\nBayesian networks\n[edit]A Bayesian network, belief network, or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph (DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning. Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables, like speech signals or protein sequences, are called dynamic Bayesian networks. Generalisations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams.\nGaussian processes\n[edit]A Gaussian process is a stochastic process in which every finite collection of the random variables in the process has a multivariate normal distribution, and it relies on a pre-defined covariance function, or kernel, that models how pairs of points relate to each other depending on their locations.\nGiven a set of observed points, or input–output examples, the distribution of the (unobserved) output of a new point as function of its input data can be directly computed by looking like the observed points and the covariances between those points and the new, unobserved point.\nGaussian processes are popular surrogate models in Bayesian optimisation used to do hyperparameter optimisation.\nGenetic algorithms\n[edit]A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimics the process of natural selection, using methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotypes in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem. In machine learning, genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s.[95][96] Conversely, machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms.[97]\nBelief functions\n[edit]The theory of belief functions, also referred to as evidence theory or Dempster–Shafer theory, is a general framework for reasoning with uncertainty, with understood connections to other frameworks such as probability, possibility and imprecise probability theories. These theoretical frameworks can be thought of as a kind of learner and have some analogous properties of how evidence is combined (e.g., Dempster's rule of combination), just like how in a pmf-based Bayesian approach would combine probabilities.[98] However, there are many caveats to these beliefs functions when compared to Bayesian approaches in order to incorporate ignorance and uncertainty quantification. These belief function approaches that are implemented within the machine learning domain typically leverage a fusion approach of various ensemble methods to better handle the learner's decision boundary, low samples, and ambiguous class issues that standard machine learning approach tend to have difficulty resolving.[4][9] However, the computational complexity of these algorithms are dependent on the number of propositions (classes), and can lead to a much higher computation time when compared to other machine learning approaches.\nRule-based models\n[edit]Rule-based machine learning (RBML) is a branch of machine learning that automatically discovers and learns 'rules' from data. It provides interpretable models, making it useful for decision-making in fields like healthcare, fraud detection, and cybersecurity. Key RBML techniques includes learning classifier systems,[99] association rule learning,[100] artificial immune systems,[101] and other similar models. These methods extract patterns from data and evolve rules over time.\nTraining models\n[edit]Typically, machine learning models require a high quantity of reliable data to perform accurate predictions. When training a machine learning model, machine learning engineers need to target and collect a large and representative sample of data. Data from the training set can be as varied as a corpus of text, a collection of images, sensor data, and data collected from individual users of a service. Overfitting is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model. Trained models derived from biased or non-evaluated data can result in skewed or undesired predictions. Biased models may result in detrimental outcomes, thereby furthering the negative impacts on society or objectives. Algorithmic bias is a potential result of data not being fully prepared for training. Machine learning ethics is becoming a field of study and notably, becoming integrated within machine learning engineering teams.\nFederated learning\n[edit]Federated learning is an adapted form of distributed artificial intelligence to training machine learning models that decentralises the training process, allowing for users' privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralised server. This also increases efficiency by decentralising the training process to many devices. For example, Gboard uses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users' mobile phones without having to send individual searches back to Google.[102]\nApplications\n[edit]There are many applications for machine learning, including:\n- Agriculture\n- Anatomy\n- Adaptive website\n- Affective computing\n- Astronomy\n- Automated decision-making\n- Banking\n- Behaviorism\n- Bioinformatics\n- Brain–machine interfaces\n- Cheminformatics\n- Citizen Science\n- Climate Science\n- Computer networks\n- Computer vision\n- Credit-card fraud detection\n- Data quality\n- DNA sequence classification\n- Economics\n- Financial market analysis[103]\n- General game playing\n- Handwriting recognition\n- Healthcare\n- Information retrieval\n- Insurance\n- Internet fraud detection\n- Knowledge graph embedding\n- Linguistics\n- Machine learning control\n- Machine perception\n- Machine translation\n- Material Engineering\n- Marketing\n- Medical diagnosis\n- Natural language processing\n- Natural language understanding\n- Online advertising\n- Optimisation\n- Recommender systems\n- Robot locomotion\n- Search engines\n- Sentiment analysis\n- Sequence mining\n- Software engineering\n- Speech recognition\n- Structural health monitoring\n- Syntactic pattern recognition\n- Telecommunications\n- Theorem proving\n- Time-series forecasting\n- Tomographic reconstruction[104]\n- User behaviour analytics\nIn 2006, the media-services provider Netflix held the first \"Netflix Prize\" competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy of its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10%. A joint team made up of researchers from AT&T Labs-Research in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built an ensemble model to win the Grand Prize in 2009 for $1 million.[105] Shortly after the prize was awarded, Netflix realised that viewers' ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns (\"everything is a recommendation\") and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly.[106] In 2010 The Wall Street Journal wrote about the firm Rebellion Research and their use of machine learning to predict the financial crisis.[107] In 2012, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, Vinod Khosla, predicted that 80% of medical doctors jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software.[108] In 2014, it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings and that it may have revealed previously unrecognised influences among artists.[109] In 2019 Springer Nature published the first research book created using machine learning.[110] In 2020, machine learning technology was used to help make diagnoses and aid researchers in developing a cure for COVID-19.[111] Machine learning was recently applied to predict the pro-environmental behaviour of travellers.[112] Recently, machine learning technology was also applied to optimise smartphone's performance and thermal behaviour based on the user's interaction with the phone.[113][114][115] When applied correctly, machine learning algorithms (MLAs) can utilise a wide range of company characteristics to predict stock returns without overfitting. By employing effective feature engineering and combining forecasts, MLAs can generate results that far surpass those obtained from basic linear techniques like OLS.[116]\nRecent advancements in machine learning have extended into the field of quantum chemistry, where novel algorithms now enable the prediction of solvent effects on chemical reactions, thereby offering new tools for chemists to tailor experimental conditions for optimal outcomes.[117]\nMachine Learning is becoming a useful tool to investigate and predict evacuation decision making in large scale and small scale disasters. Different solutions have been tested to predict if and when householders decide to evacuate during wildfires and hurricanes.[118][119][120] Other applications have been focusing on pre evacuation decisions in building fires.[121][122]\nMachine learning is also emerging as a promising tool in geotechnical engineering, where it is used to support tasks such as ground classification, hazard prediction, and site characterization. Recent research emphasizes a move toward data-centric methods in this field, where machine learning is not a replacement for engineering judgment, but a way to enhance it using site-specific data and patterns.[123]\nLimitations\n[edit]Although machine learning has been transformative in some fields, machine-learning programs often fail to deliver expected results.[124][125][126] Reasons for this are numerous: lack of (suitable) data, lack of access to the data, data bias, privacy problems, badly chosen tasks and algorithms, wrong tools and people, lack of resources, and evaluation problems.[127]\nThe \"black box theory\" poses another yet significant challenge. Black box refers to a situation where the algorithm or the process of producing an output is entirely opaque, meaning that even the coders of the algorithm cannot audit the pattern that the machine extracted out of the data.[128] The House of Lords Select Committee, which claimed that such an \"intelligence system\" that could have a \"substantial impact on an individual's life\" would not be considered acceptable unless it provided \"a full and satisfactory explanation for the decisions\" it makes.[128]\nIn 2018, a self-driving car from Uber failed to detect a pedestrian, who was killed after a collision.[129] Attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the IBM Watson system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested.[130][131] Microsoft's Bing Chat chatbot has been reported to produce hostile and offensive response against its users.[132]\nMachine learning has been used as a strategy to update the evidence related to a systematic review and increased reviewer burden related to the growth of biomedical literature. While it has improved with training sets, it has not yet developed sufficiently to reduce the workload burden without limiting the necessary sensitivity for the findings research themselves.[133]\nExplainability\n[edit]Explainable AI (XAI), or Interpretable AI, or Explainable Machine Learning (XML), is artificial intelligence (AI) in which humans can understand the decisions or predictions made by the AI.[134] It contrasts with the \"black box\" concept in machine learning where even its designers cannot explain why an AI arrived at a specific decision.[135] By refining the mental models of users of AI-powered systems and dismantling their misconceptions, XAI promises to help users perform more effectively. XAI may be an implementation of the social right to explanation.\nOverfitting\n[edit]Settling on a bad, overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as overfitting. Many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data but penalising the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is.[136]\nOther limitations and vulnerabilities\n[edit]Learners can also disappoint by \"learning the wrong lesson\". A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses.[137] A real-world example is that, unlike humans, current image classifiers often do not primarily make judgements from the spatial relationship between components of the picture, and they learn relationships between pixels that humans are oblivious to, but that still correlate with images of certain types of real objects. Modifying these patterns on a legitimate image can result in \"adversarial\" images that the system misclassifies.[138][139]\nAdversarial vulnerabilities can also result in nonlinear systems, or from non-pattern perturbations. For some systems, it is possible to change the output by only changing a single adversarially chosen pixel.[140] Machine learning models are often vulnerable to manipulation or evasion via adversarial machine learning.[141]\nResearchers have demonstrated how backdoors can be placed undetectably into classifying (e.g., for categories \"spam\" and well-visible \"not spam\" of posts) machine learning models that are often developed or trained by third parties. Parties can change the classification of any input, including in cases for which a type of data/software transparency is provided, possibly including white-box access.[142][143][144]\nModel assessments\n[edit]Classification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the holdout method, which splits the data in a training and test set (conventionally 2/3 training set and 1/3 test set designation) and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set. In comparison, the K-fold-cross-validation method randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K-1 subsets for training the model. In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, bootstrap, which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy.[145]\nIn addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning true positive rate (TPR) and true negative rate (TNR) respectively. Similarly, investigators sometimes report the false positive rate (FPR) as well as the false negative rate (FNR). However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) along with the accompanying Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) offer additional tools for classification model assessment. Higher AUC is associated with a better performing model.[146]\nEthics\n[edit]\nThe ethics of artificial intelligence covers a broad range of topics within AI that are considered to have particular ethical stakes.[147] This includes algorithmic biases, fairness,[148] automated decision-making,[149] accountability, privacy, and regulation. It also covers various emerging or potential future challenges such as machine ethics (how to make machines that behave ethically), lethal autonomous weapon systems, arms race dynamics, AI safety and alignment, technological unemployment, AI-enabled misinformation, how to treat certain AI systems if they have a moral status (AI welfare and rights), artificial superintelligence and existential risks.[147]\nSome application areas may also have particularly important ethical implications, like healthcare, education, criminal justice, or the military.Bias\n[edit]Different machine learning approaches can suffer from different data biases. A machine learning system trained specifically on current customers may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data. When trained on human-made data, machine learning is likely to pick up the constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society.[150]\nSystems that are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use (algorithmic bias), thus digitising cultural prejudices.[151] For example, in 1988, the UK's Commission for Racial Equality found that St. George's Medical School had been using a computer program trained from data of previous admissions staff and that this program had denied nearly 60 candidates who were found to either be women or have non-European sounding names.[150] Using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants by similarity to previous successful applicants.[152][153] Another example includes predictive policing company Geolitica's predictive algorithm that resulted in \"disproportionately high levels of over-policing in low-income and minority communities\" after being trained with historical crime data.[154]\nWhile responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system is considered a critical part of machine learning, some researchers blame lack of participation and representation of minority population in the field of AI for machine learning's vulnerability to biases.[155] In fact, according to research carried out by the Computing Research Association (CRA) in 2021, \"female faculty merely make up 16.1%\" of all faculty members who focus on AI among several universities around the world.[156] Furthermore, among the group of \"new U.S. resident AI PhD graduates,\" 45% identified as white, 22.4% as Asian, 3.2% as Hispanic, and 2.4% as African American, which further demonstrates a lack of diversity in the field of AI.[156]\nLanguage models learned from data have been shown to contain human-like biases.[157][158] Because human languages contain biases, machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn these biases.[159][160] In 2016, Microsoft tested Tay, a chatbot that learned from Twitter, and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language.[161]\nIn an experiment carried out by ProPublica, an investigative journalism organisation, a machine learning algorithm's insight into the recidivism rates among prisoners falsely flagged \"black defendants high risk twice as often as white defendants\".[154] In 2015, Google Photos once tagged a couple of black people as gorillas, which caused controversy. The gorilla label was subsequently removed, and in 2023, it still cannot recognise gorillas.[162] Similar issues with recognising non-white people have been found in many other systems.[163]\nBecause of such challenges, the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains.[164] Concern for fairness in machine learning, that is, reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good, is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists, including Fei-Fei Li, who said that \"[t]here's nothing artificial about AI. It's inspired by people, it's created by people, and—most importantly—it impacts people. It is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand, and that is a profound responsibility.\"[165]\nFinancial incentives\n[edit]There are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public's interest but as income-generating machines. This is especially true in the United States where there is a long-standing ethical dilemma of improving health care, but also increasing profits. For example, the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm's proprietary owners hold stakes. There is potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals an additional tool to diagnose, medicate, and plan recovery paths for patients, but this requires these biases to be mitigated.[166]\nHardware\n[edit]Since the 2010s, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks (a particular narrow subdomain of machine learning) that contain many layers of nonlinear hidden units.[167] By 2019, graphics processing units (GPUs), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method of training large-scale commercial cloud AI.[168] OpenAI estimated the hardware compute used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet (2012) to AlphaZero (2017), and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of compute required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months.[169][170]\nTensor Processing Units (TPUs)\n[edit]Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are specialised hardware accelerators developed by Google specifically for machine learning workloads. Unlike general-purpose GPUs and FPGAs, TPUs are optimised for tensor computations, making them particularly efficient for deep learning tasks such as training and inference. They are widely used in Google Cloud AI services and large-scale machine learning models like Google's DeepMind AlphaFold and large language models. TPUs leverage matrix multiplication units and high-bandwidth memory to accelerate computations while maintaining energy efficiency.[171] Since their introduction in 2016, TPUs have become a key component of AI infrastructure, especially in cloud-based environments.\nNeuromorphic computing\n[edit]Neuromorphic computing refers to a class of computing systems designed to emulate the structure and functionality of biological neural networks. These systems may be implemented through software-based simulations on conventional hardware or through specialised hardware architectures.[172]\nphysical neural networks\n[edit]A physical neural network is a specific type of neuromorphic hardware that relies on electrically adjustable materials, such as memristors, to emulate the function of neural synapses. The term \"physical neural network\" highlights the use of physical hardware for computation, as opposed to software-based implementations. It broadly refers to artificial neural networks that use materials with adjustable resistance to replicate neural synapses.[173][174]\nEmbedded machine learning\n[edit]Embedded machine learning is a sub-field of machine learning where models are deployed on embedded systems with limited computing resources, such as wearable computers, edge devices and microcontrollers.[175][176][177][178] Running models directly on these devices eliminates the need to transfer and store data on cloud servers for further processing, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches, privacy leaks and theft of intellectual property, personal data and business secrets. Embedded machine learning can be achieved through various techniques, such as hardware acceleration,[179][180] approximate computing,[181] and model optimisation.[182][183] Common optimisation techniques include pruning, quantisation, knowledge distillation, low-rank factorisation, network architecture search, and parameter sharing.\nSoftware\n[edit]Software suites containing a variety of machine learning algorithms include the following:\nFree and open-source software\n[edit]Proprietary software with free and open-source editions\n[edit]Proprietary software\n[edit]- Amazon Machine Learning\n- Angoss KnowledgeSTUDIO\n- Azure Machine Learning\n- IBM Watson Studio\n- Google Cloud Vertex AI\n- Google Prediction API\n- IBM SPSS Modeller\n- KXEN Modeller\n- LIONsolver\n- Mathematica\n- MATLAB\n- Neural Designer\n- NeuroSolutions\n- Oracle Data Mining\n- Oracle AI Platform Cloud Service\n- PolyAnalyst\n- RCASE\n- SAS Enterprise Miner\n- SequenceL\n- Splunk\n- STATISTICA Data Miner\nJournals\n[edit]- Journal of Machine Learning Research\n- Machine Learning\n- Nature Machine Intelligence\n- Neural Computation\n- IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence\nConferences\n[edit]- AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence\n- Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)\n- European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML PKDD)\n- International Conference on Computational Intelligence Methods for Bioinformatics and Biostatistics (CIBB)\n- International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)\n- International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR)\n- International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)\n- Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD)\n- Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)\nSee also\n[edit]- Automated machine learning – Process of automating the application of machine learning\n- Big data – Extremely large or complex datasets\n- Deep learning — branch of ML concerned with artificial neural networks\n- Differentiable programming – Programming paradigm\n- List of datasets for machine-learning research\n- M-theory (learning framework)\n- Machine unlearning\n- Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference – A mathematical theory\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ The definition \"without being explicitly programmed\" is often attributed to Arthur Samuel, who coined the term \"machine learning\" in 1959, but the phrase is not found verbatim in this publication, and may be a paraphrase that appeared later.

          "content": "Artificial intelligence\nArtificial intelligence (AI or A.I.) is a computer program or a machine that is able to learn and mimic human cognition.[1][2] Sometimes, AI is used to talk about neural networks or deep learning.\nArtificial intelligence is a system's ability to understand external data, to learn from that data, and to use what it has learned to achieve specific goals or tasks through adaptation.[3]\nArtificial intelligence is widely applied in speech recognition, image recognition, robotics, autonomous systems, natural language processing, machine translation, predictive analytics, medical diagnostics, fraud detection, and the control of physical processes.\nOrigin of name\n[change | change source]John McCarthy Steve The Producer came up with the name, \"artificial intelligence\" in 1956. Intelligence allows an organism to act in a meaningful way in its environment. It includes the ability to get sensory inputs, and to react to these.\nLaws\n[change | change source]The European Union made a law (2024's second quarter) about artificial intelligence. It is the world's first law that regulates AI.[4]\nConnecticut and Colorado tried to pass laws (in 2024) regarding use of AI.[5]\nHistory\n[change | change source]AI research started with a conference at Dartmouth College in 1956. It was a month-long brainstorming session many people who like AI came to. At the conference, they wrote programs which were able to beat humans at checkers or solving word problems. The Department of Defense started giving a lot of money to AI research, and labs were created all over the world.\nIn a paper on AI, mathematician James Lighthill wrote \"no aspect of the discipline has so far seen discoveries generated the huge influence that was previously anticipated In no part of the field have the discoveries made so far produced the major impact that was then promised.\"[1]. The governments of the US and UK decided to spend money on other projects which caused little new research to be done. This was known as an \"AI winter.\"[6]\nIn the 90s and early 2000s, AI became important again in data mining and medical diagnosis. This was possible because of faster computers and focusing on solving more specific problems.\nIn 1997, the chess computer Deep Blue became the first computer program to beat chess world champion Garry Kasparov. In 2011, IBM Watson beat the top two Jeopardy! players Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings. In 2016, Google's AlphaGo beat top Go player Lee Sedol 4 out of 5 times.\nThe idea is perhaps much older. Julien Offray de La Mettrie (1709-1751) was a materialist thinker of the Enlightenment. In his work of 1748, L'Homme Machine, he had the idea that both matter and life organized themselves.[7] He is seen as one of the precursors of Darwin's theory of evolution.[8] Today, one field of artificial intelligence, called strong artificial intelligence wants to build a machine that can think like a person.[9] However, weak artificial intelligence is about building a system that can support a human. One of the key problems is to make systems that can model wikt:uncertainity. Most of the time, this is done with probability theory and statistics.\nUses of artificial intelligence\n[change | change source]Artificial intelligence is used in many different areas today.\n- Healthcare (see Artificial intelligence in healthcare) AI helps doctors diagnose diseases and find treatments for patients.\n- Industry-specific tasks; AI applications are used to solve problems in a workplace, industry, or institutions.\n- Finance: Banks use AI to find fraud and make trading decisions.\n- Customer service: Many companies use AI chatbots to answer customer questions and provide support.\n- Personal assistants: AI assistants like Siri and Alexa help people manage their daily tasks.\n- Entertainment: AI is used in video games to create smart, responsive characters and stories that change in fun ways based on what the player does. AI is used to create videos now-a-days by using different models like Sora.\nThose subjects are part of Game artificial intelligence.[10][11]\nSome software has become well-known, such as ChatGPT (a chatbot and virtual assistant).\nDomains of artificial intelligence\n[change | change source]There are different domains of artificial intelligence.\n- Pattern recognition like speech, writing, and handwriting\n- Knowledge engineering like logic programming and inference engines\n- Expert systems for question answering and Chatbots\n- Machine learning\n- Artificial neural networks and deep learning\n- Computer vision\n- Robotics\n- General game playing\n- Artificial life\nTypes (and classes) of artificial intelligence\n[change | change source]Researchers Kaplan and Haenlein say there are three types of AI system: analytical, human-inspired, and humanized artificial intelligence.[3]\n- Analytical A.I. has similarities with cognitive intelligence which tries to understand the world and make decisions based on that.\n- Human-inspired A.I. which tries to be more \"human\" with cognitive intelligence with emotional intelligence.\n- Humanized A.I. is able to understand human social activity and is able to be self aware[12]\nControversies regarding use of A.I.\n[change | change source]In 2025, a municipality in Norway made a report in regard to permanently closing down schools; The report used ghost source (or fictitious sources); Those sources were claimed to be the works of two (named) professors; The municipality admitted that the report was made [partly] by A.I.; The process of closing down schools, has stopped (as of March).[13] An official that was involved, resigned (or left her job) one month later.[14] (See Hallucination, artificial intelligence)\nOther information\n[change | change source]Researchers didn't know how difficult several issues were. They still couldn't offer computers things like emotions or common sense.\nFaster computers, deep learning, and more data have made AI popular throughout the world.[15]\nAn great intelligent machine is flexible and perceives what is around it. It would use what it learns to make its chance of success at some goal better.[16]\nAI has been successful with decoding human speech,[1] playing games (like chess and Go), self-driving cars, and understanding complex data.[17]\nSomeday, AI researchers hope to create computer programs that can learn, solve problems, and think logically.[18][19] So far, most AI programs only do what computers can do well like searching databases or doing calculations. AI is not able to sense and understand what is happening around itself because of problems with what computers can do.\nAI involves many different fields like computer science, mathematics, linguistics, psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy. Researchers hope to make a \"general artificial intelligence\" which can solve many problems instead of focusing on just one. Researchers are also trying to make creative and emotional AI which could create art. Alan Turing wrote in 1950 \"I propose to consider the question 'can machines think'?\"[20] He said the question should be changed from if a machine \"thinks\" to \"whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behavior\".[20] Alain Turing also created the Turing test. This is a very general test. If a human cannot tell if at the other end of the line, there is a machine or a human answering questions, the machine is intelligent.\nThe authors of Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach agree with Turing that AI must be defined by \"acting\" and not \"thinking\".[21] But they don't think the test compares machines to people. \"Aeronautical engineering texts do not define the goal of their field as making 'machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons.'\"[22] AI founder John McCarthy agreed, writing that \"Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence\".[23][24]\nComputers can do some things like learning and problem solving, but not in the same way as people do.[1]\nInterestingly, advancements in AI have expanded its applications, including the use of Large language models (LLMs) to \"humanize\" AI-generated text. This reflects a growing interest in bridging the gap between machine outputs and human-like expression. [25]\nAI and machine learning technology is used in applications including: search engines, recommendation systems, virtual assistants, autonomous vehicles, automatic language translation, facial recognition, image labeling, advertising, and driving internet traffic.\nOne interesting use of AI is in helping people with their personal relationships. For example, ChatGPT is a powerful AI tool that can create human-like text and assist in many communication tasks.[24]\nOptical character recognition is no longer thought of as an example of \"artificial intelligence\" since it's now commonly used.\nRelated pages\n[change | change source]- Data mining\n- Information storage systems (or Computer data storage)\n- OpenAI (a company)\nBooks\n[change | change source]- Russell, Stuart J.; Norvig, Peter.

          "content": "Mathematics\nMathematics is a field of study that discovers and organizes methods, theories and theorems that are developed and proved for the needs of empirical sciences and mathematics itself. There are many areas of mathematics, which include number theory (the study of numbers), algebra (the study of formulas and related structures), geometry (the study of shapes and spaces that contain them), analysis (the study of continuous changes), and set theory (presently used as a foundation for all mathematics).\nMathematics involves the description and manipulation of abstract objects that consist of either abstractions from nature or—in modern mathematics—purely abstract entities that are stipulated to have certain properties, called axioms. Mathematics uses pure reason to prove properties of objects, a proof consisting of a succession of applications of deductive rules to already established results. These results include previously proved theorems, axioms, and—in case of abstraction from nature—some basic properties that are considered true starting points of the theory under consideration.[1]\nMathematics is essential in the natural sciences, engineering, medicine, finance, computer science, and the social sciences. Although mathematics is extensively used for modeling phenomena, the fundamental truths of mathematics are independent of any scientific experimentation. Some areas of mathematics, such as statistics and game theory, are developed in close correlation with their applications and are often grouped under applied mathematics. Other areas are developed independently from any application (and are therefore called pure mathematics) but often later find practical applications.[2][3]\nHistorically, the concept of a proof and its associated mathematical rigour first appeared in Greek mathematics, most notably in Euclid's Elements.[4] Since its beginning, mathematics was primarily divided into geometry and arithmetic (the manipulation of natural numbers and fractions), until the 16th and 17th centuries, when algebra[a] and infinitesimal calculus were introduced as new fields. Since then, the interaction between mathematical innovations and scientific discoveries has led to a correlated increase in the development of both.[5] At the end of the 19th century, the foundational crisis of mathematics led to the systematization of the axiomatic method,[6] which heralded a dramatic increase in the number of mathematical areas and their fields of application. The contemporary Mathematics Subject Classification lists more than sixty first-level areas of mathematics.\nAreas of mathematics\nBefore the Renaissance, mathematics was divided into two main areas: arithmetic, regarding the manipulation of numbers, and geometry, regarding the study of shapes.[7] Some types of pseudoscience, such as numerology and astrology, were not then clearly distinguished from mathematics.[8]\nDuring the Renaissance, two more areas appeared. Mathematical notation led to algebra which, roughly speaking, consists of the study and the manipulation of formulas. Calculus, consisting of the two subfields differential calculus and integral calculus, is the study of continuous functions, which model the typically nonlinear relationships between varying quantities, as represented by variables. This division into four main areas—arithmetic, geometry, algebra, and calculus[9]—endured until the end of the 19th century. Areas such as celestial mechanics and solid mechanics were then studied by mathematicians, but now are considered as belonging to physics.[10] The subject of combinatorics has been studied for much of recorded history, yet did not become a separate branch of mathematics until the seventeenth century.[11]\nAt the end of the 19th century, the foundational crisis in mathematics and the resulting systematization of the axiomatic method led to an explosion of new areas of mathematics.[12][6] The 2020 Mathematics Subject Classification contains no less than sixty-three first-level areas.[13] Some of these areas correspond to the older division, as is true regarding number theory (the modern name for higher arithmetic) and geometry. Several other first-level areas have \"geometry\" in their names or are otherwise commonly considered part of geometry. Algebra and calculus do not appear as first-level areas but are respectively split into several first-level areas. Other first-level areas emerged during the 20th century or had not previously been considered as mathematics, such as mathematical logic and foundations.[14]\nNumber theory\nNumber theory began with the manipulation of numbers, that is, natural numbers and later expanded to integers and rational numbers Number theory was once called arithmetic, but nowadays this term is mostly used for numerical calculations.[15] Number theory dates back to ancient Babylon and probably China. Two prominent early number theorists were Euclid of ancient Greece and Diophantus of Alexandria.[16] The modern study of number theory in its abstract form is largely attributed to Pierre de Fermat and Leonhard Euler. The field came to full fruition with the contributions of Adrien-Marie Legendre and Carl Friedrich Gauss.[17]\nMany easily stated number problems have solutions that require sophisticated methods, often from across mathematics. A prominent example is Fermat's Last Theorem. This conjecture was stated in 1637 by Pierre de Fermat, but it was proved only in 1994 by Andrew Wiles, who used tools including scheme theory from algebraic geometry, category theory, and homological algebra.[18] Another example is Goldbach's conjecture, which asserts that every even integer greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers. Stated in 1742 by Christian Goldbach, it remains unproven despite considerable effort.[19]\nNumber theory includes several subareas, including analytic number theory, algebraic number theory, geometry of numbers (method oriented), diophantine equations, and transcendence theory (problem oriented).[14]\nGeometry\nGeometry is one of the oldest branches of mathematics. It started with empirical recipes concerning shapes, such as lines, angles and circles, which were developed mainly for the needs of surveying and architecture, but has since blossomed out into many other subfields.[20]\nA fundamental innovation was the ancient Greeks' introduction of the concept of proofs, which require that every assertion must be proved. For example, it is not sufficient to verify by measurement that, say, two lengths are equal; their equality must be proven via reasoning from previously accepted results (theorems) and a few basic statements. The basic statements are not subject to proof because they are self-evident (postulates), or are part of the definition of the subject of study (axioms). This principle, foundational for all mathematics, was first elaborated for geometry, and was systematized by Euclid around 300 BC in his book Elements.[21][22]\nThe resulting Euclidean geometry is the study of shapes and their arrangements constructed from lines, planes and circles in the Euclidean plane (plane geometry) and the three-dimensional Euclidean space.[b][20]\nEuclidean geometry was developed without change of methods or scope until the 17th century, when René Descartes introduced what is now called Cartesian coordinates. This constituted a major change of paradigm: Instead of defining real numbers as lengths of line segments (see number line), it allowed the representation of points using their coordinates, which are numbers. Algebra (and later, calculus) can thus be used to solve geometrical problems. Geometry was split into two new subfields: synthetic geometry, which uses purely geometrical methods, and analytic geometry, which uses coordinates systemically.[23]\nAnalytic geometry allows the study of curves unrelated to circles and lines. Such curves can be defined as the graph of functions, the study of which led to differential geometry. They can also be defined as implicit equations, often polynomial equations (which spawned algebraic geometry). Analytic geometry also makes it possible to consider Euclidean spaces of higher than three dimensions.[20]\nIn the 19th century, mathematicians discovered non-Euclidean geometries, which do not follow the parallel postulate. By questioning that postulate's truth, this discovery has been viewed as joining Russell's paradox in revealing the foundational crisis of mathematics. This aspect of the crisis was solved by systematizing the axiomatic method, and adopting that the truth of the chosen axioms is not a mathematical problem.[24][6] In turn, the axiomatic method allows for the study of various geometries obtained either by changing the axioms or by considering properties that do not change under specific transformations of the space.[25]\nToday's subareas of geometry include:[14]\n- Projective geometry, introduced in the 16th century by Girard Desargues, extends Euclidean geometry by adding points at infinity at which parallel lines intersect. This simplifies many aspects of classical geometry by unifying the treatments for intersecting and parallel lines.\n- Affine geometry, the study of properties relative to parallelism and independent from the concept of length.\n- Differential geometry, the study of curves, surfaces, and their generalizations, which are defined using differentiable functions.\n- Manifold theory, the study of shapes that are not necessarily embedded in a larger space.\n- Riemannian geometry, the study of distance properties in curved spaces.\n- Algebraic geometry, the study of curves, surfaces, and their generalizations, which are defined using polynomials.\n- Topology, the study of properties that are kept under continuous deformations.\n- Algebraic topology, the use in topology of algebraic methods, mainly homological algebra.\n- Discrete geometry, the study of finite configurations in geometry.\n- Convex geometry, the study of convex sets, which takes its importance from its applications in optimization.\n- Complex geometry, the geometry obtained by replacing real numbers with complex numbers.\nAlgebra\nAlgebra is the art of manipulating equations and formulas. Diophantus (3rd century) and al-Khwarizmi (9th century) were the two main precursors of algebra.[27][28] Diophantus solved some equations involving unknown natural numbers by deducing new relations until he obtained the solution.[29] Al-Khwarizmi introduced systematic methods for transforming equations, such as moving a term from one side of an equation into the other side.[30] The term algebra is derived from the Arabic word al-jabr meaning 'the reunion of broken parts' that he used for naming one of these methods in the title of his main treatise.[31][32]\nAlgebra became an area in its own right only with François Viète (1540–1603), who introduced the use of variables for representing unknown or unspecified numbers.[33] Variables allow mathematicians to describe the operations that have to be done on the numbers represented using mathematical formulas.[34]\nUntil the 19th century, algebra consisted mainly of the study of linear equations (presently linear algebra), and polynomial equations in a single unknown, which were called algebraic equations (a term still in use, although it may be ambiguous). During the 19th century, mathematicians began to use variables to represent things other than numbers (such as matrices, modular integers, and geometric transformations), on which generalizations of arithmetic operations are often valid.[35] The concept of algebraic structure addresses this, consisting of a set whose elements are unspecified, of operations acting on the elements of the set, and rules that these operations must follow. The scope of algebra thus grew to include the study of algebraic structures. This object of algebra was called modern algebra or abstract algebra, as established by the influence and works of Emmy Noether,[36] and popularized by Van der Waerden's book Moderne Algebra.\nSome types of algebraic structures have useful and often fundamental properties, in many areas of mathematics. Their study became autonomous parts of algebra, and include:[14]\n- group theory\n- field theory\n- vector spaces, whose study is essentially the same as linear algebra\n- ring theory\n- commutative algebra, which is the study of commutative rings, includes the study of polynomials, and is a foundational part of algebraic geometry\n- homological algebra\n- Lie algebra and Lie group theory\n- Boolean algebra, which is widely used for the study of the logical structure of computers\nThe study of types of algebraic structures as mathematical objects is the purpose of universal algebra and category theory.[37] The latter applies to every mathematical structure (not only algebraic ones). At its origin, it was introduced, together with homological algebra for allowing the algebraic study of non-algebraic objects such as topological spaces; this particular area of application is called algebraic topology.[38]\nCalculus and analysis\nCalculus, formerly called infinitesimal calculus, was introduced independently and simultaneously by 17th-century mathematicians Newton and Leibniz.[39] It is fundamentally the study of the relationship of variables that depend on each other. Calculus was expanded in the 18th century by Euler with the introduction of the concept of a function and many other results.[40] Presently, \"calculus\" refers mainly to the elementary part of this theory, and \"analysis\" is commonly used for advanced parts.[41]\nAnalysis is further subdivided into real analysis, where variables represent real numbers, and complex analysis, where variables represent complex numbers. Analysis includes many subareas shared by other areas of mathematics which include:[14]\n- Multivariable calculus\n- Functional analysis, where variables represent varying functions\n- Integration, measure theory and potential theory, all strongly related with probability theory on a continuum\n- Ordinary differential equations\n- Partial differential equations\n- Numerical analysis, mainly devoted to the computation on computers of solutions of ordinary and partial differential equations that arise in many applications\nDiscrete mathematics\nDiscrete mathematics, broadly speaking, is the study of individual, countable mathematical objects. An example is the set of all integers.[42] Because the objects of study here are discrete, the methods of calculus and mathematical analysis do not directly apply.[c] Algorithms—especially their implementation and computational complexity—play a major role in discrete mathematics.[43]\nThe four color theorem and optimal sphere packing were two major problems of discrete mathematics solved in the second half of the 20th century.[44] The P versus NP problem, which remains open to this day, is also important for discrete mathematics, since its solution would potentially impact a large number of computationally difficult problems.[45]\nDiscrete mathematics includes:[14]\n- Combinatorics, the art of enumerating mathematical objects that satisfy some given constraints. Originally, these objects were elements or subsets of a given set; this has been extended to various objects, which establishes a strong link between combinatorics and other parts of discrete mathematics. For example, discrete geometry includes counting configurations of geometric shapes.\n- Graph theory and hypergraphs\n- Coding theory, including error correcting codes and a part of cryptography\n- Matroid theory\n- Discrete geometry\n- Discrete probability distributions\n- Game theory (although continuous games are also studied, most common games, such as chess and poker are discrete)\n- Discrete optimization, including combinatorial optimization, integer programming, constraint programming\nMathematical logic and set theory\nThe two subjects of mathematical logic and set theory have belonged to mathematics since the end of the 19th century.[46][47] Before this period, sets were not considered to be mathematical objects, and logic, although used for mathematical proofs, belonged to philosophy and was not specifically studied by mathematicians.[48]\nBefore Cantor's study of infinite sets, mathematicians were reluctant to consider actually infinite collections, and considered infinity to be the result of endless enumeration. Cantor's work offended many mathematicians not only by considering actually infinite sets[49] but by showing that this implies different sizes of infinity, per Cantor's diagonal argument. This led to the controversy over Cantor's set theory.[50] In the same period, various areas of mathematics concluded the former intuitive definitions of the basic mathematical objects were insufficient for ensuring mathematical rigour.[51]\nThis became the foundational crisis of mathematics.[52] It was eventually solved in mainstream mathematics by systematizing the axiomatic method inside a formalized set theory. Roughly speaking, each mathematical object is defined by the set of all similar objects and the properties that these objects must have.[12] For example, in Peano arithmetic, the natural numbers are defined by \"zero is a number\", \"each number has a unique successor\", \"each number but zero has a unique predecessor\", and some rules of reasoning.[53] This mathematical abstraction from reality is embodied in the modern philosophy of formalism, as founded by David Hilbert around 1910.[54]\nThe \"nature\" of the objects defined this way is a philosophical problem that mathematicians leave to philosophers, even if many mathematicians have opinions on this nature, and use their opinion—sometimes called \"intuition\"—to guide their study and proofs. The approach allows considering \"logics\" (that is, sets of allowed deducing rules), theorems, proofs, etc. as mathematical objects, and to prove theorems about them. For example, Gödel's incompleteness theorems assert, roughly speaking that, in every consistent formal system that contains the natural numbers, there are theorems that are true (that is provable in a stronger system), but not provable inside the system.[55] This approach to the foundations of mathematics was challenged during the first half of the 20th century by mathematicians led by Brouwer, who promoted intuitionistic logic, which explicitly lacks the law of excluded middle.[56][57]\nThese problems and debates led to a wide expansion of mathematical logic, with subareas such as model theory (modeling some logical theories inside other theories), proof theory, type theory, computability theory and computational complexity theory.[14] Although these aspects of mathematical logic were introduced before the rise of computers, their use in compiler design, formal verification, program analysis, proof assistants and other aspects of computer science, contributed in turn to the expansion of these logical theories.[58]\nStatistics and other decision sciences\nThe field of statistics is a mathematical application that is employed for the collection and processing of data samples, using procedures based on mathematical methods especially probability theory. Statisticians generate data with random sampling or randomized experiments.[60]\nStatistical theory studies decision problems such as minimizing the risk (expected loss) of a statistical action, such as using a procedure in, for example, parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and selecting the best. In these traditional areas of mathematical statistics, a statistical-decision problem is formulated by minimizing an objective function, like expected loss or cost, under specific constraints. For example, designing a survey often involves minimizing the cost of estimating a population mean with a given level of confidence.[61] Because of its use of optimization, the mathematical theory of statistics overlaps with other decision sciences, such as operations research, control theory, and mathematical economics.[62]\nComputational mathematics\nComputational mathematics is the study of mathematical problems that are typically too large for human, numerical capacity.[63][64] Numerical analysis studies methods for problems in analysis using functional analysis and approximation theory; numerical analysis broadly includes the study of approximation and discretization with special focus on rounding errors.[65] Numerical analysis and, more broadly, scientific computing also study non-analytic topics of mathematical science, especially algorithmic-matrix-and-graph theory. Other areas of computational mathematics include computer algebra and symbolic computation.\nHistory\nEtymology\nThe word mathematics comes from the Ancient Greek word máthēma (μάθημα), meaning 'something learned, knowledge, mathematics', and the derived expression mathēmatikḗ tékhnē (μαθηματικὴ τέχνη), meaning 'mathematical science'. It entered the English language during the Late Middle English period through French and Latin.[66]\nSimilarly, one of the two main schools of thought in Pythagoreanism was known as the mathēmatikoi (μαθηματικοί)—which at the time meant \"learners\" rather than \"mathematicians\" in the modern sense. The Pythagoreans were likely the first to constrain the use of the word to just the study of arithmetic and geometry. By the time of Aristotle (384–322 BC) this meaning was fully established.[67]\nIn Latin and English, until around 1700, the term mathematics more commonly meant \"astrology\" (or sometimes \"astronomy\") rather than \"mathematics\"; the meaning gradually changed to its present one from about 1500 to 1800. This change has resulted in several mistranslations: For example, Saint Augustine's warning that Christians should beware of mathematici, meaning \"astrologers\", is sometimes mistranslated as a condemnation of mathematicians.[68]\nThe apparent plural form in English goes back to the Latin neuter plural mathematica (Cicero), based on the Greek plural ta mathēmatiká (τὰ μαθηματικά) and means roughly \"all things mathematical\", although it is plausible that English borrowed only the adjective mathematic(al) and formed the noun mathematics anew, after the pattern of physics and metaphysics, inherited from Greek.[69] In English, the noun mathematics takes a singular verb. It is often shortened to maths[70] or, in North America, math.[71]\nAncient\nIn addition to recognizing how to count physical objects, prehistoric peoples may have also known how to count abstract quantities, like time—days, seasons, or years.[72][73] Evidence for more complex mathematics does not appear until around 3000 BC, when the Babylonians and Egyptians began using arithmetic, algebra, and geometry for taxation and other financial calculations, for building and construction, and for astronomy.[74] The oldest mathematical texts from Mesopotamia and Egypt are from 2000 to 1800 BC.[75] Many early texts mention Pythagorean triples and so, by inference, the Pythagorean theorem seems to be the most ancient and widespread mathematical concept after basic arithmetic and geometry. It is in Babylonian mathematics that elementary arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) first appear in the archaeological record. The Babylonians also possessed a place-value system and used a sexagesimal numeral system which is still in use today for measuring angles and time.[76]\nIn the 6th century BC, Greek mathematics began to emerge as a distinct discipline and some Ancient Greeks such as the Pythagoreans appeared to have considered it a subject in its own right.[77] Around 300 BC, Euclid organized mathematical knowledge by way of postulates and first principles, which evolved into the axiomatic method that is used in mathematics today, consisting of definition, axiom, theorem, and proof.[78] His book, Elements, is widely considered the most successful and influential textbook of all time.[79] The greatest mathematician of antiquity is often held to be Archimedes (c. 287 – c. 212 BC) of Syracuse.[80] He developed formulas for calculating the surface area and volume of solids of revolution and used the method of exhaustion to calculate the area under the arc of a parabola with the summation of an infinite series, in a manner not too dissimilar from modern calculus.[81] Other notable achievements of Greek mathematics are conic sections (Apollonius of Perga, 3rd century BC),[82] trigonometry (Hipparchus of Nicaea, 2nd century BC),[83] and the beginnings of algebra (Diophantus, 3rd century AD).[84]\nThe Hindu–Arabic numeral system and the rules for the use of its operations, in use throughout the world today, evolved over the course of the first millennium AD in India and were transmitted to the Western world via Islamic mathematics.[85] Other notable developments of Indian mathematics include the modern definition and approximation of sine and cosine, and an early form of infinite series.[86][87]\nMedieval and later\nDuring the Golden Age of Islam, especially during the 9th and 10th centuries, mathematics saw many important innovations building on Greek mathematics. The most notable achievement of Islamic mathematics was the development of algebra. Other achievements of the Islamic period include advances in spherical trigonometry and the addition of the decimal point to the Arabic numeral system.[88] Many notable mathematicians from this period were Persian, such as Al-Khwarizmi, Omar Khayyam and Sharaf al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī.[89] The Greek and Arabic mathematical texts were in turn translated to Latin during the Middle Ages and made available in Europe.[90]\nDuring the early modern period, mathematics began to develop at an accelerating pace in Western Europe, with innovations that revolutionized mathematics, such as the introduction of variables and symbolic notation by François Viète (1540–1603), the introduction of logarithms by John Napier in 1614, which greatly simplified numerical calculations, especially for astronomy and marine navigation, the introduction of coordinates by René Descartes (1596–1650) for reducing geometry to algebra, and the development of calculus by Isaac Newton (1643–1727) and Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716). Leonhard Euler (1707–1783), the most notable mathematician of the 18th century, unified these innovations into a single corpus with a standardized terminology, and completed them with the discovery and the proof of numerous theorems.[91]\nPerhaps the foremost mathematician of the 19th century was the German mathematician Carl Gauss, who made numerous contributions to fields such as algebra, analysis, differential geometry, matrix theory, number theory, and statistics.[92] In the early 20th century, Kurt Gödel transformed mathematics by publishing his incompleteness theorems, which show in part that any consistent axiomatic system—if powerful enough to describe arithmetic—will contain true propositions that cannot be proved.[55]\nMathematics has since been greatly extended, and there has been a fruitful interaction between mathematics and science, to the benefit of both. Mathematical discoveries continue to be made to this very day. According to Mikhail B. Sevryuk, in the January 2006 issue of the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, \"The number of papers and books included in the Mathematical Reviews (MR) database since 1940 (the first year of operation of MR) is now more than 1.9 million, and more than 75 thousand items are added to the database each year. The overwhelming majority of works in this ocean contain new mathematical theorems and their proofs.\"[93]\nSymbolic notation and terminology\nMathematical notation is widely used in science and engineering for representing complex concepts and properties in a concise, unambiguous, and accurate way. This notation consists of symbols used for representing operations, unspecified numbers, relations and any other mathematical objects, and then assembling them into expressions and formulas.[94] More precisely, numbers and other mathematical objects are represented by symbols called variables, which are generally Latin or Greek letters, and often include subscripts. Operation and relations are generally represented by specific symbols or glyphs,[95] such as + (plus), × (multiplication), (integral), = (equal), and < (less than).[96] All these symbols are generally grouped according to specific rules to form expressions and formulas.[97] Normally, expressions and formulas do not appear alone, but are included in sentences of the current language, where expressions play the role of noun phrases and formulas play the role of clauses.\nMathematics has developed a rich terminology covering a broad range of fields that study the properties of various abstract, idealized objects and how they interact. It is based on rigorous definitions that provide a standard foundation for communication. An axiom or postulate is a mathematical statement that is taken to be true without need of proof. If a mathematical statement has yet to be proven (or disproven), it is termed a conjecture. Through a series of rigorous arguments employing deductive reasoning, a statement that is proven to be true becomes a theorem. A specialized theorem that is mainly used to prove another theorem is called a lemma. A proven instance that forms part of a more general finding is termed a corollary.[98]\nNumerous technical terms used in mathematics are neologisms, such as polynomial and homeomorphism.[99] Other technical terms are words of the common language that are used in an accurate meaning that may differ slightly from their common meaning. For example, in mathematics, \"or\" means \"one, the other or both\", while, in common language, it is either ambiguous or means \"one or the other but not both\" (in mathematics, the latter is called \"exclusive or\"). Finally, many mathematical terms are common words that are used with a completely different meaning.[100] This may lead to sentences that are correct and true mathematical assertions, but appear to be nonsense to people who do not have the required background. For example, \"every free module is flat\" and \"a field is always a ring\".\nRelationship with sciences\nMathematics is used in most sciences for modeling phenomena, which then allows predictions to be made from experimental laws.[101] The independence of mathematical truth from any experimentation implies that the accuracy of such predictions depends only on the adequacy of the model.[102] Inaccurate predictions, rather than being caused by invalid mathematical concepts, imply the need to change the mathematical model used.[103] For example, the perihelion precession of Mercury could only be explained after the emergence of Einstein's general relativity, which replaced Newton's law of gravitation as a better mathematical model.[104]\nThere is still a philosophical debate whether mathematics is a science. However, in practice, mathematicians are typically grouped with scientists, and mathematics shares much in common with the physical sciences. Like them, it is falsifiable, which means in mathematics that, if a result or a theory is wrong, this can be proved by providing a counterexample. Similarly as in science, theories and results (theorems) are often obtained from experimentation.[105] In mathematics, the experimentation may consist of computation on selected examples or of the study of figures or other representations of mathematical objects (often mind representations without physical support). For example, when asked how he came about his theorems, Gauss once replied \"durch planmässiges Tattonieren\" (through systematic experimentation).[106] However, some authors emphasize that mathematics differs from the modern notion of science by not relying on empirical evidence.[107][108][109][110]\nPure and applied mathematics\nUntil the 19th century, the development of mathematics in the West was mainly motivated by the needs of technology and science, and there was no clear distinction between pure and applied mathematics.[111] For example, the natural numbers and arithmetic were introduced for the need of counting, and geometry was motivated by surveying, architecture and astronomy. Later, Isaac Newton introduced infinitesimal calculus for explaining the movement of the planets with his law of gravitation. Moreover, most mathematicians were also scientists, and many scientists were also mathematicians.[112] However, a notable exception occurred with the tradition of pure mathematics in Ancient Greece.[113] The problem of integer factorization, for example, which goes back to Euclid in 300 BC, had no practical application before its use in the RSA cryptosystem, now widely used for the security of computer networks.[114]\nIn the 19th century, mathematicians such as Karl Weierstrass and Richard Dedekind increasingly focused their research on internal problems, that is, pure mathematics.[111][115] This led to split mathematics into pure mathematics and applied mathematics, the latter being often considered as having a lower value among mathematical purists. However, the lines between the two are frequently blurred.[116]\nThe aftermath of World War II led to a surge in the development of applied mathematics in the US and elsewhere.[117][118] Many of the theories developed for applications were found interesting from the point of view of pure mathematics, and many results of pure mathematics were shown to have applications outside mathematics; in turn, the study of these applications may give new insights on the \"pure theory\".[119][120]\nAn example of the first case is the theory of distributions, introduced by Laurent Schwartz for validating computations done in quantum mechanics, which became immediately an important tool of (pure) mathematical analysis.[121] An example of the second case is the decidability of the first-order theory of the real numbers, a problem of pure mathematics that was proved true by Alfred Tarski, with an algorithm that is impossible to implement because of a computational complexity that is much too high.[122] For getting an algorithm that can be implemented and can solve systems of polynomial equations and inequalities, George Collins introduced the cylindrical algebraic decomposition that became a fundamental tool in real algebraic geometry.[123]\nIn the present day, the distinction between pure and applied mathematics is more a question of personal research aim of mathematicians than a division of mathematics into broad areas.[124][125] The Mathematics Subject Classification has a section for \"general applied mathematics\" but does not mention \"pure mathematics\".[14] However, these terms are still used in names of some university departments, such as at the Faculty of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge.\nUnreasonable effectiveness\nThe unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics is a phenomenon that was named and first made explicit by physicist Eugene Wigner.[3] It is the fact that many mathematical theories (even the \"purest\") have applications outside their initial object. These applications may be completely outside their initial area of mathematics, and may concern physical phenomena that were completely unknown when the mathematical theory was introduced.[126] Examples of unexpected applications of mathematical theories can be found in many areas of mathematics.\nA notable example is the prime factorization of natural numbers that was discovered more than 2,000 years before its common use for secure internet communications through the RSA cryptosystem.[127] A second historical example is the theory of ellipses. They were studied by the ancient Greek mathematicians as conic sections (that is, intersections of cones with planes). It was almost 2,000 years later that Johannes Kepler discovered that the trajectories of the planets are ellipses.[128]\nIn the 19th century, the internal development of geometry (pure mathematics) led to definition and study of non-Euclidean geometries, spaces of dimension higher than three and manifolds. At this time, these concepts seemed totally disconnected from the physical reality, but at the beginning of the 20th century, Albert Einstein developed the theory of relativity that uses fundamentally these concepts. In particular, spacetime of special relativity is a non-Euclidean space of dimension four, and spacetime of general relativity is a (curved) manifold of dimension four.[129][130]\nA striking aspect of the interaction between mathematics and physics is when mathematics drives research in physics. This is illustrated by the discoveries of the positron and the baryon In both cases, the equations of the theories had unexplained solutions, which led to conjecture of the existence of an unknown particle, and the search for these particles. In both cases, these particles were discovered a few years later by specific experiments.[131][132][133]\nSpecific sciences\nPhysics\nMathematics and physics have influenced each other over their modern history. Modern physics uses mathematics abundantly,[134] and is also considered to be the motivation of major mathematical developments.[135]\nComputing\nComputing is closely related to mathematics in several ways.[136] Theoretical computer science is considered to be mathematical in nature.[137] Communication technologies apply branches of mathematics that may be very old (e.g., arithmetic), especially with respect to transmission security, in cryptography and coding theory. Discrete mathematics is useful in many areas of computer science, such as complexity theory, information theory, and graph theory.[138] In 1998, the Kepler conjecture on sphere packing seemed to also be partially proven by computer.[139]\nBiology and chemistry\nBiology uses probability extensively in fields such as ecology or neurobiology.[140] Most discussion of probability centers on the concept of evolutionary fitness.[140] Ecology heavily uses modeling to simulate population dynamics,[140][141] study ecosystems such as the predator-prey model, measure pollution diffusion,[142] or to assess climate change.[143] The dynamics of a population can be modeled by coupled differential equations, such as the Lotka–Volterra equations.[144]\nStatistical hypothesis testing, is run on data from clinical trials to determine whether a new treatment works.[145] Since the start of the 20th century, chemistry has used computing to model molecules in three dimensions.[146]\nEarth sciences\nStructural geology and climatology use probabilistic models to predict the risk of natural catastrophes.[147] Similarly, meteorology, oceanography, and planetology also use mathematics due to their heavy use of models.[148][149][150]\nSocial sciences\nAreas of mathematics used in the social sciences include probability/statistics and differential equations. These are used in linguistics, economics, sociology,[151] and psychology.[152]\nOften the fundamental postulate of mathematical economics is that of the rational individual actor – Homo economicus (lit. 'economic man').[153] In this model, the individual seeks to maximize their self-interest,[153] and always makes optimal choices using perfect information.[154] This atomistic view of economics allows it to relatively easily mathematize its thinking, because individual calculations are transposed into mathematical calculations. Such mathematical modeling allows one to probe economic mechanisms. Some reject or criticise the concept of Homo economicus. Economists note that real people have limited information, make poor choices and care about fairness, altruism, not just personal gain.[155]\nWithout mathematical modeling, it is hard to go beyond statistical observations or untestable speculation. Mathematical modeling allows economists to create structured frameworks to test hypotheses and analyze complex interactions. Models provide clarity and precision, enabling the translation of theoretical concepts into quantifiable predictions that can be tested against real-world data.[156]\nAt the start of the 20th century, there was a development to express historical movements in formulas. In 1922, Nikolai Kondratiev discerned the ~50-year-long Kondratiev cycle, which explains phases of economic growth or crisis.[157] Towards the end of the 19th century, mathematicians extended their analysis into geopolitics.[158] Peter Turchin developed cliodynamics since the 1990s.[159]\nMathematization of the social sciences is not without risk. In the controversial book Fashionable Nonsense (1997), Sokal and Bricmont denounced the unfounded or abusive use of scientific terminology, particularly from mathematics or physics, in the social sciences.[160] The study of complex systems (evolution of unemployment, business capital, demographic evolution of a population, etc.) uses mathematical knowledge. However, the choice of counting criteria, particularly for unemployment, or of models, can be subject to controversy.[161][162]\nPhilosophy\nReality\nThe connection between mathematics and material reality has led to philosophical debates since at least the time of Pythagoras. The ancient philosopher Plato argued that abstractions that reflect material reality have themselves a reality that exists outside space and time. As a result, the philosophical view that mathematical objects somehow exist on their own in abstraction is often referred to as Platonism. Independently of their possible philosophical opinions, modern mathematicians may be generally considered as Platonists, since they think of and talk of their objects of study as real objects.[163]\nArmand Borel summarized this view of mathematics reality as follows, and provided quotations of G. H. Hardy, Charles Hermite, Henri Poincaré and Albert Einstein that support his views.[131]\nSomething becomes objective (as opposed to \"subjective\") as soon as we are convinced that it exists in the minds of others in the same form as it does in ours and that we can think about it and discuss it together.[164] Because the language of mathematics is so precise, it is ideally suited to defining concepts for which such a consensus exists. In my opinion, that is sufficient to provide us with a feeling of an objective existence, of a reality of mathematics ...\nNevertheless, Platonism and the concurrent views on abstraction do not explain the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics (as Platonism assumes mathematics exists independently, but does not explain why it matches reality).[165]\nProposed definitions\nThere is no general consensus about the definition of mathematics or its epistemological status—that is, its place inside knowledge. A great many professional mathematicians take no interest in a definition of mathematics, or consider it undefinable. There is not even consensus on whether mathematics is an art or a science. Some just say, \"mathematics is what mathematicians do\".[166][167] A common approach is to define mathematics by its object of study.[168][169][170][171]\nAristotle defined mathematics as \"the science of quantity\" and this definition prevailed until the 18th century. However, Aristotle also noted a focus on quantity alone may not distinguish mathematics from sciences like physics; in his view, abstraction and studying quantity as a property \"separable in thought\" from real instances set mathematics apart.[172] In the 19th century, when mathematicians began to address topics—such as infinite sets—which have no clear-cut relation to physical reality, a variety of new definitions were given.[173] With the large number of new areas of mathematics that have appeared since the beginning of the 20th century, defining mathematics by its object of study has become increasingly difficult.[174] For example, in lieu of a definition, Saunders Mac Lane in Mathematics, form and function summarizes the basics of several areas of mathematics, emphasizing their inter-connectedness, and observes:[175]\nthe development of Mathematics provides a tightly connected network of formal rules, concepts, and systems. Nodes of this network are closely bound to procedures useful in human activities and to questions arising in science. The transition from activities to the formal Mathematical systems is guided by a variety of general insights and ideas.\nAnother approach for defining mathematics is to use its methods. For example, an area of study is often qualified as mathematics as soon as one can prove theorems—assertions whose validity relies on a proof, that is, a purely-logical deduction.[d][176][failed verification]\nRigor\nMathematical reasoning requires rigor. This means that the definitions must be absolutely unambiguous and the proofs must be reducible to a succession of applications of inference rules,[e] without any use of empirical evidence and intuition.[f][177] Rigorous reasoning is not specific to mathematics, but, in mathematics, the standard of rigor is much higher than elsewhere. Despite mathematics' concision, rigorous proofs can require hundreds of pages to express, such as the 255-page Feit–Thompson theorem.[g] The emergence of computer-assisted proofs has allowed proof lengths to further expand.[h][178] The result of this trend is a philosophy of the quasi-empiricist proof that can not be considered infallible, but has a probability attached to it.[6]\nThe concept of rigor in mathematics dates back to ancient Greece, where their society encouraged logical, deductive reasoning. However, this rigorous approach would tend to discourage exploration of new approaches, such as irrational numbers and concepts of infinity. The method of demonstrating rigorous proof was enhanced in the sixteenth century through the use of symbolic notation. In the 18th century, social transition led to mathematicians earning their keep through teaching, which led to more careful thinking about the underlying concepts of mathematics. This produced more rigorous approaches, while transitioning from geometric methods to algebraic and then arithmetic proofs.[6]\nAt the end of the 19th century, it appeared that the definitions of the basic concepts of mathematics were not accurate enough for avoiding paradoxes (non-Euclidean geometries and Weierstrass function) and contradictions (Russell's paradox). This was solved by the inclusion of axioms with the apodictic inference rules of mathematical theories; the re-introduction of axiomatic method pioneered by the ancient Greeks.[6] It results that \"rigor\" is no more a relevant concept in mathematics, as a proof is either correct or erroneous, and a \"rigorous proof\" is simply a pleonasm. Where a special concept of rigor comes into play is in the socialized aspects of a proof, wherein it may be demonstrably refuted by other mathematicians. After a proof has been accepted for many years or even decades, it can then be considered as reliable.[179]\nNevertheless, the concept of \"rigor\" may remain useful for teaching to beginners what is a mathematical proof.[180]\nTraining and practice\nEducation\nMathematics has a remarkable ability to cross cultural boundaries and time periods. As a human activity, the practice of mathematics has a social side, which includes education, careers, recognition, popularization, and so on. In education, mathematics is a core part of the curriculum and forms an important element of the STEM academic disciplines. Prominent careers for professional mathematicians include mathematics teacher or professor, statistician, actuary, financial analyst, economist, accountant, commodity trader, or computer consultant.[181]\nArchaeological evidence shows that instruction in mathematics occurred as early as the second millennium BCE in ancient Babylonia.[182] Comparable evidence has been unearthed for scribal mathematics training in the ancient Near East and then for the Greco-Roman world starting around 300 BCE.[183] The oldest known mathematics textbook is the Rhind papyrus, dated from c. 1650 BCE in Egypt.[184] Due to a scarcity of books, mathematical teachings in ancient India were communicated using memorized oral tradition since the Vedic period (c. 1500 – c. 500 BCE).[185] In Imperial China during the Tang dynasty (618–907 CE), a mathematics curriculum was adopted for the civil service exam to join the state bureaucracy.[186]\nFollowing the Dark Ages, mathematics education in Europe was provided by religious schools as part of the Quadrivium. Formal instruction in pedagogy began with Jesuit schools in the 16th and 17th century. Most mathematical curricula remained at a basic and practical level until the nineteenth century, when it began to flourish in France and Germany. The oldest journal addressing instruction in mathematics was L'Enseignement Mathématique, which began publication in 1899.[187] The Western advancements in science and technology led to the establishment of centralized education systems in many nation-states, with mathematics as a core component—initially for its military applications.[188] While the content of courses varies, in the present day nearly all countries teach mathematics to students for significant amounts of time.[189]\nDuring school, mathematical capabilities and positive expectations have a strong association with career interest in the field. Extrinsic factors such as feedback motivation by teachers, parents, and peer groups can influence the level of interest in mathematics.[190] Some students studying mathematics may develop an apprehension or fear about their performance in the subject. This is known as mathematical anxiety, and is considered the most prominent of the disorders impacting academic performance. Mathematical anxiety can develop due to various factors such as parental and teacher attitudes, social stereotypes, and personal traits. Help to counteract the anxiety can come from changes in instructional approaches, by interactions with parents and teachers, and by tailored treatments for the individual.[191]\nPsychology (aesthetic, creativity and intuition)\nThe validity of a mathematical theorem relies only on the rigor of its proof, which could theoretically be done automatically by a computer program. This does not mean that there is no place for creativity in a mathematical work. On the contrary, many important mathematical results (theorems) are solutions of problems that other mathematicians failed to solve, and the invention of a way for solving them may be a fundamental way of the solving process.[192][193] An extreme example is Apery's theorem: Roger Apery provided only the ideas for a proof, and the formal proof was given only several months later by three other mathematicians.[194]\nCreativity and rigor are not the only psychological aspects of the activity of mathematicians. Some mathematicians can see their activity as a game, more specifically as solving puzzles.[195] This aspect of mathematical activity is emphasized in recreational mathematics.\nMathematicians can find an aesthetic value to mathematics. Like beauty, it is hard to define, it is commonly related to elegance, which involves qualities like simplicity, symmetry, completeness, and generality. G. H. Hardy in A Mathematician's Apology expressed the belief that the aesthetic considerations are, in themselves, sufficient to justify the study of pure mathematics. He also identified other criteria such as significance, unexpectedness, and inevitability, which contribute to mathematical aesthetics.[196] Paul Erdős expressed this sentiment more ironically by speaking of \"The Book\", a supposed divine collection of the most beautiful proofs. The 1998 book Proofs from THE BOOK, inspired by Erdős, is a collection of particularly succinct and revelatory mathematical arguments. Some examples of particularly elegant results included are Euclid's proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers and the fast Fourier transform for harmonic analysis.[197]\nSome feel that to consider mathematics a science is to downplay its artistry and history in the seven traditional liberal arts.[198] One way this difference of viewpoint plays out is in the philosophical debate as to whether mathematical results are created (as in art) or discovered (as in science).[131] The popularity of recreational mathematics is another sign of the pleasure many find in solving mathematical questions.\nCultural impact\nArtistic expression\nNotes that sound well together to a Western ear are sounds whose fundamental frequencies of vibration are in simple ratios. For example, an octave doubles the frequency and a perfect fifth multiplies it by .[199][200]\nHumans, as well as some other animals, find symmetric patterns to be more beautiful.[201] Mathematically, the symmetries of an object form a group known as the symmetry group.[202] For example, the group underlying mirror symmetry is the cyclic group of two elements, . A Rorschach test is a figure invariant by this symmetry,[203] as are butterfly and animal bodies more generally (at least on the surface).[204] Waves on the sea surface possess translation symmetry: moving one's viewpoint by the distance between wave crests does not change one's view of the sea.[205] Fractals possess self-similarity.[206][207]\nPopularization\nPopular mathematics is the act of presenting mathematics without technical terms.[208] Presenting mathematics may be hard since the general public suffers from mathematical anxiety and mathematical objects are highly abstract.[209] However, popular mathematics writing can overcome this by using applications or cultural links.[210] Despite this, mathematics is rarely the topic of popularization in printed or televised media.\nAwards and prize problems\nThe most prestigious award in mathematics is the Fields Medal,[211][212] established in 1936 and awarded every four years (except around World War II) to up to four individuals.[213][214] It is considered the mathematical equivalent of the Nobel Prize.[214]\nOther prestigious mathematics awards include:[215]\n- The Abel Prize, instituted in 2002[216] and first awarded in 2003[217]\n- The Chern Medal for lifetime achievement, introduced in 2009[218] and first awarded in 2010[219]\n- The AMS Leroy P. Steele Prize, awarded since 1970[220]\n- The Wolf Prize in Mathematics, also for lifetime achievement,[221] instituted in 1978[222]\nA famous list of 23 open problems, called \"Hilbert's problems\", was compiled in 1900 by German mathematician David Hilbert.[223] This list has achieved great celebrity among mathematicians,[224] and at least thirteen of the problems (depending how some are interpreted) have been solved.[223]\nA new list of seven important problems, titled the \"Millennium Prize Problems\", was published in 2000. Only one of them, the Riemann hypothesis, duplicates one of Hilbert's problems. A solution to any of these problems carries a 1 million dollar reward.[225] To date, only one of these problems, the Poincaré conjecture, has been solved by the Russian mathematician Grigori Perelman.[226]\nSee also\n- Law (mathematics)\n- List of mathematical jargon\n- Lists of mathematicians\n- Lists of mathematics topics\n- Mathematical constant\n- Mathematical sciences\n- Mathematics and art\n- Mathematics education\n- Philosophy of mathematics\n- Relationship between mathematics and physics\n- Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics\nNotes\n- ^ Here, algebra is taken in its modern sense, which is, roughly speaking, the art of manipulating formulas.\n- ^ This includes conic sections, which are intersections of circular cylinders and planes.\n- ^ However, some advanced methods of analysis are sometimes used; for example, methods of complex analysis applied to generating series.\n- ^ For example, logic belongs to philosophy since Aristotle.

It deals with logical reasoning and quantitative calculation, and its development has involved an increasing degree of idealization and abstraction of its subject matter. Since the 17th century, mathematics has been an indispensable adjunct to the physical sciences and technology, and in more recent times it has assumed a similar role in the quantitative aspects of the life sciences.\nIn many cultures—under the stimulus of the needs of practical pursuits, such as commerce and agriculture—mathematics has developed far beyond basic counting. This growth has been greatest in societies complex enough to sustain these activities and to provide leisure for contemplation and the opportunity to build on the achievements of earlier mathematicians.\nAll mathematical systems (for example, Euclidean geometry) are combinations of sets of axioms and of theorems that can be logically deduced from the axioms. Inquiries into the logical and philosophical basis of mathematics reduce to questions of whether the axioms of a given system ensure its completeness and its consistency. For full treatment of this aspect, see mathematics, foundations of.\nThis article offers a history of mathematics from ancient times to the present. As a consequence of the exponential growth of science, most mathematics has developed since the 15th century ce, and it is a historical fact that, from the 15th century to the late 20th century, new developments in mathematics were largely concentrated in Europe and North America. For these reasons, the bulk of this article is devoted to European developments since 1500.\nThis does not mean, however, that developments elsewhere have been unimportant. Indeed, to understand the history of mathematics in Europe, it is necessary to know its history at least in ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt, in ancient Greece, and in Islamic civilization from the 9th to the 15th century. The way in which these civilizations influenced one another and the important direct contributions Greece and Islam made to later developments are discussed in the first parts of this article.\nIndia’s contributions to the development of contemporary mathematics were made through the considerable influence of Indian achievements on Islamic mathematics during its formative years. A separate article, South Asian mathematics, focuses on the early history of mathematics in the Indian subcontinent and the development there of the modern decimal place-value numeral system. The article East Asian mathematics covers the mostly independent development of mathematics in China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam.\nThe substantive branches of mathematics are treated in several articles. See algebra; analysis; arithmetic; combinatorics; game theory; geometry; number theory; numerical analysis; optimization; probability theory; set theory; statistics; trigonometry.",

          "content": "What is Mathematics?\nMathematics is the science and study of quality, structure, space, and change. Mathematicians seek out patterns, formulate new conjectures, and establish truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions.\nThere is debate over whether mathematical objects such as numbers and points exist naturally or are human creations. The mathematician Benjamin Peirce called mathematics \"the science that draws necessary conclusions\". Albert Einstein, on the other hand, stated that \"as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.\"\nThrough abstraction and logical reasoning mathematics evolved from counting, calculation, measurement, and the systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical objects. Practical mathematics has been a human activity for as far back as written records exist. Rigorous arguments first appeared in Greek mathematics, most notably in Euclid's Elements. Mathematics continued to develop, in fitful bursts, until the Renaissance, when mathematical innovations interacted with new scientific discoveries, leading to an acceleration in research that continues to the present day.\nToday, mathematics is used throughout the world as an essential tool in many fields, including natural science, engineering, medicine, and the social sciences. Applied mathematics, the branch of mathematics concerned with application of mathematical knowledge to other fields, inspires and makes use of new mathematical discoveries and sometimes leads to the development of entirely new disciplines. Mathematicians also engage in pure mathematics, or mathematics for its own sake, without having any application in mind, although practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered later.",

          "content": "Mathematics\nMathematics is the study of numbers, shapes, and patterns. The word comes from the Greek μάθημα (máthema), meaning \"science, knowledge, or learning\", and is sometimes shortened to math or maths.\nIt is the study of:\n- Numbers: including how things can be counted.\n- Structure: including how things are organized, but also how they can be or could have been. This subfield is usually called algebra.\n- Place: where things are, and spatial arrangement, including arrangements of spaces themselves. This subfield is usually called geometry.\n- Change: how things become different. This subfield is usually called analysis.\nApplied math is useful for solving problems in the real world. People working in business, science, engineering, and construction use mathematics.[1][2]\nProblem-solving in mathematics\n[change | change source]Mathematics solves problems by using logic. One of the main tools of logic used by mathematicians is deduction. Deduction is a special way of thinking to discover and prove new truths using old truths. To a mathematician, the reason something is true (called a proof) is just as important as the fact that it is true, and this reason is often found using deduction. Using deduction is what makes mathematical thinking different from other kinds of scientific thinking, which might rely on experiments or on interviews.[3]\nLogic and reasoning are used by mathematicians to create general rules, which are an important part of mathematics. These rules leave out information that is not important so that a single rule can cover many situations. By finding general rules, mathematics solves many problems at the same time as these rules can be used on other problems.[4] These rules can be called theorems (if they have been proven) or conjectures (if it is not known if they are true yet).[5] Most mathematicians use non-logical and creative reasoning in order to find a logical proof.[6]\nSometimes, mathematics finds and studies rules or ideas that we don't understand yet. Often in mathematics, ideas and rules are chosen because they are considered simple or neat. On the other hand, sometimes these ideas and rules are found in the real world after they are studied in mathematics; this has happened many times in the past. In general, studying the rules and ideas of mathematics can help us understand the world better. Some examples of math problems are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, calculus, fractions and decimals. Algebra problems are solved by evaluating certain variables. A calculator answers every math problem in the four basic arithmetic operations.\nAreas of study in mathematics\n[change | change source]Number\n[change | change source]- Mathematics includes the study of numbers and quantities. It is a branch of science that deals with the logic of shape, quantity, and arrangement.

          "content": "Engineering\nEngineering is the practice of using natural science, mathematics, and the engineering design process[1] to solve problems within technology, increase efficiency and productivity, and improve systems. Modern engineering comprises many subfields which include designing and improving infrastructure, machinery, vehicles, electronics, materials, and energy systems.[2]\nThe discipline of engineering encompasses a broad range of more specialized fields of engineering, each with a more specific emphasis for applications of mathematics and science. See glossary of engineering.\nThe word engineering is derived from the Latin ingenium.[3]\nDefinition\nThe American Engineers' Council for Professional Development (the predecessor of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology aka ABET)[4] has defined \"engineering\" as:\nThe creative application of scientific principles to design or develop structures, machines, apparatus, or manufacturing processes, or works utilizing them singly or in combination; or to construct or operate the same with full cognizance of their design; or to forecast their behavior under specific operating conditions; all as respects an intended function, economics of operation and safety to life and property.[5][6]\nHistory\nEngineering has existed since ancient times, when humans devised inventions such as the wedge, lever, wheel and pulley, etc.\nThe term engineering is derived from the word engineer, which itself dates back to the 14th century when an engine'er (literally, one who builds or operates a siege engine) referred to \"a constructor of military engines\".[7] In this context, now obsolete, an \"engine\" referred to a military machine, i.e., a mechanical contraption used in war (for example, a catapult). Notable examples of the obsolete usage which have survived to the present day are military engineering corps, e.g., the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\nThe word \"engine\" itself is of even older origin, ultimately deriving from the Latin ingenium (c. 1250), meaning \"innate quality, especially mental power, hence a clever invention.\"[8]\nLater, as the design of civilian structures, such as bridges and buildings, matured as a technical discipline, the term civil engineering[6] entered the lexicon as a way to distinguish between those specializing in the construction of such non-military projects and those involved in the discipline of military engineering.\nAncient era\nThe pyramids in ancient Egypt, ziggurats of Mesopotamia, the Acropolis and Parthenon in Greece, the Roman aqueducts, Via Appia and Colosseum, Teotihuacán, and the Brihadeeswarar Temple of Thanjavur, among many others, stand as a testament to the ingenuity and skill of ancient civil and military engineers. Other monuments, no longer standing, such as the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and the Pharos of Alexandria, were important engineering achievements of their time and were considered among the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.\nThe six classic simple machines were known in the ancient Near East. The wedge and the inclined plane (ramp) were known since prehistoric times.[9] The wheel, along with the wheel and axle mechanism, was invented in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) during the 5th millennium BC.[10] The lever mechanism first appeared around 5,000 years ago in the Near East, where it was used in a simple balance scale,[11] and to move large objects in ancient Egyptian technology.[12] The lever was also used in the shadoof water-lifting device, the first crane machine, which appeared in Mesopotamia c. 3000 BC,[11] and then in ancient Egyptian technology c. 2000 BC.[13] The earliest evidence of pulleys date back to Mesopotamia in the early 2nd millennium BC,[14] and ancient Egypt during the Twelfth Dynasty (1991–1802 BC).[15] The screw, the last of the simple machines to be invented,[16] first appeared in Mesopotamia during the Neo-Assyrian period (911–609) BC.[14] The Egyptian pyramids were built using three of the six simple machines, the inclined plane, the wedge, and the lever, to create structures like the Great Pyramid of Giza.[17]\nThe earliest civil engineer known by name is Imhotep.[6] As one of the officials of the Pharaoh, Djosèr, he probably designed and supervised the construction of the Pyramid of Djoser (the Step Pyramid) at Saqqara in Egypt around 2630–2611 BC.[18] The earliest practical water-powered machines, the water wheel and watermill, first appeared in the Persian Empire, in what are now Iraq and Iran, by the early 4th century BC.[19]\nKush developed the Sakia during the 4th century BC, which relied on animal power instead of human energy.[20] Hafirs were developed as a type of reservoir in Kush to store and contain water as well as boost irrigation.[21] Sappers were employed to build causeways during military campaigns.[22] Kushite ancestors built speos during the Bronze Age between 3700 and 3250 BC.[23] Bloomeries and blast furnaces were also created during the 7th centuries BC in Kush.[24][25][26][27]\nAncient Greece developed machines in both civilian and military domains. The Antikythera mechanism, an early known mechanical analog computer,[28][29] and the mechanical inventions of Archimedes, are examples of Greek mechanical engineering. Some of Archimedes' inventions, as well as the Antikythera mechanism, required sophisticated knowledge of differential gearing or epicyclic gearing, two key principles in machine theory that helped design the gear trains of the Industrial Revolution, and are widely used in fields such as robotics and automotive engineering.[30]\nAncient Chinese, Greek, Roman and Hunnic armies employed military machines and inventions such as artillery which was developed by the Greeks around the 4th century BC,[31] the trireme, the ballista and the catapult, the trebuchet by Chinese circa 6th-5th century BCE.[32]\nMiddle Ages\nThe earliest practical wind-powered machines, the windmill and wind pump, first appeared in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age, in what are now Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, by the 9th century AD.[33][34][35][36] The earliest practical steam-powered machine was a steam jack driven by a steam turbine, described in 1551 by Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf in Ottoman Egypt.[37][38]\nThe cotton gin was invented in India by the 6th century AD,[39] and the spinning wheel was invented in the Islamic world by the early 11th century,[40] both of which were fundamental to the growth of the cotton industry. The spinning wheel was also a precursor to the spinning jenny, which was a key development during the early Industrial Revolution in the 18th century.[41]\nThe earliest programmable machines were developed in the Muslim world. A music sequencer, a programmable musical instrument, was the earliest type of programmable machine. The first music sequencer was an automated flute player invented by the Banu Musa brothers, described in their Book of Ingenious Devices, in the 9th century.[42][43] In 1206, Al-Jazari invented programmable automata/robots. He described four automaton musicians, including drummers operated by a programmable drum machine, where they could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns.[44]\nBefore the development of modern engineering, mathematics was used by artisans and craftsmen, such as millwrights, clockmakers, instrument makers and surveyors. Aside from these professions, universities were not believed to have had much practical significance to technology.[45]: 32\nA standard reference for the state of mechanical arts during the Renaissance is given in the mining engineering treatise De re metallica (1556), which also contains sections on geology, mining, and chemistry. De re metallica was the standard chemistry reference for the next 180 years.[45]\nModern era\nThe science of classical mechanics, sometimes called Newtonian mechanics, formed the scientific basis of much of modern engineering.[45] With the rise of engineering as a profession in the 18th century, the term became more narrowly applied to fields in which mathematics and science were applied to these ends. Similarly, in addition to military and civil engineering, the fields then known as the mechanic arts became incorporated into engineering.\nCanal building was an important engineering work during the early phases of the Industrial Revolution.[46]\nJohn Smeaton was the first self-proclaimed civil engineer and is often regarded as the \"father\" of civil engineering. He was an English civil engineer responsible for the design of bridges, canals, harbors, and lighthouses. He was also a capable mechanical engineer and an eminent physicist. Using a model water wheel, Smeaton conducted experiments for seven years, determining ways to increase efficiency.[47]: 127 Smeaton introduced iron axles and gears to water wheels.[45]: 69 Smeaton also made mechanical improvements to the Newcomen steam engine. Smeaton designed the third Eddystone Lighthouse (1755–59) where he pioneered the use of 'hydraulic lime' (a form of mortar which will set under water) and developed a technique involving dovetailed blocks of granite in the building of the lighthouse. He is important in the history, rediscovery of, and development of modern cement, because he identified the compositional requirements needed to obtain \"hydraulicity\" in lime; work which led ultimately to the invention of Portland cement.\nApplied science led to the development of the steam engine. The sequence of events began with the invention of the barometer and the measurement of atmospheric pressure by Evangelista Torricelli in 1643, demonstration of the force of atmospheric pressure by Otto von Guericke using the Magdeburg hemispheres in 1656, laboratory experiments by Denis Papin, who built experimental model steam engines and demonstrated the use of a piston, which he published in 1707. Edward Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Worcester published a book of 100 inventions containing a method for raising waters similar to a coffee percolator. Samuel Morland, a mathematician and inventor who worked on pumps, left notes at the Vauxhall Ordinance Office on a steam pump design that Thomas Savery read. In 1698 Savery built a steam pump called \"The Miner's Friend\". It employed both vacuum and pressure.[48] Iron merchant Thomas Newcomen, who built the first commercial piston steam engine in 1712, was not known to have any scientific training.[47]: 32\nThe application of steam-powered cast iron blowing cylinders for providing pressurized air for blast furnaces lead to a large increase in iron production in the late 18th century. The higher furnace temperatures made possible with steam-powered blast allowed for the use of more lime in blast furnaces, which enabled the transition from charcoal to coke.[49] These innovations lowered the cost of iron, making horse railways and iron bridges practical. The puddling process, patented by Henry Cort in 1784 produced large scale quantities of wrought iron. Hot blast, patented by James Beaumont Neilson in 1828, greatly lowered the amount of fuel needed to smelt iron. With the development of the high pressure steam engine, the power to weight ratio of steam engines made practical steamboats and locomotives possible.[50] New steel making processes, such as the Bessemer process and the open hearth furnace, ushered in an area of heavy engineering in the late 19th century.\nOne of the most famous engineers of the mid-19th century was Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who built railroads, dockyards and steamships.\nThe Industrial Revolution created a demand for machinery with metal parts, which led to the development of several machine tools. Boring cast iron cylinders with precision was not possible until John Wilkinson invented his boring machine, which is considered the first machine tool.[51] Other machine tools included the screw cutting lathe, milling machine, turret lathe and the metal planer. Precision machining techniques were developed in the first half of the 19th century. These included the use of gigs to guide the machining tool over the work and fixtures to hold the work in the proper position. Machine tools and machining techniques capable of producing interchangeable parts lead to large scale factory production by the late 19th century.[52]\nThe United States Census of 1850 listed the occupation of \"engineer\" for the first time with a count of 2,000.[53] There were fewer than 50 engineering graduates in the U.S. before 1865. The first PhD in engineering (technically, applied science and engineering) awarded in the United States went to Josiah Willard Gibbs at Yale University in 1863; it was also the second PhD awarded in science in the U.S.[54] In 1870 there were a dozen U.S. mechanical engineering graduates, with that number increasing to 43 per year in 1875. In 1890, there were 6,000 engineers in civil, mining, mechanical and electrical.[50] There was no chair of applied mechanism and applied mechanics at Cambridge until 1875, and no chair of engineering at Oxford until 1907. Germany established technical universities earlier.[55]\nThe foundations of electrical engineering in the 1800s included the experiments of Alessandro Volta, Michael Faraday, Georg Ohm and others and the invention of the electric telegraph in 1816 and the electric motor in 1872. The theoretical work of James Maxwell (see: Maxwell's equations) and Heinrich Hertz in the late 19th century gave rise to the field of electronics. The later inventions of the vacuum tube and the transistor further accelerated the development of electronics to such an extent that electrical and electronics engineers currently outnumber their colleagues of any other engineering specialty.[6] Chemical engineering developed in the late nineteenth century.[6] Industrial scale manufacturing demanded new materials and new processes and by 1880 the need for large scale production of chemicals was such that a new industry was created, dedicated to the development and large scale manufacturing of chemicals in new industrial plants.[6] The role of the chemical engineer was the design of these chemical plants and processes.[6] Originally deriving from the manufacture of ceramics and its putative derivative metallurgy, materials science is one of the oldest forms of engineering.[56] Modern materials science evolved directly from metallurgy, which itself evolved from the use of fire. Important elements of modern materials science were products of the Space Race; the understanding and engineering of the metallic alloys, and silica and carbon materials, used in building space vehicles enabling the exploration of space. Materials science has driven, and been driven by, the development of revolutionary technologies such as rubbers, plastics, semiconductors, and biomaterials.\nAeronautical engineering deals with aircraft design process design while aerospace engineering is a more modern term that expands the reach of the discipline by including spacecraft design. Its origins can be traced back to the aviation pioneers around the start of the 20th century although the work of Sir George Cayley has recently been dated as being from the last decade of the 18th century. Early knowledge of aeronautical engineering was largely empirical with some concepts and skills imported from other branches of engineering.[57] Only a decade after the successful flights by the Wright brothers, there was extensive development of aeronautical engineering through development of military aircraft that were used in World War I. Meanwhile, research to provide fundamental background science continued by combining theoretical physics with experiments.\nBranches of engineering\nEngineering is a broad discipline that is often broken down into several sub-disciplines. Although most engineers will usually be trained in a specific discipline, some engineers become multi-disciplined through experience. Engineering is often characterized as having five main branches:[58][59][60] chemical engineering, civil engineering, electrical engineering, materials science and engineering, and mechanical engineering.\nBelow is a list of recognized branches of engineering. There are additional sub-disciplines as well.\nInterdisciplinary engineering\nInterdisciplinary engineering draws from more than one of the principle branches of the practice. Historically, naval engineering and mining engineering were major branches. Other engineering fields are manufacturing engineering, acoustical engineering, corrosion engineering, instrumentation and control, automotive, information engineering, petroleum, systems, audio, software, architectural, biosystems, and textile engineering.[61] These and other branches of engineering are represented in the 36 licensed member institutions of the UK Engineering Council.\nNew specialties sometimes combine with the traditional fields and form new branches – for example, Earth systems engineering and management involves a wide range of subject areas including engineering studies, environmental science, engineering ethics and philosophy of engineering.\nPractice\nOne who practices engineering is called an engineer, and those licensed to do so may have more formal designations such as Professional Engineer, Chartered Engineer, Incorporated Engineer, Ingenieur, European Engineer, or Designated Engineering Representative.\nMethodology\nIn the engineering design process, engineers apply mathematics and sciences such as physics to find novel solutions to problems or to improve existing solutions. Engineers need proficient knowledge of relevant sciences for their design projects. As a result, many engineers continue to learn new material throughout their careers.\nIf multiple solutions exist, engineers weigh each design choice based on their merit and choose the solution that best matches the requirements. The task of the engineer is to identify, understand, and interpret the constraints on a design in order to yield a successful result. It is generally insufficient to build a technically successful product, rather, it must also meet further requirements.\nConstraints may include available resources, physical, imaginative or technical limitations, flexibility for future modifications and additions, and other factors, such as requirements for cost, safety, marketability, productivity, and serviceability. By understanding the constraints, engineers derive specifications for the limits within which a viable object or system may be produced and operated.\nProblem solving\nEngineers use their knowledge of science, mathematics, logic, economics, and appropriate experience or tacit knowledge to find suitable solutions to a particular problem. Creating an appropriate mathematical model of a problem often allows them to analyze it (sometimes definitively), and to test potential solutions.[62]\nMore than one solution to a design problem usually exists so the different design choices have to be evaluated on their merits before the one judged most suitable is chosen. Genrich Altshuller, after gathering statistics on a large number of patents, suggested that compromises are at the heart of \"low-level\" engineering designs, while at a higher level the best design is one which eliminates the core contradiction causing the problem.[63]\nEngineers typically attempt to predict how well their designs will perform to their specifications prior to full-scale production. They use, among other things: prototypes, scale models, simulations, destructive tests, nondestructive tests, and stress tests. Testing ensures that products will perform as expected but only in so far as the testing has been representative of use in service. For products, such as aircraft, that are used differently by different users failures and unexpected shortcomings (and necessary design changes) can be expected throughout the operational life of the product.[64]\nEngineers take on the responsibility of producing designs that will perform as well as expected and, except those employed in specific areas of the arms industry, will not harm people. Engineers typically include a factor of safety in their designs to reduce the risk of unexpected failure.\nThe study of failed products is known as forensic engineering. It attempts to identify the cause of failure to allow a redesign of the product and so prevent a re-occurrence. Careful analysis is needed to establish the cause of failure of a product. The consequences of a failure may vary in severity from the minor cost of a machine breakdown to large loss of life in the case of accidents involving aircraft and large stationary structures like buildings and dams.[65]\nComputer use\nAs with all modern scientific and technological endeavors, computers and software play an increasingly important role. As well as the typical business application software there are a number of computer aided applications (computer-aided technologies) specifically for engineering. Computers can be used to generate models of fundamental physical processes, which can be solved using numerical methods.\nOne of the most widely used design tools in the profession is computer-aided design (CAD) software. It enables engineers to create 3D models, 2D drawings, and schematics of their designs. CAD together with digital mockup (DMU) and CAE software such as finite element method analysis or analytic element method allows engineers to create models of designs that can be analyzed without having to make expensive and time-consuming physical prototypes.\nThese allow products and components to be checked for flaws; assess fit and assembly; study ergonomics; and to analyze static and dynamic characteristics of systems such as stresses, temperatures, electromagnetic emissions, electrical currents and voltages, digital logic levels, fluid flows, and kinematics. Access and distribution of all this information is generally organized with the use of product data management software.[66]\nThere are also many tools to support specific engineering tasks such as computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software to generate CNC machining instructions; manufacturing process management software for production engineering; EDA for printed circuit board (PCB) and circuit schematics for electronic engineers; MRO applications for maintenance management; and Architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) software for civil engineering.\nIn recent years the use of computer software to aid the development of goods has collectively come to be known as product lifecycle management (PLM).[67]\nSocial context\nThe engineering profession engages in a range of activities, from collaboration at the societal level, and smaller individual projects. Almost all engineering projects are obligated to a funding source: a company, a set of investors, or a government. The types of engineering that are less constrained by such a funding source, are pro bono, and open-design engineering.\nEngineering has interconnections with society, culture and human behavior. Most products and constructions used by modern society, are influenced by engineering. Engineering activities have an impact on the environment, society, economies, and public safety.\nEngineering projects can be controversial. Examples from different engineering disciplines include: the development of nuclear weapons, the Three Gorges Dam, the design and use of sport utility vehicles and the extraction of oil. In response, some engineering companies have enacted serious corporate and social responsibility policies.\nThe attainment of many of the Millennium Development Goals requires the achievement of sufficient engineering capacity to develop infrastructure and sustainable technological development.[68]\nOverseas development and relief NGOs make considerable use of engineers, to apply solutions in disaster and development scenarios. Some charitable organizations use engineering directly for development:\n- Engineers Without Borders\n- Engineers Against Poverty\n- Registered Engineers for Disaster Relief\n- Engineers for a Sustainable World\n- Engineering for Change\n- Engineering Ministries International[69]\nEngineering companies in more developed economies face challenges with regard to the number of engineers being trained, compared with those retiring. This problem is prominent in the UK where engineering has a poor image and low status.[70] There are negative economic and political issues that this can cause, as well as ethical issues.[71] It is agreed the engineering profession faces an \"image crisis\".[72] The UK holds the most engineering companies compared to other European countries, together with the United States.[citation needed]\nCode of ethics\nMany engineering societies have established codes of practice and codes of ethics to guide members and inform the public at large. The National Society of Professional Engineers code of ethics states:\nEngineering is an important and learned profession. As members of this profession, engineers are expected to exhibit the highest standards of honesty and integrity. Engineering has a direct and vital impact on the quality of life for all people. Accordingly, the services provided by engineers require honesty, impartiality, fairness, and equity, and must be dedicated to the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare. Engineers must perform under a standard of professional behavior that requires adherence to the highest principles of ethical conduct.[73]\nIn Canada, engineers wear the Iron Ring as a symbol and reminder of the obligations and ethics associated with their profession.[74]\nRelationships with other disciplines\nScience\nScientists study the world as it is; engineers create the world that has never been.\nThere exists an overlap between the sciences and engineering practice; in engineering, one applies science. Both areas of endeavor rely on accurate observation of materials and phenomena. Both use mathematics and classification criteria to analyze and communicate observations.[citation needed]\nScientists may also have to complete engineering tasks, such as designing experimental apparatus or building prototypes. Conversely, in the process of developing technology, engineers sometimes find themselves exploring new phenomena, thus becoming, for the moment, scientists or more precisely \"engineering scientists\".[78]\nIn the book What Engineers Know and How They Know It,[79] Walter Vincenti asserts that engineering research has a character different from that of scientific research. First, it often deals with areas in which the basic physics or chemistry are well understood, but the problems themselves are too complex to solve in an exact manner.\nThere is a \"real and important\" difference between engineering and physics as similar to any science field has to do with technology.[80][81] Physics is an exploratory science that seeks knowledge of principles while engineering uses knowledge for practical applications of principles. The former equates an understanding into a mathematical principle while the latter measures variables involved and creates technology.[82][83][84] For technology, physics is an auxiliary and in a way technology is considered as applied physics.[85] Though physics and engineering are interrelated, it does not mean that a physicist is trained to do an engineer's job. A physicist would typically require additional and relevant training.[86] Physicists and engineers engage in different lines of work.[87] But PhD physicists who specialize in sectors of engineering physics and applied physics are titled as Technology officer, R&D Engineers and System Engineers.[88]\nAn example of this is the use of numerical approximations to the Navier–Stokes equations to describe aerodynamic flow over an aircraft, or the use of the finite element method to calculate the stresses in complex components. Second, engineering research employs many semi-empirical methods that are foreign to pure scientific research, one example being the method of parameter variation.[89]\nAs stated by Fung et al. in the revision to the classic engineering text Foundations of Solid Mechanics:\nEngineering is quite different from science. Scientists try to understand nature. Engineers try to make things that do not exist in nature. Engineers stress innovation and invention. To embody an invention the engineer must put his idea in concrete terms, and design something that people can use. That something can be a complex system, device, a gadget, a material, a method, a computing program, an innovative experiment, a new solution to a problem, or an improvement on what already exists. Since a design has to be realistic and functional, it must have its geometry, dimensions, and characteristics data defined. In the past engineers working on new designs found that they did not have all the required information to make design decisions. Most often, they were limited by insufficient scientific knowledge. Thus they studied mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and mechanics. Often they had to add to the sciences relevant to their profession. Thus engineering sciences were born.[90]\nAlthough engineering solutions make use of scientific principles, engineers must also take into account safety, efficiency, economy, reliability, and constructability or ease of fabrication as well as the environment, ethical and legal considerations such as patent infringement or liability in the case of failure of the solution.[91]\nMedicine and biology\nThe study of the human body, albeit from different directions and for different purposes, is an important common link between medicine and some engineering disciplines. Medicine aims to sustain, repair, enhance and even replace functions of the human body, if necessary, through the use of technology.\nModern medicine can replace several of the body's functions through the use of artificial organs and can significantly alter the function of the human body through artificial devices such as, for example, brain implants and pacemakers.[92][93] The fields of bionics and medical bionics are dedicated to the study of synthetic implants pertaining to natural systems.\nConversely, some engineering disciplines view the human body as a biological machine worth studying and are dedicated to emulating many of its functions by replacing biology with technology. This has led to fields such as artificial intelligence, neural networks, fuzzy logic, and robotics. There are also substantial interdisciplinary interactions between engineering and medicine.[94][95]\nBoth fields provide solutions to real world problems. This often requires moving forward before phenomena are completely understood in a more rigorous scientific sense and therefore experimentation and empirical knowledge is an integral part of both.\nMedicine, in part, studies the function of the human body. The human body, as a biological machine, has many functions that can be modeled using engineering methods.[96]\nThe heart for example functions much like a pump,[97] the skeleton is like a linked structure with levers,[98] the brain produces electrical signals etc.[99] These similarities as well as the increasing importance and application of engineering principles in medicine, led to the development of the field of biomedical engineering that uses concepts developed in both disciplines.\nNewly emerging branches of science, such as systems biology, are adapting analytical tools traditionally used for engineering, such as systems modeling and computational analysis, to the description of biological systems.[96]\nArt\nThere are connections between engineering and art, for example, architecture, landscape architecture and industrial design (even to the extent that these disciplines may sometimes be included in a university's Faculty of Engineering).[101][102][103]\nThe Art Institute of Chicago, for instance, held an exhibition about the art of NASA's aerospace design.[104] Robert Maillart's bridge design is perceived by some to have been deliberately artistic.[105] At the University of South Florida, an engineering professor, through a grant with the National Science Foundation, has developed a course that connects art and engineering.[101][106]\nAmong famous historical figures, Leonardo da Vinci is a well-known Renaissance artist and engineer, and a prime example of the nexus between art and engineering.[100][107]\nBusiness\nBusiness engineering deals with the relationship between professional engineering, IT systems, business administration and change management. Engineering management or \"Management engineering\" is a specialized field of management concerned with engineering practice or the engineering industry sector. The demand for management-focused engineers (or from the opposite perspective, managers with an understanding of engineering), has resulted in the development of specialized engineering management degrees that develop the knowledge and skills needed for these roles. During an engineering management course, students will develop industrial engineering skills, knowledge, and expertise, alongside knowledge of business administration, management techniques, and strategic thinking. Engineers specializing in change management must have in-depth knowledge of the application of industrial and organizational psychology principles and methods. Professional engineers often train as certified management consultants in the very specialized field of management consulting applied to engineering practice or the engineering sector. This work often deals with large scale complex business transformation or business process management initiatives in aerospace and defence, automotive, oil and gas, machinery, pharmaceutical, food and beverage, electrical and electronics, power distribution and generation, utilities and transportation systems. This combination of technical engineering practice, management consulting practice, industry sector knowledge, and change management expertise enables professional engineers who are also qualified as management consultants to lead major business transformation initiatives. These initiatives are typically sponsored by C-level executives.\nOther fields\nIn political science, the term engineering has been borrowed for the study of the subjects of social engineering and political engineering, which deal with forming political and social structures using engineering methodology coupled with political science principles. Marketing engineering and financial engineering have similarly borrowed the term.\nSee also\n- Lists\n- List of aerospace engineering topics\n- List of basic chemical engineering topics\n- List of electrical engineering topics\n- List of engineering societies\n- List of engineering topics\n- List of engineers\n- List of genetic engineering topics\n- List of mechanical engineering topics\n- List of nanoengineering topics\n- List of software engineering topics\n- Glossaries\n- Related subjects\n- Controversies over the term Engineer\n- Design\n- Earthquake engineering\n- Engineer\n- Engineering economics\n- Engineering education\n- Engineering education research\n- Environmental engineering science\n- Global Engineering Education\n- Green engineering\n- Reverse engineering\n- Structural failure\n- Sustainable engineering\n- Women in engineering\nReferences\n- ^ Hammack, William; Anderson, John (February 16, 2022). \"Working in the Penumbra of Understanding\".

The scientific method has a prescribed process: state a question, observe, state a hypothesis, test, analyze, and interpret. It doesn't know what will be discovered, what truth will be revealed. In contrast, the engineering method aims for a specific goal and cannot be reduced to a set of fixed steps that must be followed.\n- ^ definition of \"engineering\" from the https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/ Archived February 16, 2021, at the Wayback Machine Cambridge Academic Content Dictionary © Cambridge University\n- ^ \"About IAENG\". iaeng.org.

          "content": "Engineering\nEngineering is the use of science and math to design or make things. People who do engineering are called engineers. They learn engineering at a college or university. Engineers usually design or build things. Some engineers also use science, mathematics, and other skills to solve problems in technology. There are different types of engineers that design everything from computers and buildings to watches and websites. People have been creating and engineering things for thousands of years. Some become engineering managers.\nSpecialties\n[change | change source]Engineering is a big subject. Here are a few of the many types of engineers:\n- Aerospace engineers design space vehicles or airplanes.\n- Biomedical engineers design and work with medical equipment.\n- Ceramic engineers create objects from inorganic, non-metallic materials.\n- Chemical engineers use chemicals to make products like drugs and medicines or fertilizers for crops.\n- Civil engineers work on roads, bridges, buildings and other public structures.\n- Computer engineers design or improve computers (including embedded systems and their parts).\n- Electrical engineers work with electricity and design electrical equipment, from small things like radios and computers to large things like electric power transmission systems.\n- Electronic engineers work with electronics, which are used to build computer parts and electrical equipment.\n- Environmental engineers design and implement ways to remediate and restore the environment.\n- Manufacturing engineers design and improve the machines and assembly lines that make things. They work with robots and automation and ways to help companies work faster and better with fewer mistakes.\n- Mechanical engineers design machines or things that move, like cars and trains. A mechanical engineer also might help design electricity generating stations, oil refineries, and factories.\n- Mechatronics engineers work in multiple fields of engineering that include mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, telecommunications engineering, control engineering and computer engineering.\n- Marine engineers design, build, test and repair boats, ships, underwater craft, focusing primarily on their internal systems.\n- Nanotechnology engineers study very small things, like strings of atoms and how they are put together.\n- Nuclear engineers design and build nuclear plants. They also study the characteristic behaviors of certain radioactive or unstable elements.\n- Structural engineers work on design and analysis of buildings and other large structures to withstand both the gravity and wind loads as well as natural disasters.\n- Software engineers design and write programs for computers.\n- Systems engineers look at how complicated things work and try to make them faster and smarter.\nEngineers do not only work with machines. They also work a lot with other people.[1] Many engineering projects are large and very complicated. Often different kinds of engineers work together and help each other. As an example, computer engineers need help from electrical engineers to build a computer. The computer needs programs written by software engineers. The computer could be used by aerospace engineers to control an airplane. An airplane is a big mechanical system with many parts, so a mechanical engineer and a systems engineer are also needed.\nStudy\n[change | change source]Most (but not all) engineers have had years of training. Much of their training involves learning to work within limited budgetary and material constraints (limits).\nAmerican courses\n[change | change source]In the United States, most engineers go to a college or university to get an engineering degree. Most people go to school for four years to get a bachelor's degree in engineering. A Master's Degree is an advanced degree, usually requiring two more years of study after the Bachelors. A person with a master's degree is eligible to enter a Doctoral program in engineering. A graduate of a Doctoral program is awarded a Doctor of Philosophy degree, which is commonly called a PhD. A PhD in engineering requires three or four years of study after a master's degree, and includes the completion of a long research report called a dissertation. After having gained enough work experience, one can sit for their Professional Engineer's (PE) License, reinforcing their demonstrated proficiency in their specialty.\nBritish courses\n[change | change source]In the United Kingdom, engineering degrees at universities are either three year BEng (Bachelor of Engineering) or four year MEng (Master of Engineering). In many universities it is common to take only one engineering discipline (e.g. aeronautical or civil engineering) although some universities have a general engineering degree. British universities may also offer Doctoral programs as a doctor of philosophy (PhD) or a doctor of engineering (EngD). Engineers of all disciplines have common approaches to solving problems including teamwork, communication, and an Iterative design process.\nEngineers can also get additional recognition in the form of becoming Chartered. A chartered engineer is one who has his degree or doctorate has been recognised by a group of professionals such as the IET (Institute of Engineering and Technology), IMechE (Institution of Mechanical Engineers), IChemE (Institution of Chemical Engineers) or ICE (Institution of Civil Engineers). Experience and responsibility enables a further step of recognition by becoming a Fellow of these institutions.\nFrench courses\n[change | change source]The best way to become an engineer in France is to take the CPGE (Classe Préparatoire pour les Grandes Écoles is the French class for engineer's school) for two years and then study for three years in an \"École d'Ingénieur\" (Engineer's school). You can also study in an IUT (Institut universitaire technologique) for two years, and then study three years in an \"École d'Ingénieur\".\nNotes\n[change | change source]- ↑ \"Principles of Ethical conduct in Engineering Practice Under The North American Free Trade Agreement\".

          "content": "Engineer\nEngineers, as practitioners of engineering, are professionals who invent, design, analyze, build and test machines, complex systems, structures, gadgets and materials to fulfill functional objectives and requirements while considering the limitations imposed by practicality, regulation, safety and cost.[1][2] The word engineer (Latin ingeniator,[3] the origin of the Ir. in the title of engineer in countries like Belgium, The Netherlands, and Indonesia) is derived from the Latin words ingeniare (\"to contrive, devise\") and ingenium (\"cleverness\").[4][5] The foundational qualifications of a licensed professional engineer typically include a four-year bachelor's degree in an engineering discipline, or in some jurisdictions, a master's degree in an engineering discipline plus four to six years of peer-reviewed professional practice (culminating in a project report or thesis) and passage of engineering board examinations.\nThe work of engineers forms the link between scientific discoveries and their subsequent applications to human and business needs and quality of life.[1]\nDefinition\n[edit]In 1961, the Conference of Engineering Societies of Western Europe and the United States of America defined \"professional engineer\" as follows:[6]\nA professional engineer is competent by virtue of his/her fundamental education and training to apply the scientific method and outlook to the analysis and solution of engineering problems. He/she is able to assume personal responsibility for the development and application of engineering science and knowledge, notably in research, design, construction, manufacturing, superintending, managing, and in the education of the engineer. His/her work is predominantly intellectual and varied and not of a routine mental or physical character. It requires the exercise of original thought and judgment and the ability to supervise the technical and administrative work of others. His/her education will have been such as to make him/her capable of closely and continuously following progress in his/her branch of engineering science by consulting newly published works on a worldwide basis, assimilating such information, and applying it independently. He/she is thus placed in a position to make contributions to the development of engineering science or its applications. His/her education and training will have been such that he/she will have acquired a broad and general appreciation of the engineering sciences as well as thorough insight into the special features of his/her own branch. In due time he/she will be able to give authoritative technical advice and assume responsibility for the direction of important tasks in his/her branch.\nRoles and expertise\n[edit]Design\n[edit]Engineers develop new technological solutions. During the engineering design process, the responsibilities of the engineer may include defining problems, conducting and narrowing research, analyzing criteria, finding and analyzing solutions, and making decisions. Much of an engineer's time is spent on researching, locating, applying, and transferring information.[7] Indeed, research suggests engineers spend 56% of their time engaged in various information behaviours, including 14% actively searching for information.[8]\nEngineers must weigh different design choices on their merits and choose the solution that best matches the requirements and needs. Their crucial and unique task is to identify, understand, and interpret the constraints on a design in order to produce a successful result. Good problem solving skills are an important asset for engineers.\nAnalysis\n[edit]Engineers apply techniques of engineering analysis in testing, production, or maintenance. Analytical engineers may supervise production in factories and elsewhere, determine the causes of a process failure, and test output to maintain quality. They also estimate the time and cost required to complete projects. Supervisory engineers are responsible for major components or entire projects. Engineering analysis involves the application of scientific analytic principles and processes to reveal the properties and state of the system, device or mechanism under study. Engineering analysis proceeds by separating the engineering design into the mechanisms of operation or failure, analyzing or estimating each component of the operation or failure mechanism in isolation, and recombining the components. They may analyze risk.[9][10][11][12]\nMany engineers use computers to produce and analyze designs, to simulate and test how a machine, structure, or system operates, to generate specifications for parts, to monitor the quality of products, and to control the efficiency of processes.\nSpecialization and management\n[edit]Most engineers specialize in one or more engineering disciplines.[1] Numerous specialties are recognized by professional societies, and each of the major branches of engineering has numerous subdivisions. Civil engineering, for example, includes structural engineering, along with transportation engineering, geotechnical engineering, and materials engineering, including ceramic, metallurgical, and polymer engineering. Mechanical engineering cuts across most disciplines since its core essence is applied physics. Engineers also may specialize in one industry, such as motor vehicles, or in one type of technology, such as turbines or semiconductor materials.[1]\nSeveral recent studies have investigated how engineers spend their time; that is, the work tasks they perform and how their time is distributed among these. Research[8][13] suggests that there are several key themes present in engineers' work: technical work (i.e., the application of science to product development), social work (i.e., interactive communication between people), computer-based work and information behaviors. Among other more detailed findings, a 2012 work sampling study[13] found that engineers spend 62.92% of their time engaged in technical work, 40.37% in social work, and 49.66% in computer-based work. Furthermore, there was considerable overlap between these different types of work, with engineers spending 24.96% of their time engaged in technical and social work, 37.97% in technical and non-social, 15.42% in non-technical and social, and 21.66% in non-technical and non-social.\nEngineering is also an information-intensive field, with research finding that engineers spend 55.8% of their time engaged in various different information behaviors, including 14.2% actively seeking information from other people (7.8%) and information repositories such as documents and databases (6.4%).[8]\nThe time engineers spend engaged in such activities is also reflected in the competencies required in engineering roles. In addition to engineers' core technical competence, research has also demonstrated the critical nature of their personal attributes, project management skills, and cognitive abilities to success in the role.[14]\nTypes of engineers\n[edit]There are many branches of engineering, each of which specializes in specific technologies and products. Typically, engineers will have deep knowledge in one area and basic knowledge in related areas. For example, mechanical engineering curricula typically include introductory courses in electrical engineering, computer science, materials science, metallurgy, mathematics, and software engineering.\nAn engineer may either be hired for a firm that requires engineers on a continuous basis, or may belong to an engineering firm that provides engineering consulting services to other firms.\nWhen developing a product, engineers typically work in interdisciplinary teams. For example, when building robots an engineering team will typically have at least three types of engineers. A mechanical engineer would design the body and actuators. An electrical engineer would design the power systems, sensors, electronics, embedded software in electronics, and control circuitry. Finally, a software engineer would develop the software that makes the robot behave properly. Engineers that aspire to management engage in further study in business administration, project management and organizational or business psychology. Often engineers move up the management hierarchy from managing projects, functional departments, and divisions, and some eventually become CEOs of multi-national corporations.\nEthics\n[edit]Engineers have obligations to the public, their clients, employers, and the profession. Many engineering societies have established codes of practice and codes of ethics to guide members and inform the public at large. Each engineering discipline and professional society maintains a code of ethics, which the members pledge to uphold. Depending on their specializations, engineers may also be governed by specific statute, whistleblowing, product liability laws, and often the principles of business ethics.[15][16][17]\nSome graduates of engineering programs in North America may be recognized by the iron ring or Engineer's Ring, a ring made of iron or stainless steel that is worn on the little finger of the dominant hand. This tradition began in 1925 in Canada with The Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer, where the ring serves as a symbol and reminder of the engineer's obligations to the engineering profession. In 1972, the practice was adopted by several colleges in the United States including members of the Order of the Engineer.\nEducation\n[edit]Most engineering programs involve a concentration of study in an engineering specialty, along with courses in both mathematics and the physical and life sciences. Many programs also include courses in general engineering and applied accounting. A design course, often accompanied by a computer or laboratory class or both, is part of the curriculum of most programs. Often, general courses not directly related to engineering, such as those in the social sciences or humanities, also are required.\nAccreditation is the process by which engineering programs are evaluated by an external body to determine if applicable standards are met. The Washington Accord serves as an international accreditation agreement for academic engineering degrees, recognizing the substantial equivalency in the standards set by many major national engineering bodies. In the United States, post-secondary degree programs in engineering are accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology.\nRegulation\n[edit]In many countries, engineering tasks such as the design of bridges, electric power plants, industrial equipment, machine design and chemical plants, must be approved by a licensed professional engineer. Most commonly titled professional engineer is a license to practice and is indicated with the use of post-nominal letters; PE or P.Eng. These are common in North America, as is European engineer (EUR ING) in Europe.[citation needed]\nIn the United States, engineering is a regulated profession whose practice and practitioners are licensed and governed by law. Licensure is generally attainable through combination of education, pre-examination (Fundamentals of Engineering exam), examination (professional engineering exam),[18] and engineering experience (typically in the area of 5+ years). Each state tests and licenses professional engineers. Currently, most states do not license by specific engineering discipline, but rather provide generalized licensure, and trust engineers to use professional judgment regarding their individual competencies; this is the favoured approach of the professional societies. Despite this, at least one of the examinations required by most states is actually focused on a particular discipline; candidates for licensure typically choose the category of examination which comes closest to their respective expertise. In the United States, an \"industrial exemption\" allows businesses to employ employees and call them an \"engineer\", as long as such individuals are under the direct supervision and control of the business entity and function internally related to manufacturing (manufactured parts) related to the business entity, or work internally within an exempt organization. Such person does not have the final authority to approve, or the ultimate responsibility for, engineering designs, plans, or specifications that are to be incorporated into fixed works, systems, or facilities on the property of others or made available to the public. These individuals are prohibited from offering engineering services directly to the public or other businesses, or engage in practice of engineering unless the business entity is registered with the state's board of engineering, and the practice is carried on or supervised directly only by engineers licensed to engage in the practice of engineering.[19] In some instances, some positions, such as a \"sanitation engineer\", does not have any basis in engineering sciences. Although some states require a BS degree in engineering accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC) of Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) with no exceptions, about two thirds of the states accept BS degrees in engineering technology accredited by the Engineering Technology Accreditation Commission (ETAC) of ABET to become licensed as professional engineers. Each state has different requirements on years of experience to take the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) and Professional Engineering (PE) exams. A few states require a graduate MS in engineering to sit for the exams as further learning. After seven years of working after graduation, two years of responsibility for significant engineering work, continuous professional development, some highly qualified PEs are able to become International Professional Engineers Int(PE). These engineers must meet the highest level of professional competencies and this is a peer-reviewed process. Once the IntPE title is awarded, the engineer can gain easier admission to national registers of a number of members jurisdictions for international practice.[20]\nIn Canada, engineering is a self-regulated profession. The profession in each province is governed by its own engineering association. For instance, in the province of British Columbia an engineering graduate with four or more years of post graduate experience in an engineering-related field and passing exams in ethics and law will need to be registered by the Association for Professional Engineers and Geoscientists (APEGBC)[21] in order to become a Professional Engineer and be granted the professional designation of P.Eng allowing one to practice engineering.\nIn Continental Europe, Latin America, Turkey, and elsewhere the title is limited by law to people with an engineering degree and the use of the title by others is illegal. In Italy, the title is limited to people who hold an engineering degree, have passed a professional qualification examination (Esame di Stato) and are enrolled in the register of the local branch of National Associations of Engineers (a public body). In Portugal, professional engineer titles and accredited engineering degrees are regulated and certified by the Ordem dos Engenheiros. In the Czech Republic, the title \"engineer\" (Ing.) is given to people with a (master's) degree in chemistry, technology or economics for historical and traditional reasons. In Greece, the academic title of \"Diploma Engineer\" is awarded after completion of the five-year engineering study course and the title of \"Certified Engineer\" is awarded after completion of the four-year course of engineering studies at a Technological Educational Institute (TEI).\nDefinition by country\n[edit]The definition of the term \"engineer\" varies across countries and continents.\nAsia and Africa\n[edit]In the Indian subcontinent, Russia, Middle East, Africa, and China, engineering is one of the most sought-after undergraduate courses, for which entrance examinations are highly competitive.\nIn Egypt, the educational system makes engineering the second-most respected profession in the country (after medicine); engineering colleges at Egyptian universities require extremely high marks on the General Certificate of Secondary Education (Arabic: الثانوية العامة al-Thānawiyyah al-`Āmmah) – in the order of 97 or 98 per cent – and are thus considered (along with the colleges of medicine, natural science, and pharmacy) to be among the \"pinnacle colleges\" (كليات القمة kullīyāt al-qimmah).[citation needed]\nIn the Philippines and Filipino communities overseas, engineers who are either Filipino or not, especially those who also profess other jobs at the same time, are addressed and introduced as Engineer, rather than Sir/Madam in speech or Mr./Mrs./Ms. (G./Gng./Bb. in Filipino) before surnames. That word is used either in itself or before the given name or surname.\nEurope\n[edit]As of 2022[update], thirty two countries in Europe (including nearly all 27 countries of the EU) now recognise the title of \"European Engineer\" which permits the use of the pre-nominal title of \"EUR ING\" (always fully capitalised). Each country sets its own precise qualification requirement for the use of the title (though they are all broadly equivalent). Holding the requisite qualification does not afford automatic entitlement. The title has to be applied for (and the appropriate fee paid). The holder is entitled to use the title in their passport. EUR INGs are allowed to describe themselves as professionally qualified engineers and practise as such in any of the 32 participating countries including those where the title of engineer is regulated by law.[citation needed]\nFrance\n[edit]In France, the term ingénieur (engineer) is not a protected title and can be used by anyone who practices this profession.[22]\nHowever, the title ingénieur diplomé (graduate engineer) is an official academic title that is protected by the government and is associated with the Diplôme d'Ingénieur, which is a renowned academic degree in France. Anyone misusing this title in France can be fined a large sum and jailed, as it is usually reserved for graduates of French engineering grandes écoles. Engineering schools which were created during the French revolution have a special reputation among the French people, as they helped to make the transition from a mostly agricultural country of late 18th century to the industrially developed France of the 19th century. A great part of 19th-century France's economic wealth and industrial prowess was created by engineers that have graduated from École Centrale Paris, École des Mines de Paris, École polytechnique or Télécom Paris. This was also the case after WWII when France had to be rebuilt. Before the \"réforme René Haby\" in the 1970s, it was very difficult to be admitted to such schools, and the French ingénieurs were commonly perceived as the nation's élite. However, after the Haby reform and a series of further reforms (Modernization plans of French universities), several engineering schools were created which can be accessed with relatively lower competition.\nEngineering positions in France are now shared between the ingénieurs diplomés graduating from engineering grandes écoles and the holders of a master's degree in science from public universities.\nItaly\n[edit]In Italy, only people who hold a formal engineering qualification of at least a bachelor's degree are permitted to describe themselves as an engineer. So much so that people holding such qualifications are entitled to use the pre-nominal title of \"Ingegnere\" (or \"Ingegnera\" if female - in both cases often abbreviated to \"Ing.\") in lieu of \"Signore\", \"Signorina\" or \"Signora\" (Mr, Miss and Mrs respectively) in the same manner as someone holding a doctorate would use the pre-nominal title \"Doctor\".[23]\nUnited Kingdom\n[edit]In the UK, the practice of engineering is not a regulated profession but control of the titles of chartered engineer (CEng) and incorporated engineer (IEng) is regulated. These titles are protected by law and are subject to strict requirements defined by the Engineering Council. The title CEng is in use in nations of the Commonwealth of Nations that follow or adapt British professional codes.[citation needed]\nMany skilled and semi-skilled tradespeople in the UK, including, for example, engineering technicians who service domestic appliances or telephone systems, call themselves engineers, and the term in that context is commonly used by the public.[citation needed] Proposals such as a 2015 petition to the UK parliament[24] to legally protect the title \"engineer\" so that only professional engineers could use it have been unsuccessful (as of 2023[update])\nNorth America\n[edit]Canada\n[edit]In Canada, engineering is a regulated profession whose practice and practitioners are licensed and governed by law.[25] Licensed professional engineers are referred to as P.Eng. Many Canadian engineers wear an Iron Ring.[26]\nIn all Canadian provinces, the title \"Professional Engineer\" is protected by law and any non-licensed individual or company using the title is committing a legal offence and is subject to fines and restraining orders.[27] Contrary to insistence from the Professional Engineers Ontario (\"PEO\") and Engineers Canada, use of the title \"Engineer\" itself has been found by Canadian law to be acceptable by those not holding P.Eng. titles.[28][29]\nThe title of engineer is not exclusive to P.Eng titles. The title of Engineer is commonly held by \"Software Engineer\",[30] the Canadian Military as various ranks and positions,[31] railway locomotive engineers,[32] Stationary engineer and Aircraft Maintenance Engineers (AME), all of which do not commonly hold a P.Eng. designation.\nUnited States\n[edit]In the United States, the practice of professional engineering is highly regulated and the title \"professional engineer\" is legally protected, meaning that it is unlawful to use it to offer engineering services to the public unless permission, certification or other official endorsement is specifically granted by that state through a professional engineering license.[33]\nSpanish-speaking countries\n[edit]Certain Spanish-speaking countries follow the Italian convention of engineers using the pre-nominal title, in this case \"ingeniero\" (or \"ingeniera\" if female). Like in Italy, it is usually abbreviated to \"Ing.\" In Spain this practice is not followed.\nThe engineering profession enjoys high prestige in Spain, ranking close to medical doctors, scientists and professors, and above judges, journalists or entrepreneurs, according to a 2014 study.[34]\nSee also\n[edit]- Building engineer\n- Engineer's degree\n- Engineers Without Borders\n- European Engineer\n- Greatest Engineering Achievements\n- History of engineering\n- List of Bangladeshi engineers\n- List of engineering branches\n- List of engineers\n- List of fictional scientists and engineers\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ a b c d Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Manual Labor (2006). \"Engineers\".
