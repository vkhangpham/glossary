# Optimization Summary:

## Speed Improvements

1. **Increased Parallelism:**
   - Increased default concurrent requests from 5 to 10-20 (based on CPU count)
   - Added process pools for CPU-bound operations
   - Implemented batch processing for LLM API calls

2. **Memory Management:**
   - Added caching for LLM results to avoid redundant processing
   - More efficient processing of content extraction in batches
   - Proper cleanup of memory after batch processing

3. **Performance Options:**
   - Added skip-verification flag to bypass content verification when not needed
   - Option to disable batch LLM processing if causing issues
   - Configurable workers for multiprocessing
   - Optimized trafilatura processing moved to separate processes

4. **Reduced Network Overhead:**
   - Added persistent connection pools
   - Lowered rate limiting delays
   - Better error handling and recovery

## Usage Example

```bash
# Process with optimized defaults (faster)
python -m generate_glossary.web_miner_cli --input terms.txt --output results --max-concurrent 20 --process-batch-size 10

# Maximum speed (skips verification)
python -m generate_glossary.web_miner_cli --input terms.txt --output results --skip-verification --max-concurrent 30 --process-batch-size 15 --max-workers 8

# More reliable but slower
python -m generate_glossary.web_miner_cli --input terms.txt --output results --no-batch-llm --max-concurrent 10
```

These optimizations should significantly reduce processing time from ~1 day to several hours for large term lists.
