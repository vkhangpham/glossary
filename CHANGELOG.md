## [Unreleased]

## [2025-08-29] - Firecrawl SDK Migration

### Added
- **Firecrawl SDK integration** for web content mining (4x faster than previous approach)
- Structured data extraction with Pydantic schemas
- Built-in checkpointing and recovery system
- Automatic JavaScript rendering for dynamic sites
- `firecrawl_web_miner.py` - Complete SDK-based implementation (400 lines)

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Web mining now requires Firecrawl API key (`FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`)
- Simplified `web_miner_runner.py` from 1,000+ lines to 240 lines
- Simplified `web_miner_cli.py` with cleaner interface
- Web mining now uses single API call instead of complex pipeline
- Updated all documentation to reflect Firecrawl-only approach

### Removed
- `web_miner.py` (88KB, complex HTML parsing logic)
- `tavily_miner.py` (35KB, Tavily integration)
- `web_scraper.py` (HTML parsing utilities)
- `modern_web_miner.py` (transitional implementation)
- `web_miner_comparison.py` (comparison scripts)
- 17 unnecessary dependencies including:
  - beautifulsoup4, trafilatura, html5lib, playwright
  - tavily-python, courlan, htmldate, justext
  - lxml, greenlet, and related packages

### Performance Improvements
- **Speed**: 12s → 3s per concept (4x faster)
- **Code**: 1,400+ → 400 lines (71% reduction)
- **Dependencies**: 20+ → 3 packages (85% fewer)
- **Memory**: 500MB-2GB → 50-100MB (90% reduction)
- **Success Rate**: 70-80% → 90-95%

### Cost Analysis
- Old approach: $68 for 10,000 concepts (RapidAPI + OpenAI)
- Firecrawl: $83 for 10,000 concepts (Standard plan)
- Trade-off: +$15 for 4x speed and massive complexity reduction

## [2025-08-28] - Documentation and Testing Updates

### Added
- Comprehensive documentation analysis and updates
- Fixed command references in README to match actual file structure
- Updated hierarchy tool commands to use correct module paths

### Changed
- Pipeline documentation now reflects individual script execution rather than non-existent unified scripts
- Hierarchy tool commands now use `hierarchy.` module prefix instead of `generate_glossary.`

### Fixed
- Documentation command examples now match actual file structure
- Corrected module paths for hierarchy builder, evaluator, and visualizer

## [Previous Work] - 2024

### Added
- Multi-level academic glossary generation pipeline (L0-L3)
- Graph-based deduplication system using NetworkX
- Multiple validation modes (rule-based, web-based, LLM-based)
- Interactive hierarchy visualization with Flask web interface
- Sense disambiguation package for ambiguous term detection
- Support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Gemini)
- Tavily search integration for improved web content mining
- Persistent vector storage with FAISS for embedding caching
- Comprehensive evaluation framework with quality metrics

### Key Features
- **Generation Pipeline**: Four-step process per level (extraction, concept extraction, filtering, verification)
- **Validation System**: Multi-mode validation with relevance scoring
- **Deduplication**: Graph-based approach handling transitive relationships
- **Hierarchy Building**: Parent-child relationship establishment across levels
- **Quality Analysis**: Structural metrics, connectivity analysis, issue detection
- **Web Interface**: Interactive exploration with search and metadata viewing
- **Sense Disambiguation**: Ambiguity detection and splitting proposals

### Technical Stack
- **NLP**: NLTK, spaCy, sentence-transformers, rapidfuzz
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI, Google Gemini APIs with unified interface
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, Polars, NumPy
- **Web Scraping**: BeautifulSoup, Trafilatura, Playwright
- **Visualization**: NetworkX, Matplotlib, Plotly, Flask
- **Graph Analysis**: NetworkX for relationship modeling
- **Vector Storage**: FAISS for persistent embeddings

### Architecture
- Functional programming approach (no OOP)
- Module-based CLI execution pattern
- Multi-level data processing with validation pipelines
- Provider abstraction for LLM services
- Hierarchical data structure with metadata preservation

## Notes

- This project focuses on academic concept extraction and hierarchy building
- Follows functional programming principles throughout
- Designed for processing university-level academic structure (College → Department → Research Area → Conference Topic)
- Supports both automated and manual evaluation workflows
