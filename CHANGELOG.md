  - **Search Categories**: Filter searches by `research` category for academic content
  - **Batch Scraping**: Native batch scraping support for parallel URL processing
  - **Enhanced Extraction**: Multi-entity prompts with `enableWebSearch` for additional context
  - **v2 Search Format**: Support for new `sources` and `categories` parameters

### Changed
- **Updated search function** to use v2 search API with research category filtering
- **Enhanced extraction** with `enableWebSearch`, `allowExternalLinks`, and `includeSubdomains` parameters
- **Added caching layer** with `scrape_urls_with_cache()` function using maxAge parameter
