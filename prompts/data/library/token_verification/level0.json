Academic relevance - Is it a recognized field of study or broad academic discipline?\n2. Disciplinary context - Does it represent a major division of knowledge in academia?\n3. Scope - Is it broad enough to encompass multiple research areas or subdisciplines?\n\nAccept:\n- Broad academic disciplines (e.g., humanities, sciences, engineering)\n- Major fields of study (e.g., arts, medicine, law)\n- Traditional knowledge domains (e.g., social sciences, natural sciences)\n\nDO NOT accept:\n- Narrow specializations or subdisciplines (e.g., organic chemistry, medieval history)\n- Technical methodologies (e.g., spectroscopy, chromatography)\n- Specific research topics (e.g., climate change, artificial intelligence)\n- Acronyms (e.g., STEM, AI) unless they are universally recognized as standalone concepts\n- Proper nouns or names (e.g., Harvard, MIT)\n- Informal or colloquial terms (e.g., stuff, thing)\n- General English words without specific academic meaning",
