# README: Glossary Project Documentation

**Last Updated**: December 2024

## 📁 Documentation Structure

This folder contains the comprehensive documentation for the Universal Academic Glossary project.

## 📄 Core Documents

### Strategic Documents
1. **`executive-summary-updated.md`** ⭐
   - One-page overview of the entire project
   - Key positioning: Building infrastructure, not proposing methods
   - Quick facts and impact projections

2. **`project-framework.md`** 📊
   - Comprehensive framework document
   - Detailed inputs, outputs, objectives
   - Implementation strategy
   - Evaluation metrics

3. **`research-positioning.md`** 🎯
   - How we fit in the research landscape
   - Comparison with existing work
   - Literature context and gaps

### Research Documents
4. **`Comprehensive Literature Survey.md`** 📚
   - Detailed analysis of 2020-2025 literature
   - Six key areas of NLP and knowledge extraction
   - Evidence for our approach

5. **`bibliography.md`** 📖
   - Complete reference list with annotations
   - Core papers organized by topic
   - Supporting evidence and fact-checking

### Historical Documents
6. **`executive-summary.md`** (Original)
   - Initial framing focused on methodology
   - Kept for comparison with updated vision

### Technical Documents
7. **`mining_api_reference.md`**
   - API documentation for term extraction
   - Technical implementation details

8. **`v2_2_0_migration_guide.md`**
   - Version migration documentation
   - Technical updates

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### The Fundamental Reframing
**Original Vision**: Propose a quality control framework for terminology extraction

**Current Vision**: Build the actual glossary - the "WordNet of academic research"

### Core Innovation
Not in the techniques (which exist) but in:
- Actually building the resource at scale
- Ensuring quality properties
- Making it extensible and verifiable
- Creating infrastructure for academic NLP

## 📊 Project Statistics

- **Target Scale**: 100,000+ validated terms
- **Coverage**: All major academic disciplines  
- **Quality Target**: >95% accuracy
- **Timeline**: 24 months development
- **Expected Impact**: 1000+ institutions, 100+ applications

## 🎯 Reading Order

For understanding the project:
1. Start with **`executive-summary-updated.md`** for overview
2. Read **`project-framework.md`** for details
3. Review **`research-positioning.md`** for context
4. Consult **`bibliography.md`** for references

For research depth:
1. **`Comprehensive Literature Survey.md`** for full analysis
2. **`bibliography.md`** for detailed citations

## 💡 Key Takeaway

**We are not proposing how to build glossaries. We are actually building THE glossary for academic research.**

This is infrastructure creation, not methodology innovation - similar to how WordNet was built for English and UMLS for medicine, we're building for academic research.

## 🔗 Related Resources

### Precedent Projects
- **WordNet**: General English lexical database
- **UMLS**: Unified Medical Language System
- **Gene Ontology**: Biological concept standardization
- **AWL**: Academic Word List (limited predecessor)

### Closest Existing Work
- **INTEROP Glossary Methodology**: Manual, limited scale
- **OneKE (2024)**: Extraction framework, not glossary
- **Domain glossaries**: Partial, unintegrated

## 📈 Impact Projections

Based on similar resources:
- **WordNet**: 30,000+ citations, fundamental to NLP
- **UMLS**: 2M+ concepts, thousands of applications
- **Our Target**: 1000+ citations, 100+ applications, 1M+ API calls/month

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Resource Aggregation**: Collect existing partial glossaries
2. **Quality Framework**: Implement validation pipeline
3. **Scaling**: Build to 100,000+ terms
4. **Deployment**: API and distribution infrastructure
5. **Adoption**: Community engagement and growth
