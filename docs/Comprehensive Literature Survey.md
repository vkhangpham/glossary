# Comprehensive Literature Survey: NLP and Knowledge Extraction Tasks (2020-2025)

## The transformation of knowledge extraction through neural architectures and large language models

This comprehensive literature survey examines six key areas of NLP and knowledge extraction research from 2020-2025, revealing a fundamental paradigm shift from traditional statistical methods to neural architectures and large language model (LLM) integration. The field has witnessed unprecedented advances in automated knowledge construction, with transformer-based models establishing new performance standards across all surveyed domains. This transformation has particularly impacted academic and educational applications, where automated terminology extraction and hierarchical concept organization are revolutionizing curriculum development and knowledge management systems.

## 1. Terminology Extraction and Term Recognition

### Methodological evolution from statistical foundations to neural dominance

The terminology extraction field has undergone a dramatic transformation since 2020, with neural approaches achieving **15-25% F1-score improvements** over traditional statistical methods on complex datasets. The evolution began with foundational statistical approaches—TF-IDF, C-value/NC-value, and mutual information metrics—which established core principles of unithood (collocation strength) and termhood (domain specificity) that remain influential today.

The integration of transformer-based models marks the most significant advance. **BERT-BiLSTM-CRF architectures** have become the dominant approach, combining pre-trained contextual embeddings with sequence labeling capabilities. Domain-specific variants like BioBERT and ClinicalBERT demonstrate the importance of specialized pre-training, while **XLM-RoBERTa** extends capabilities to multilingual scenarios. Recent innovations include Hierarchical Self-Attention Networks (HSAN) that address BERT's computational overhead while maintaining performance, and graph-based neural methods integrating Graph Neural Networks with language models for enhanced keyphrase extraction.

### State-of-the-art techniques and evaluation frameworks

The establishment of standardized evaluation frameworks represents a crucial development. The **ACTER dataset** (2020) provides over 100,000 manual annotations across three languages and four domains, while **TermEval 2020** created the first comprehensive benchmark for comparative research. These frameworks revealed significant performance variations between systems, highlighting that no single approach dominates across all term types.

Current SOTA methods combine multiple approaches: **ViBERTgrid BiLSTM-CRF** achieves 2% improvement in financial document processing through multimodal transformer adaptation, while hierarchical inference schemes like **HSMP BERT** demonstrate 9.5% F1 improvement on NER tasks and 11.2% on term extraction. The emergence of prompt-based approaches using GPT-4 shows promise, with **ChatGPT outperforming traditional unsupervised methods** in clinical domains, though computational costs remain prohibitive for large-scale deployment.

### Challenges and research gaps

Despite advances, several challenges persist. **Nested term extraction** ("machine learning algorithm" containing both "machine learning" and "algorithm") remains problematic, while **cross-disciplinary terminology** spanning multiple academic fields poses disambiguation challenges. The field lacks comprehensive evaluation metrics that account for context dependency and term hierarchy, with annotation subjectivity creating inconsistencies even among domain experts.

## 2. Hierarchical Concept Extraction and Organization

### Algorithmic approaches spanning clustering to large language models

Hierarchical concept extraction has evolved from traditional clustering-based methods to sophisticated neural architectures. **Pattern-based approaches** using Hearst patterns remain foundational, with the **Hypert framework** (2023) introducing hypernymy-aware BERT pretraining that addresses word2vec limitations. The most significant innovation involves **box embeddings** that represent hierarchical relationships through geometric containment rather than single vectors, enabling more nuanced concept organization.

The **TaxoComplete framework** (2023) exemplifies modern approaches, using self-supervised learning with position-enhanced semantic matching and direction-aware propagation. This combines query-anchor mechanisms with graph neural networks to capture both semantic and structural features. **TaxoEnrich** (2022) further advances the field through structure-semantic representations, achieving state-of-the-art performance on taxonomy completion tasks.

### Large language model integration revolutionizing concept hierarchies

The **LLMs4OL Challenge** (2024) marked a watershed moment, providing the first large-scale evaluation of LLMs for ontology learning tasks. Results demonstrate that LLMs excel at term typing (WordNet 99.38% F1) but struggle with complex biological taxonomies (20-30% F1). The **CodeTaxo** approach (2024) innovatively uses code language prompts for taxonomy expansion, outperforming natural language approaches—a surprising finding that suggests structured reasoning benefits from programming language representations.

End-to-end ontology learning with LLMs introduces custom regularizers to reduce overfitting on high-frequency concepts, while multi-level attention mechanisms capture different granularities of conceptual relationships. Cross-attention layers enable lightweight taxonomy discovery without full model fine-tuning, making these approaches computationally feasible for academic institutions.

### Educational applications and cross-institutional validation

Educational technology represents a primary application domain. The **BEA Workshop series** (2023-2025) has focused extensively on NLP applications for educational contexts, developing AI Teacher systems using hierarchical concept structures for conversational learning. These systems enable **adaptive content organization** that adjusts to individual learning paths, while competency modeling maps learning objectives to hierarchical structures.

Cross-institutional validation remains challenging due to vocabulary gaps and varying abstraction levels across domains. Multi-institutional datasets are emerging to address this, with standardization efforts working toward common frameworks for educational concept organization. Quality metrics specifically designed for pedagogical effectiveness are being developed, though consensus on evaluation criteria remains elusive.

## 3. Ontology Learning and Knowledge Graph Construction

### End-to-end pipelines transforming knowledge representation

The comprehensive survey by **Zhong et al. (2023)** reviewing over 300 methods establishes the standard three-step framework: knowledge acquisition, refinement, and evolution. Traditional pipelines involving corpus preparation, terminology extraction, taxonomy construction, and axiom discovery are being replaced by end-to-end systems. **EasyKG** (2020) introduced pluggable pipeline architecture with drag-and-drop customization, while recent **LLM-powered approaches** (2025) using Google Palm 2 achieve multi-domain application with minimal manual intervention.

The **Text2KGBench** (2023) provides crucial evaluation infrastructure with Wikidata-TekGen (10 ontologies, 13,474 sentences) and DBpedia-WebNLG (19 ontologies, 4,860 sentences) datasets. These benchmarks evaluate both faithfulness to input text and ontology compliance, addressing previous limitations in systematic evaluation.

### Neural architectures versus traditional pattern-based methods

The **LLMs4OL Challenge** results reveal nuanced performance patterns: GPT-4 excels as an inference assistant rather than a few-shot information extractor, while smaller models like Flan-T5-Small (80M parameters) achieve competitive performance with appropriate task framing. The **OLLM framework** (2024) builds taxonomic backbones from scratch using custom regularizers, outperforming subtask composition methods on Wikipedia and arXiv domains.

Relation extraction has advanced significantly through **distant supervision denoising**. Knowledge Graph Attention (KGATT) mechanisms provide fine-alignment, while Fine-Grained Semantic Information (FGSI) enables sentence segmentation based on entity positions. Graph Transformer architectures (BERT-GT) handle cross-sentence n-ary relations, addressing previous limitations in complex relationship extraction.

### Applications in academic domains

Academic implementations demonstrate practical impact. The **Framework Materials Knowledge Graph** (Nature 2024) processed 100,000+ articles to create 2.53M nodes and 4.01M relationships, enabling advanced scientific question-answering. **AIREG** (2024) combines LLMs with knowledge graphs for educational recommender systems, while research knowledge graphs paradigms are transforming scholarly information representation.

Domain-specific challenges include entity disambiguation in specialized contexts, temporal knowledge representation, and cross-domain transfer. Long-tail relation distribution creates significant imbalances, with up to 30% error rates in noisy distant supervision labels. These challenges are being addressed through prompt engineering for domain adaptation and multi-agent collaboration frameworks.

## 4. Glossary Construction and Academic Vocabulary Building

### Automated pipelines achieving pedagogical relevance

Modern glossary construction follows sophisticated multi-stage pipelines combining linguistic filters, statistical methods, and neural approaches. The preprocessing stage employs standard NLP techniques, followed by candidate term extraction using noun phrases and adjective-noun patterns. Term scoring combines unithood and termhood measures, with semantic filtering using contextual embeddings for final selection.

The distinction between **definition extraction and generation** represents a crucial methodological divide. Rule-based mining uses grammatical patterns ("X is defined as Y"), while WordNet-based selection performs sense disambiguation using contextual similarity. Generative approaches have evolved rapidly: GPT-2/GPT-3 fine-tuning on definition datasets, BERT-based masked language modeling for definition completion, and sophisticated prompt engineering with large language models produce increasingly natural definitions.

### Cross-institutional standardization enabling collaboration

Standardization across institutions employs multiple strategies. **Multilingual terminology alignment** uses cross-lingual transfer learning with mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa, while parallel corpus analysis enables bilingual terminology extraction. Linked Data principles using RDF and ontological structures provide formal representation frameworks, with ensemble methods combining multiple alignment approaches for robust standardization.

Educational technology integration has produced practical applications. Automatic textbook glossary generation from PDFs uses linguistic pattern recognition to identify and extract key terms. Adaptive learning systems assess vocabulary difficulty for personalized term introduction, while cross-curriculum alignment standardizes vocabulary across educational materials. The **LAK Dataset and AFEL Glossary Projects** demonstrate collaborative glossary development using linked data principles for the learning analytics community.

### Evaluation challenges and practical deployment

Evaluation methodologies combine automatic and human assessment. Automatic evaluation uses precision, recall, and F1-scores against gold-standard glossaries, with BLEU/ROUGE scores assessing definition quality. Human evaluation involves expert annotation for domain relevance, inter-annotator agreement measurement, and user studies examining educational effectiveness.

Current challenges include polysemy handling in context-dependent disambiguation, limited cross-domain generalization, and high computational requirements for transformer models. Long-tail terminology extraction remains problematic, with rare but domain-relevant terms often missed. The lack of standardized benchmarks prevents systematic comparison across systems, while the gap between laboratory and practical performance raises questions about real-world deployment.

## 5. Multi-Source Information Integration and Validation

### Integration architectures managing heterogeneous sources

Multi-source integration employs three primary architectural patterns. **Voting-based systems** use majority voting for classification with weighted voting based on source reliability. **Probabilistic approaches** apply Dempster-Shafer evidence theory for conflict resolution and Bayesian fusion for uncertainty handling. **Neural fusion architectures** implement feature-level fusion with attention mechanisms and hierarchical multi-view networks for complex integration tasks.

The **KnowEE framework** (EMNLP 2023) exemplifies modern approaches, exploring multi-source multi-type knowledge from LLMs through two-phase fine-grained and coarse-grained knowledge injection. **SKIE** (2024) integrates structural semantic knowledge using Abstract Meaning Representation with contrastive learning and enhanced graph topology, demonstrating how cohesive subgraphs provide diverse multi-level knowledge.

### Statistical validation and quality assurance

Frequency-based validation employs bootstrap aggregating for variance reduction and statistical distribution analysis using KL divergence. Consensus building techniques compare outputs across sources, with conflict resolution through coherence analysis and adaptive processing using reinforcement learning. Information fusion based on minimum fuzzy entropy provides principled approaches to uncertainty handling.

Machine learning approaches to source weighting have evolved from simple ensemble methods to sophisticated deep learning fusion. Snapshot ensembling from single training runs reduces computational overhead, while multi-modal contrastive learning enables cross-modal validation. Attention-based feature fusion mechanisms dynamically adjust source importance based on context, with automatic source reliability scoring providing quality assessment.

### Challenges in cross-institutional validation

Technical challenges include data inconsistency when handling conflicting information, scalability issues with increasing source numbers, and quality variation across information sources. Methodological challenges involve ensuring consistency across organizational standards, transferring knowledge across domains, and handling evolving source reliability over time.

Academic applications demonstrate practical value. Multi-institutional collaboration creates comprehensive knowledge bases with cross-validation of extracted facts. Literature review automation synthesizes findings from multiple papers while resolving contradictory results. Educational content generation integrates curriculum materials from multiple institutions with quality assessment ensuring pedagogical effectiveness.

## 6. LLM-based Knowledge Extraction

### Paradigm shift from traditional NLP to prompt engineering

The transition from traditional NLP to LLM-based approaches represents the most significant paradigm shift in knowledge extraction. Pre-2022 methods relied on part-of-speech tagging and rule-based systems, while 2022-2025 has seen wholesale adoption of instruction-tuned LLMs. The **LLMs4OL 2024 Challenge** demonstrated LLM potential for automated ontology construction, establishing community benchmarks and best practices.

Model evolution shows clear progression: GPT-3/3.5 enabled early zero-shot extraction, GPT-4/4o enhanced complex reasoning and multi-hop extraction, while the LLaMA family (2-3-3.1) provides open-source alternatives with competitive performance. Domain-specific models like **BioMistral-7B** and **OpenBioLLM-8B** demonstrate the value of specialized pre-training for technical domains.

### Prompt engineering strategies maximizing extraction performance

Effective prompt engineering follows established patterns. **Task demonstration with retrieval** proves most effective, using dynamic context gathering from knowledge bases with 3-5 examples selected via retrieval mechanisms. This significantly outperforms zero-shot approaches across all tested models. **Chain-of-Thought integration** using the CRISPE framework enables systematic extraction through step-by-step entity and relation identification, particularly effective for complex biomedical and geographical domains.

**Schema-guided prompting** with pre-defined ontology schemas improves extraction accuracy while addressing context window limitations. Hybrid strategies combining simple instructions with task demonstration consistently outperform complex reasoning-oriented prompts, suggesting that context quality matters more than prompt complexity.

### Performance benchmarks and hybrid approaches

Zero-shot performance varies dramatically by domain: WordNet achieves 94%+ F1 while biological domains struggle at 20-30% F1. Few-shot learning with 3-5 examples yields optimal improvements, with retrieval-augmented examples outperforming random selection. Fine-tuned smaller models often outperform large zero-shot models—GPT-3.5-Turbo with fine-tuning matches GPT-4 zero-shot performance at lower cost.

Hybrid approaches combining LLMs with traditional methods show particular promise. **GraphRAG** demonstrates superior correctness over pure vector approaches, while LLM + Symbolic AI integration (77 studies reviewed) combines generative capabilities with structured reasoning. Multi-stage pipelines using traditional NER with LLM relation extraction balance computational efficiency with extraction quality.

## Major Cross-Cutting Themes and Future Directions

### Convergence toward unified frameworks

The surveyed literature reveals strong convergence toward unified frameworks combining multiple methodologies. Pure statistical or rule-based approaches are largely obsolete, replaced by hybrid systems leveraging both neural and symbolic reasoning. The integration of LLMs across all six areas suggests these models are becoming the foundational technology for knowledge extraction, though computational costs and hallucination risks require careful management.

### Educational domain as primary beneficiary

Academic and educational applications emerge as primary beneficiaries of these advances.
