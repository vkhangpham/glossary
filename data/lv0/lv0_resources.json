      "raw_content": "Contents\n\nArt\n\n\n\nArt is a diverse range of cultural activity centered around works utilizing creative or imaginative talents, which are expected to evoke a worthwhile experience,[1] generally through an expression of emotional power, conceptual ideas, technical proficiency, and/or beauty.[2][3][4]\n\nThere is no generally agreed definition of what constitutes art,[5][6][7] and its interpretation has varied greatly throughout history and across cultures. In the Western tradition, the three classical branches of visual art are painting, sculpture, and architecture.[8] Theatre, dance, and other performing arts, as well as literature, music, film and other media such as interactive media, are included in a broader definition of \"the arts\".[2][9] Until the 17th century, art referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from crafts or sciences. In modern usage after the 17th century, where aesthetic considerations are paramount, the fine arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general, such as the decorative or applied arts.\n\nThe nature of art and related concepts, such as creativity and interpretation, are explored in a branch of philosophy known as aesthetics.[10] The resulting artworks are studied in the professional fields of art criticism and the history of art.\n\nOverview\n\nIn the perspective of the history of art,[11] artistic works have existed for almost as long as humankind: from early prehistoric art to contemporary art; however, some theorists think that the typical concept of \"artistic works\" does not fit well outside modern Western societies.[12] One early sense of the definition of art is closely related to the older Latin meaning, which roughly translates to \"skill\" or \"craft\", as associated with words such as \"artisan\". English words derived from this meaning include artifact, artificial, artifice, medical arts, and military arts. However, there are many other colloquial uses of the word, all with some relation to its etymology.\n\nOver time, philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Socrates and Immanuel Kant, among others, questioned the meaning of art.[13] Several dialogues in Plato tackle questions about art, while Socrates says that poetry is inspired by the muses and is not rational. He speaks approvingly of this, and other forms of divine madness (drunkenness, eroticism, and dreaming) in the Phaedrus (265a–c), and yet in the Republic wants to outlaw Homer's great poetic art, and laughter as well. In Ion, Socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of Homer that he expresses in the Republic. The dialogue Ion suggests that Homer's Iliad functioned in the ancient Greek world as the Bible does today in the modern Christian world: as divinely inspired literary art that can provide moral guidance, if only it can be properly interpreted.[14]\n\nWith regards to the literary art and the musical arts, Aristotle considered epic poetry, tragedy, comedy, Dithyrambic poetry and music to be mimetic or imitative art, each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner.[15] For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation—through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.[16] Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals.[17]\n\nThe more recent and specific sense of the word art as an abbreviation for creative art or fine art emerged in the early 17th century.[18] Fine art refers to a skill used to express the artist's creativity, or to engage the audience's aesthetic sensibilities, or to draw the audience towards consideration of more refined or finer works of art.\n\nWithin this latter sense, the word art may refer to several things: (i) a study of a creative skill, (ii) a process of using the creative skill, (iii) a product of the creative skill, or (iv) the audience's experience with the creative skill. The creative arts (art as discipline) are a collection of disciplines which produce artworks (art as objects) that are compelled by a personal drive (art as activity) and convey a message, mood, or symbolism for the perceiver to interpret (art as experience). Art is something that stimulates an individual's thoughts, emotions, beliefs, or ideas through the senses. Works of art can be explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the basis of images or objects. For some scholars, such as Kant, the sciences and the arts could be distinguished by taking science as representing the domain of knowledge and the arts as representing the domain of the freedom of artistic expression.[19]\n\nOften, if the skill is being used in a common or practical way, people will consider it a craft instead of art. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way, it may be considered commercial art instead of fine art. On the other hand, crafts and design are sometimes considered applied art. Some art followers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference.[20] However, even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression. The purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas, such as in politically, spiritually, or philosophically motivated art; to create a sense of beauty (see aesthetics); to explore the nature of perception; for pleasure; or to generate strong emotions. The purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent.\n\nThe nature of art has been described by philosopher Richard Wollheim as \"one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture\".[21] Art has been defined as a vehicle for the expression or communication of emotions and ideas, a means for exploring and appreciating formal elements for their own sake, and as mimesis or representation. Art as mimesis has deep roots in the philosophy of Aristotle.[22] Leo Tolstoy identified art as a use of indirect means to communicate from one person to another.[22] Benedetto Croce and R. G. Collingwood advanced the idealist view that art expresses emotions, and that the work of art therefore essentially exists in the mind of the creator.[23][24] The theory of art as form has its roots in the philosophy of Kant, and was developed in the early 20th century by Roger Fry and Clive Bell. More recently, thinkers influenced by Martin Heidegger have interpreted art as the means by which a community develops for itself a medium for self-expression and interpretation.[25] George Dickie has offered an institutional theory of art that defines a work of art as any artifact upon which a qualified person or persons acting on behalf of the social institution commonly referred to as \"the art world\" has conferred \"the status of candidate for appreciation\".[26] Larry Shiner has described fine art as \"not an essence or a fate but something we have made. Art as we have generally understood it is a European invention barely two hundred years old.\"[27]\n\nArt may be characterized in terms of mimesis (its representation of reality), narrative (storytelling), expression, communication of emotion, or other qualities. During the Romantic period, art came to be seen as \"a special faculty of the human mind to be classified with religion and science\".[28]\n\nHistory\n\nA shell engraved by Homo erectus was determined to be between 430,000 and 540,000 years old.[30] A set of eight 130,000 years old white-tailed eagle talons bear cut marks and abrasion that indicate manipulation by neanderthals, possibly for using it as jewelry.[31] A series of tiny, drilled snail shells about 75,000 years old—were discovered in a South African cave.",

Geographically, it spans the entire Indian subcontinent, including what is now India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, and at times eastern Afghanistan. A strong sense of design is characteristic of Indian art and can be observed in its modern and traditional forms.\n\nThe origin of Indian art can be traced to prehistoric settlements in the 3rd millennium BCE. On its way to modern times, Indian art has had cultural influences, as well as religious influences such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism and Islam. In spite of this complex mixture of religious traditions, generally, the prevailing artistic style at any time and place has been shared by the major religious groups.\n\nIn historic art, sculpture in stone and metal, mainly religious, has survived the Indian climate better than other media and provides most of the best remains. Many of the most important ancient finds that are not in carved stone come from the surrounding, drier regions rather than India itself. Indian funeral and philosophic traditions exclude grave goods, which is the main source of ancient art in other cultures.\n\nIndian artist styles historically followed Indian religions out of the subcontinent, having an especially large influence in Tibet, South East Asia and China. Indian art has itself received influences at times, especially from Central Asia and Iran, and Europe.\n\nEarly Indian art\n\nRock Art\n\nRock art of India includes rock relief carvings, engravings and paintings, some (but by no means all) from the South Asian Stone Age. It is estimated there are about 1300 rock art sites with over a quarter of a million figures and figurines.[1] The earliest rock carvings in India were discovered by Archibald Carlleyle, twelve years before the Cave of Altamira in Spain,[2] although his work only came to light much later via J Cockburn (1899).[3]\n\nDr. V. S. Wakankar discovered several painted rock shelters in Central India, situated around the Vindhya mountain range. Of these, the c. 750 sites making up the Bhimbetka rock shelters have been enrolled as a UNESCO World Heritage Site; the earliest paintings are some 10,000 years old.[4][5][6][7][8] The paintings in these sites commonly depicted scenes of human life alongside animals, and hunts with stone implements. Their style varied with region and age, but the most common characteristic was a red wash made using a powdered mineral called geru, which is a form of iron oxide (hematite).[9]\n\nIndus Valley civilisation (c. 3300 BCE – c. 1750 BCE)\n\nDespite its wide spread and sophistication, the Indus Valley civilisation seems to have taken no interest in public large-scale art, unlike many other early civilizations. A number of gold, terracotta and stone figurines of girls in dancing poses reveal the presence of some forms of dance. Additionally, the terracotta figurines included cows, bears, monkeys, and dogs.\n\nBy far the most common form of figurative art found is small carved seals.  Thousands of steatite seals have been recovered, and their physical character is fairly consistent. In size they range from 3⁄4 inch to 11⁄2 inches square. In most cases they have a pierced boss at the back to accommodate a cord for handling or for use as personal adornment. Seals have been found at Mohenjo-Daro depicting a figure standing on its head, and another, on the Pashupati Seal, sitting cross-legged in a yoga-like pose. This figure has been variously identified. Sir John Marshall identified a resemblance to the Hindu god, Shiva.[10]\n\nThe animal depicted on a majority of seals at sites of the mature period has not been clearly identified. Part bull, part zebra, with a majestic horn, it has been a source of speculation. As yet, there is insufficient evidence to substantiate claims that the image had religious or cultist significance, but the prevalence of the image raises the question of whether or not the animals in images of the IVC are religious symbols.[11] The most famous piece is the bronze Dancing Girl of Mohenjo-Daro, which shows remarkably advanced modelling of the human figure for this early date.[12]\n\nAfter the end of the Indus Valley Civilization, there is a surprising absence of art of any great degree of sophistication until the Buddhist era.  It is thought that this partly reflects the use of perishable organic materials such as wood.[13]\n\nVedic period\n\nThe millennium following the collapse of the Indus Valley civilisation, coinciding with the Indo-Aryan migration during the Vedic period, is devoid of anthropomorphical depictions.[14] It has been suggested that the early Vedic religion focused exclusively on the worship of purely \"elementary forces of nature by means of elaborate sacrifices\", which did not lend themselves easily to anthropomorphological representations.[15][16] Various artefacts may belong to the Copper Hoard culture (2nd millennium BCE), some of them suggesting anthropomorphological characteristics.[17] Interpretations vary as to the exact signification of these artifacts, or even the culture and the periodization to which they belonged.[17] Some examples of artistic expression also appear in abstract pottery designs during the Black and red ware culture (1450-1200 BCE) or the Painted Grey Ware culture (1200-600 BCE), with finds in a wide area, including the area of Mathura.[17]\n\nAfter a gap of about a thousand years, most of the early finds correspond to what is called the \"second period of urbanization\" in the middle of the 1st millennium BCE.[17] The anthropomorphic depiction of various deities apparently started in the middle of the 1st millennium BCE, possibly as a consequence of the influx of foreign stimuli initiated with the Achaemenid conquest of the Indus Valley, and the rise of alternative local faiths challenging Vedism, such as Buddhism, Jainism and local popular cults.[14]\n\nMauryan art (c. 322 BCE – c.",

Le Saut dans le Vide (Leap into the Void).\nPerformance art is an artwork or art exhibition created through actions executed by the artist or other participants. It may be witnessed live or through documentation, spontaneously developed or written, and is traditionally presented to a public in a fine art context in an interdisciplinary mode.[1] Also known as artistic action, it has been developed through the years as a genre of its own in which art is presented live. It had an important and fundamental role in 20th century avant-garde art.[2][3]\nIt involves five basic elements: time, space, body, presence of the artist, and the relation between the artist and the public. The actions, generally developed in art galleries and museums, can take place in any kind of setting or space, and during any time period.[4] Its goal is to generate a reaction, sometimes with the support of improvisation and a sense of aesthetics. The themes are commonly linked to life experiences of the artist themselves, the need for denunciation or social criticism and with a spirit of transformation.[5]\nThe term \"performance art\" and \"performance\" became widely used in the 1970s, even though the history of performance in visual arts dates back to futurist productions and cabarets from the 1910s.[6][1] Art critic and performance artist John Perreault credits Marjorie Strider with the invention of the term in 1969.[7] The main pioneers of performance art include Carolee Schneemann,[8] Marina Abramović,[9] Ana Mendieta,[10] Chris Burden,[11] Hermann Nitsch, Joseph Beuys, Nam June Paik, Tehching Hsieh, Yves Klein and Vito Acconci.[12] Some of the main exponents more recently are Tania Bruguera,[13] Abel Azcona,[14] Regina José Galindo,[15] Marta Minujín,[16] Melati Suryodarmo and Petr Pavlensky. The discipline is linked to the happenings and \"events\" of the Fluxus movement, Viennese Actionism, body art and conceptual art.[17]\nDefinition\n[edit]\n\nHelen Moller[18][19][20][21] dance performance. Photo by Arnold Genthe, early 20th century.\n\nGeorgia O'Keeffe, photographed during a performative process, 1919\nThe definition and historical and pedagogical contextualization of performance art is controversial. One of the handicaps comes from the term itself, which is polysemic, and one of its meanings relates to the scenic arts. This meaning of \"performance\" in the scenic-arts context differs radically from the concept of \"performance art\", since performance art emerged with a critical and antagonistic position towards scenic arts. Performance art only adjoins the scenic arts in certain aspects such as the audience and the present body, and still not every performance-art piece contains these elements.[22]\nThe meaning of the term \"performance art\" in the narrower sense is related to postmodernist traditions in Western culture. From about the mid-1960s into the 1970s, often derived from concepts of visual art, with respect to Antonin Artaud, Dada, the Situationists, Fluxus, installation art, and conceptual art, performance art tended to be defined as an antithesis to theatre, challenging orthodox art-forms and cultural norms. The ideal had been an ephemeral and authentic experience for performer and audience in an event that could not be repeated, captured or purchased.[23] The widely discussed difference, how concepts of visual arts and concepts of performing arts are used, can determine the meanings of a performance-art presentation.[22]\n\"Performance art\" is a term usually reserved to refer to a conceptual art that conveys a content-based meaning in a more drama-related sense, rather than being simple performance for its own sake for entertainment purposes. It largely refers to a performance presented to an audience, but which does not seek to present a conventional theatrical play or a formal linear narrative, or which alternately does not seek to depict a set of fictitious characters in formal scripted interactions. It therefore can include action or spoken word as a communication between the artist and audience, or even ignore expectations of an audience, rather than following a script written beforehand.\nSome types of performance art nevertheless can be close to performing arts. Such performance may use a script or create a fictitious dramatic setting, but still constitute performance art in that it does not seek to follow the usual dramatic norm of creating a fictitious setting with a linear script which follows conventional real-world dynamics; rather, it would intentionally seek to satirize or to transcend the usual real-world dynamics which are used in conventional theatrical plays.\nPerformance artists often challenge the audience to think in new and unconventional ways, break conventions of traditional arts, and break down conventional ideas about \"what art is\".",
      "processed_content": "Performance art is a form of art where the artwork is created through actions performed by the artist or participants, presented live or documented within a fine art context. Emerging partly as an alternative to traditional theatre and visual arts, it focuses on elements like the artist's body, time, space, and the interaction with the audience. This genre aims to generate a reaction and convey meaning through often ephemeral experiences, challenging conventional notions of what constitutes art.",

European prehistoric art started as mobile Upper Paleolithic rock and cave painting and petroglyph art and was characteristic of the period between the Paleolithic and the Iron Age.[4]  Written histories of European art often begin with the Aegean civilizations, dating from the 3rd millennium BC. However a consistent pattern of artistic development within Europe becomes clear only with Ancient Greek art, which was adopted and transformed by Rome and carried; with the Roman Empire, across much of Europe, North Africa and Western Asia.[5]\n\nThe influence of the art of the Classical period waxed and waned throughout the next two thousand years, seeming to slip into a distant memory in parts of the Medieval period, to re-emerge in the Renaissance, suffer a period of what some early art historians viewed as \"decay\" during the Baroque period,[6] to reappear in a refined form in Neo-Classicism[7] and to be reborn in Post-Modernism.[8]\n\nBefore the 1800s, the Christian church was a major influence on European art, and commissions from the Church provided the major source of work for artists. In the same period there was also a renewed interest in classical mythology, great wars, heroes and heroines, and themes not connected to religion.[9] Most art of the last 200 years has been produced without reference to religion and often with no particular ideology at all, but art has often been influenced by political issues, whether reflecting the concerns of patrons or the artist.\n\nEuropean art is arranged into a number of stylistic periods, which, historically, overlap each other as different styles flourished in different areas. Broadly the periods are, Classical, Byzantine, Medieval, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, Rococo, Neoclassical, Modern, Postmodern and New European Painting.[9]\n\nPrehistoric art\n\nEuropean prehistoric art is an important part of the European cultural heritage.[10]  Prehistoric art history is usually divided into four main periods: Stone Age, Neolithic, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. Most of the remaining artifacts of this period are small sculptures and cave paintings.\n\nMuch surviving prehistoric art is small portable sculptures, with a small group of female Venus figurines such as the Venus of Willendorf (24,000–22,000 BC) found across central Europe;[11] the 30 cm tall Löwenmensch figurine of about 30,000 BCE has hardly any pieces that can be related to it.  The Swimming Reindeer of about 11,000 BCE is one of the finest of a number of Magdalenian carvings in bone or antler of animals in the art of the Upper Paleolithic, though they are outnumbered by engraved pieces, which are sometimes classified as sculpture.[12] With the beginning of the Mesolithic in Europe figurative sculpture greatly reduced,[13] and remained a less common element in art than relief decoration of practical objects until the Roman period, despite some works such as the Gundestrup cauldron from the European Iron Age and the Bronze Age Trundholm sun chariot.[14]\n\nThe oldest European cave art dates back 40,800, and can be found in the El Castillo Cave in Spain.[15]  Other cave painting sites include Lascaux, Cave of Altamira, Grotte de Cussac, Pech Merle, Cave of Niaux, Chauvet Cave, Font-de-Gaume, Creswell Crags, Nottinghamshire, England, (Cave etchings and bas-reliefs discovered in 2003), Coliboaia cave from Romania (considered the oldest cave painting in central Europe)[16] and Magura,[4] Belogradchik, Bulgaria.[17]  Rock painting was also performed on cliff faces, but fewer of those have survived because of erosion.  One well-known example is the rock paintings of Astuvansalmi in the Saimaa area of Finland. When Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola first encountered the Magdalenian paintings of the Altamira cave, Cantabria, Spain in 1879, the academics of the time considered them hoaxes.  Recent reappraisals and numerous additional discoveries have since demonstrated their authenticity, while at the same time stimulating interest in the artistry of Upper Palaeolithic peoples.  Cave paintings, undertaken with only the most rudimentary tools, can also furnish valuable insight into the culture and beliefs of that era.\n\nThe Rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin represents a very different style, with the human figure the main focus, often seen in large groups, with battles, dancing and hunting all represented, as well as other activities and details such as clothing.  The figures are generally rather sketchily depicted in thin paint, with the relationships between the groups of humans and animals more carefully depicted than individual figures. Other less numerous groups of rock art, many engraved rather than painted, show similar characteristics. The Iberian examples are believed to date from a long period perhaps covering the Upper Paleolithic, Mesolithic and early Neolithic.\n\nPrehistoric Celtic art comes from much of Iron Age Europe and survives mainly in the form of high-status metalwork skillfully decorated with complex, elegant and mostly abstract designs, often using curving and spiral forms. There are human heads and some fully represented animals, but full-length human figures at any size are so rare that their absence may represent a religious taboo.  As the Romans conquered Celtic territories, it almost entirely vanishes, but the style continued in limited use in the British Isles, and with the coming of Christianity revived there in the Insular style of the Early Middle Ages.\n\nAncient\n\nMinoan\n\nThe Minoan civilization of Crete is regarded as the oldest civilization in Europe.[18] Minoan art is marked by imaginative images and exceptional workmanship.  Sinclair Hood described an \"essential quality of the finest Minoan art, the ability to create an atmosphere of movement and life although following a set of highly formal conventions\".[19]  It forms part of the wider grouping of Aegean art, and in later periods came for a time to have a dominant influence over Cycladic art.  Wood and textiles have decomposed, so most surviving examples of Minoan art are pottery, intricately-carved Minoan seals, .palace frescos which include landscapes), small sculptures in various materials, jewellery, and metalwork.\n\nThe relationship of Minoan art to that of other contemporary cultures and later Ancient Greek art has been much discussed.",

Visual art can be classified in diverse ways, such as separating fine arts from applied arts; inclusively focusing on human creativity; or focusing on different media such as architecture, sculpture, painting, film, photography, and graphic arts. In recent years, technological advances have led to video art, computer art, performance art, animation, television, and videogames.\n\nThe history of art is often told as a chronology of masterpieces created during each civilization. It can thus be framed as a story of high culture, epitomized by the Wonders of the World. On the other hand, vernacular art expressions can also be integrated into art historical narratives, referred to as folk arts or craft. The more closely that an art historian engages with these latter forms of low culture, the more likely it is that they will identify their work as examining visual culture or material culture, or as contributing to fields related to art history, such as anthropology or archaeology. In the latter cases, art objects may be referred to as archeological artifacts.\n\nPrehistory\n\nPrehistoric art includes a broad range of art made by painters and sculptors from illiterate cultures, including some of the earliest human artifacts. Among the first art objects are decorative artifacts from Middle Stone Age Africa.[1][2][3] Containers from that period have also been discovered in South Africa that may have been used to hold paints dating as far back as 100,000 years ago.[4]\n\nA form of prehistoric art found all over the world, especially in Europe, small prehistoric statuettes known as Venus figurines with exaggerated breasts and bellies were made, the most famous ones being the Venus of Hohle Fels and the Venus of Willendorf, found in Germany and Austria. Most have small heads, wide hips, and legs that taper to a point. Arms and feet are often absent, and the head is usually small and faceless.\n\nThe Venus of Hohle Fels is one of the numerous objects found at the Caves and Ice Age Art in the Swabian Jura UNESCO World Heritage Site, where the oldest non-stationary works of human art yet discovered were found, in the form of carved animal and humanoid figurines, in addition to the oldest musical instruments unearthed so far, with the artifacts dating between 43,000 and 35,000 BC.[5][6][7][8]\n\nThe best-known prehistoric artworks are the large Paleolithic cave paintings that depict animals in continental Europe, particularly the ones at Lascaux in the Dordogne region of France. Several hundred decorated caves are known, spanning the Upper Paleolithic period (c. 38,000–12,000 BC). There are examples in Ukraine, Italy and Great Britain, but most of them are in France and Spain. Many theories have been suggested about the art's purpose, the most accepted being that it was part of religious rituals, possibly to evoke hunting success.\n\nAntiquity\n\nAncient Near East\n\nAncient Near East stretched from Turkey and the Mediterranean seaboard in the west to Iran and the Arabian Peninsula in the east. Over time, multiple civilizations appeared, lived and disappeared here. One of the key regions was Mesopotamia, which witnessed during the 4th millennium BC the emergence of the first cities and the earliest form of writing. Ancient Mesopotamia covers present-day Iraq, and parts of Syria and Turkey. Its northern half forms part of the so-called Fertile Crescent, where important Neolithic developments such as early farming and the establishment of permanent village settlements first appeared. Because the region is situated within the Tigris–Euphrates river delta, numerous civilizations lived here, notably Sumer, Akkad, Assyria and Babylonia. Mesopotamian architecture was characterized by the use of bricks, lintels, and cone mosaic. Notable examples are the ziggurats, large temples in the form of step pyramids.\n\nThe political, economic, artistic and architectural traditions of the Sumerians lead to the foundation of Western civilization. Multiple things appeared for the first time in Sumer: the first city-state (Uruk), ruled by king Gilgamesh; the first organized religion, based on a hierarchical structure of gods, people and rituals; the first known writing, the cuneiforms; the first irrigation system and the first vehicles with wheels. Cylinder seals appeared here as well, engraved with little inscriptions and illustrations. Another civilization that developed here was the Akkadian Empire, the world's first great empire.\n\nDuring the early 1st millennium BC, after the Akkadians, an empire called Assyria came to dominate the whole of Middle East, stretching from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean Sea. Its cities were filled with impressive buildings and art. Assyrian art is best known for its detailed stone reliefs, depicting scenes of court life, religious practice, hunting and epic battles. These reliefs were initially painted in bright colours and placed in palaces. Besides their beauty, they also show us Assyrian life and views of the world, including Assyrian clothing and furniture.\n\nLater, the Babylonians conquered the Assyrian Empire. During the 6th century BC, Babylon became the largest city in the world. Upon entering Babylon, visitors were greeted with the impressive Ishtar Gate, with its walls covered in vivid blue glazed bricks and reliefs showing dragons, bulls and lions. This gate is named after Ishtar, the goddess of war and love.\n\nIn the mid-6th century BC, after a series of military campaigns, the Babylonian Empire fell to the Achaemenid Empire, ruled by King Cyrus II, stretching across the Middle East and Central Asia, from Egypt to the Indus Valley. Its art incorporates elements from across the empire, celebrating its wealth and power. Persepolis (Iran) was the capital of the empire, and it is full of impressive sculptures showing religious images and people of the empire. There are also the ruins of a palace here, with a big audience hall for receiving guests.\n\nBesides Mesopotamia and Iran, there were Ancient civilizations who produced art and architecture in other regions as well. In Anatolia (present-day Turkey), the Hittite Empire appeared. During Antiquity, South Arabia was important in the production and trade of aromatics, bringing wealth to the kingdoms that were in this region. Before circa 4000 BC, the climate of Arabia was wetter than today.",

The term art encompasses diverse media such as painting, sculpture, printmaking, drawing, decorative arts, photography, and installation.\n\n(Read Sister Wendy’s Britannica essay on art appreciation.)\n\nThe various visual arts exist within a continuum that ranges from purely aesthetic purposes at one end to purely utilitarian purposes at the other. Such a polarity of purpose is reflected in the commonly used terms artist and artisan, the latter understood as one who gives considerable attention to the utilitarian. This should by no means be taken as a rigid scheme, however. Even within one form of art, motives may vary widely; thus a potter or a weaver may create a highly functional work that is at the same time beautiful—a salad bowl, for example, or a blanket—or may create works that have no purpose beyond being admired. In cultures such as those of Africa and Oceania, a definition of art that encompasses this continuum has existed for centuries. In the West, however, by the mid-18th century the development of academies for painting and sculpture established a sense that these media were “art” and therefore separate from more utilitarian media. This separation of art forms continued among art institutions until the late 20th century, when such rigid distinctions began to be questioned.\n\nParticularly in the 20th century, a different sort of debate arose over the definition of art. A seminal moment in this discussion occurred in 1917, when Dada artist Marcel Duchamp submitted a porcelain urinal entitled Fountain to a public exhibition in New York City. Through this act, Duchamp put forth a new definition of what constitutes a work of art: he implied that it is enough for an artist to deem something “art” and put it in a publicly accepted venue. Implicit within this gesture was a challenge to the established art institutions—such as museums, exhibiting groups, and galleries—that have the power to determine what is and is not considered art. Such intellectual experimentation continued throughout the 20th century in movements such as conceptual art and minimalism. By the turn of the 21st century, a variety of new media (e.g., video art) further challenged traditional definitions of art.\n\nArt is treated in a number of articles. For general discussions of the foundations, principles, practice, and character of art, see aesthetics. See also art conservation and restoration.\n\nFor the technical and theoretical aspects of traditional categories of art, see drawing; painting; printmaking; sculpture. For technical and historical discussions of decorative arts and furnishings, see basketry; enamelwork; floral decoration; furniture; glassware; interior design; lacquerwork; metalwork; mosaic; pottery; rug and carpet; stained glass; tapestry. See photography for a complete history of that medium.\n\nFor treatments of the various arts as practiced by specific peoples and cultures, see, for example, African art; Central Asian arts; Egyptian art and architecture; Islamic arts; Oceanic art and architecture; South Asian arts.\n\n",

From queries about US politics to cricket in India, Wikipedia has become a source of information for millions of people across the globe.\n\nThe Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit that operates the site, released on Tuesday its annual list of the most-visited Wikipedia pages, showcasing what people wanted to read about this year.\n\nThe crowdsourced encyclopedia offers a snapshot of what topics captivate the public, become global trends or define a specific year, similar to Oxford’s word of the year. English-language Wikipedia was viewed over 76 billion times globally this year as of October, according to the Wikimedia Foundation.\n\n“The most popular Wikipedia articles are a reflection of our world, highlighting our collective interests at a unique moment in time,” Anusha Alikhan, the chief communications officer at the Wikimedia Foundation, said in a statement.\n\nA list of deaths in 2024 was the most visited page, garnering over 44 million views.\n\nA page about deaths in a given year has ranked at the top of the list five times since 2015, when the Wikimedia Foundation began releasing the data. The topic has never fallen below third place on the list.\n\nPeople also searched for US political figures, celebrities like Taylor Swift and popular American movies, as well as global sporting events and the general election in India. ChatGPT, which was the top visited article in 2023, fell in its ranking to the 12th most visited page.\n\nUS politics and pop culture dominated\n\nWikipedia’s most viewed pages of 2024 were largely related to US popular culture and politics.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and the 2024 US presidential election were second and third on the list with nearly 29 million and 28 million views, respectively. And the 2020 US presidential election was the 13th most-visited page with views doubling in November.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump came in at number five. He has been on the list almost every year since 2015, dropping off in 2022 and 2023 before reappearing this year. Vice President-elect JD Vance was in the top 10, coming in seventh.\n\nProject 2025 also got a place in the top 10, coming in ninth with nearly 20 million views.\n\nAlso in the top 25: Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a close Trump ally who’s been chosen to lead the incoming administration’s “Department of Government Efficiency,” President Joe Biden and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s pick for health secretary.\n\nA page about Tim Walz, the Democratic governor of Minnesota and vice-presidential candidate, did not appear in the top 25. But the data shows that he would have been 27th had the list been extended.\n\nWhile US politics was a notable search subject, popular culture had the largest share of the top 25.\n\nThe fourth most-visited page was about Lyle and Erik Menendez, the brothers who were sentenced to life in prison for the 1989 murder of their parents and are now facing a resentencing trial. The case received renewed public attention after a Netflix documentary was published this year. The Wikipedia page about the brothers received over 26 million views in 2024.\n\nThe “Deadpool & Wolverine” and “Dune: Part Two” movies were eighth and 23rd, respectively. In 2023, the movies “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” were in the top 25.\n\nGriselda Blanco, a Colombian drug trafficker known as the “Queen of Cocaine,” had a peak in views after a Netflix miniseries about her life was released this year, and her page received nearly 13.5 million views across the year.\n\nPeople also read up on celebrities throughout the year. Swift came in at 11th, down from ninth most-visited in 2023 when she first appeared on the list. The pop star completes her worldwide Eras Tour on December 8.\n\nSean “Diddy” Combs made the top 25, as the rapper and music producer faces more than 30 civil lawsuits that include charges of sexual trafficking and racketeering.\n\nAnd the page about Liam Payne, the One Direction musician who died on October 16, garnered over 12 million views. His death sparked an outpouring of grief from fans, drawing crowds that gathered at vigils around the world to mourn the British pop star.\n\nIndian politics and culture were also among top searches on Wikipedia.\n\n“Wikipedia readers in India continue to make a big impact on the list, a trend we saw in 2023 as well,” Wikimedia Foundation’s Alikhan said.\n\nThe Indian Premier League, a cricket league in India, garnered over 24.5 million views this year as the site’s sixth most visited page. The topic was the fourth most visited page in 2023, the first year it appeared on the list.\n\nThe Indian general election also made the top 10. In June, India Prime Minister Narendra Modi was reelected in the country’s general election. The page about the election saw a peak of 1.2 million views on June 4, when the voting results were announced, and gained over 18 million views during the year.\n\nBollywood movie “Kalki 2898 AD” saw 14.6 million views across the year, earning a spot in the top 25.

Alternative dispute resolution and arbitration have connections to business courts.\n\nContents\n\nDescription\n\nBusiness courts and commercial courts are specialized courts for cases involving commercial law, internal business disputes, and other matters affecting businesses.\n\nBusiness and commercial courts in the United States\n\nBusiness courts in the United States are trial courts that primarily or exclusively adjudicate internal business disputes and/or commercial litigation between businesses, heard before specialist judges assigned to these courts.[1][2] They have been established in approximately twenty-seven states. In some cases, a state legislature may choose to create a business court by statute. In other cases, business courts have been established by judicial rule or order, at the state supreme court or trial court level.[3] Georgia created a statewide business court by constitutional amendment.[4]\n\nTypes of jurisdictional models\n\nIn virtually all cases, the jurisdiction of the court to hear certain cases is limited to disputes that are in some way related to \"business\" or commercial disputes, and generally fall into two categories: (1) those courts which require that cases have an additional complexity component; and (2) those courts which establish jurisdictional parameters (i) through a defined list of case types (ii) combined with a specified minimum amount of damages in controversy, irrespective of complexity.[5]\n\nIn New York, for example, the trial level Supreme Court Commercial Division[6] follows the case type and jurisdictional amount in controversy model, giving jurisdiction over 12 listed business and commercial case categories while setting out monetary thresholds ranging from $50,000 in some counties to $500,000 in Manhattan.[7] The Massachusetts Superior Court's Business Litigation Session (BLS)[8] includes a jurisdictional list of case types, but instead of focusing on monetary thresholds as a gatekeeping mechanism, cases are included only where \"the BLS in the sound discretion of the BLS Administrative Justice, based principally on the complexity of the case and the need for substantial case management,\" selects a case for inclusion.[9]\n\nThere are mixed models as well, with some mandatory case type categories specifically listed, and other discretionary types requiring an element of complexity. The Maryland Circuit Court's Business and Technology Case Management Program includes certain \"presumptive\" mandatory case types, while others categories require a judge to more subjectively determine if they are complex enough to include on the docket.[10] North Carolina's Business Court[11] has a similar mixed model that makes jurisdiction mandatory if the listed commercial case type is over $5,000,000, but discretionary if under,[12] as well as a seldom used rule allowing judicial discretion.[13]\n\nHistory of business and commercial court creation and development\n\nThe modern creation of specialized Business Courts in the United States began in the early 1990s, and has expanded greatly in the last thirty years.[1][3] Business courts (which are often business programs or divisions within existing trial level courts) are operating (as of October 2024) in New York County/Manhattan, and 10 other jurisdictions throughout New York State as the New York Supreme Court Commercial Division, Chicago, North Carolina, New Jersey, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Reno and Las Vegas, Nevada, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Maryland, Orlando, Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, and Tampa, Florida, Michigan, Cincinnati, Cleveland and Toledo, Ohio, Iowa, Maine, New Hampshire, Metro Atlanta regionally and statewide via the Georgia State-wide Business Court, Delaware's Superior Court and Court of Chancery, Nashville, Tennessee, Indiana, Phoenix, Arizona, Kentucky, South Carolina, West Virginia, and Wyoming,[14] as well as Utah and Texas.\n\nIn 2023, Utah adopted legislation creating a statewide Business and Chancery Court, which became operational on October 1, 2024.[15][16] In 2023, Texas' governor signed legislation creating a trial level Business Court, and an appellate business court (that also hears disputes over the constitutionality of state statutes), the Fifteenth Court of Appeals. These courts have been open for cases since September 1, 2024.[17] In August 2024, the Texas Supreme Court rejected a constitutional challenge to the appellate business court's creation.[18]\n\nWhile Wisconsin still has the remnant of a business court as of October 2024, by a 4-3 vote its Supreme Court issued an order on October 7, 2024, ending the assignment of new cases to the commercial court pilot project, first established by that court in April 2017.[19]\n\nDelaware's Court of Chancery, the pre-eminent court addressing intra-business disputes, has functioned as a business court of limited jurisdiction for over a century.[20]  However, its traditional equity jurisdiction has evolved and expanded since 2003 to include technology disputes, some purely monetary commercial disputes, and to expand its role in the alternative dispute resolution of business and commercial disputes. This includes the use of mediation, Masters in Chancery to adjudicate matters, and agreements to make decisions non-appealable.[21]\n\nOther states have a mixed history. In New York,[22] Chicago,[23] Philadelphia,[24] Massachusetts,[25] North Carolina,[26] South Carolina,[27] and New Jersey,[28] among other locations with business courts, the original programs have expanded by adding judges and/or by expanding into additional cities and counties. Around 2000, Colorado's Supreme Court studied a business court, but did not pursue it,[29] and the Denver District Court later experimented for three years with a business court, known as the Civil Access Pilot Project.[30] Orlando's business court was restored in October 2019,[31] after an earlier funding shortage.[32]\n\nIn 2015, New Jersey's Supreme Court created a statewide Complex Business Litigation Program[33] after having only a few counties with business courts before that.[34] In 2009, Milwaukee's Circuit Court ended a little used business court program,[35] but Wisconsin's Supreme Court implemented a business court pilot program in 2017 which has expanded to a number of circuit courts and judicial districts,[36] which project has now been ended as of October 2024.[19] In May 2024, Oklahoma enacted a law creating a task force to study business courts.[37] The Hamilton County, Ohio Court of Common Pleas in Cincinnati discontinued its Commercial Docket in 2017, but revived it in 2024.",

Receiving $22 million in the process, Musk used $12 million of the proceedings to co-found the e-payment company X.com that same year. In 2000, X.com merged with the online bank Confinity and was rebranded as PayPal. In 2002, Musk received $176 million after PayPal acquired eBay as the companies largest shareholder, and would much later purchase the X.com domain from PayPal, with the intention of creating an \"everything app\". In 2004, with an investment of $6.3 million, Musk then became the chairman and majority shareholder of Tesla. In 2016, Musk co-founded the neurotechnology startup company Neuralink, with an investment of $100 million, followed by founding the Boring Company to construct tunnels. In 2022, Musk completed his acquisition of Twitter, becoming the CEO of Twitter, prior to its rebranding to X.\n\nBeginning with his involved with space exploration companies in early 2001, he founded SpaceX in 2002, with the company attempting the first rocket launch in 2006. Since 2019, SpaceX been developing Starship, a reusable, super heavy-lift launch vehicle, and in 2015, they began development of the Starlink for satellite Internet access. Having sent Starlink terminals to Ukraine in 2022, Musk refused to block Russian state media on Starlink and later faced criticism over denying access over Crimea.\n\nWith Tesla, he assumed leadership as CEO and product architect in 2008. In 2018, Musk was sued by the SEC for a tweet stating that funding had been secured for potentially taking Tesla private, later settling with the SEC, with Musk steping down as Tesla chairman while remaining its CEO. In 2023, shareholders filed a lawsuit, and a jury subsequently found Musk and Tesla not liable. As of 2019, Musk was the longest-tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally, and under the CEO, Tesla has also constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle factories, named Gigafactories.[1]\n\nZip2\n\nExternal videos\nMusk speaks of his early business experience during a 2014 commencement speech at University of Southern Californiaon YouTube\nIn 1995, Elon, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded Global Link Information Network, later renamed Zip2.[2][3] The company developed an Internet city guide with maps, directions, and yellow pages, and marketed it to newspapers.[4] They worked at a small rented office in Palo Alto,[5] with Musk coding the website every night.[5] Musk and his brother's immigration statuses during this period were described by Musk as a \"gray area\", although Kimbal maintained they were working as illegal immigrants.[6][7] A Washington Post exposé from October 2024 reported Musk worked illegally while building the company, citing an email from Musk submitted as evidence during a 2005 defamation trial and the funding agreement from venture capital firm Mohr Davidow Ventures.[8]\n\nEventually, Zip2 obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune.[9] The brothers persuaded the board of directors to abandon a merger with Citysearch;[10] however, Musk's attempts to become CEO were thwarted.[11] Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999,[12][13] and Musk received $22 million for his 7 percent share.[14]\n\nX.com and PayPal\n\nIn March 1999,[15] Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company with $12 million of the money he made from the Compaq acquisition.[16] X.com was one of the first online banks that was federally insured, and over 200,000 customers joined in its initial months of operation.[17]\n\nMusk's friends expressed skepticism about the naming of the online bank, fearing it might have been mistaken for a pornographic site. Musk brushed off their concerns, emphasizing that the name was meant to be straightforward, memorable, and easy to type. Additionally, he was fond of the email addresses derived from it, such as \"e@x.com\".[15] Although Musk founded the company, investors regarded him as inexperienced and replaced him with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year.[18]\n\nIn 2000, X.com merged with the online bank Confinity to avoid competition,[5][18][19] as the latter's money-transfer service PayPal was more popular than X.com's service.[20] Musk then returned as CEO of the merged company. His preference for Microsoft over Unix-based software caused a rift among the company's employees, and eventually led Confinity co-founder Peter Thiel to resign.[21] With the company suffering from compounding technological issues and the lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in September 2000.[22][a] Under Thiel, the company focused on the money-transfer service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.[24][25]\n\nIn 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk—PayPal's largest shareholder with 11.7% of shares—received $176 million.[26][27] In 2017, more than 15 years later, Musk purchased the X.com domain from PayPal for its \"sentimental value\".[28][29] In 2022, Musk discussed a goal of creating \"X, the everything app\".[30]\n\nSpaceX\n\nIn early 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and discussed funding plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars.[31] In October of the same year, he traveled to Moscow, Russia with Jim Cantrell, Adeo Ressi, and future Administrator of NASA, Michael D. Griffin[32] to buy refurbished intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into space. He met with the companies Lavochkin and ISC Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a novice[33] and the group returned to the United States without an agreement to purchase Russian launch services. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with ISC Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected. He instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets.[33] With $100 million of his own money,[34] Musk founded SpaceX in May 2002 and became the company's CEO and chief engineer.[35][36]\n\nSpaceX attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in 2006.[37] Although the rocket failed to reach Earth orbit, it was awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program contract from NASA, now led by Griffin as Administrator.",

      "raw_content": "Business-to-Business (B2B): What It Is and How It’s Used\n\nAriel Courage is an experienced editor, researcher, and former fact-checker. She has performed editing and fact-checking work for several leading finance publications, including The Motley Fool and Passport to Wall Street.\n\nWhat Is Business-to-Business (B2B)?\n\nBusiness-to-business (B2B), also called B-to-B, is a form of transaction between businesses such as a manufacturer and wholesaler or a wholesaler and a retailer. Business-to-business refers to commerce that's conducted between companies rather than companies and individual consumers.\n\nBusiness-to-business stands in contrast to business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-government (B2G) transactions.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nLara Antal / Investopedia\n\nUnderstanding Business-to-Business (B2B)\n\nBusiness-to-business transactions are common in a typical supply chain because companies must typically purchase components and raw materials for use in their manufacturing processes. Finished products can then be sold to individuals via business-to-consumer transactions.\n\nIn the context of communication, business-to-business refers to methods by which employees from different companies can connect through outlets such as social media. This type of communication between the employees of two or more companies is called B2B communication.\n\nB2B E-Commerce\n\nGrand View Research has reported that the B2B e-commerce market was estimated at $18,665.5 billion in 2023 and that it's expected to grow at a rate of about 18.2% annually from 2024 through 2030. It attributes the growth to rapid technology improvements.\n\nImportant\n\nThe Internet provides a robust environment in which businesses can find out about products and services and lay the groundwork for future business-to-business transactions.\n\nCompany websites allow interested parties to learn about a business's products and services and to initiate contact. Online product and supply exchange websites allow businesses to search for products and services and initiate procurement through e-procurement interfaces. Specialized online directories provide information about particular industries and companies and the products and services they provide. This also facilitates B2B transactions.\n\nSpecial Considerations\n\nSuccessful business-to-business transactions require planning. They rely on a company’s account management personnel to establish business-client relationships. Business-to-business relationships must also be nurtured for successful transactions to take place, typically through professional interactions before sales.\n\nTraditional marketing practices also help businesses connect with business clients. Trade publications aid in this effort, offering opportunities to advertise in print and online. A business’s presence at conferences and trade shows also builds awareness of its products and the services it provides to other businesses.\n\nExamples of Business-to-Business (B2B) Commerce\n\nBusiness-to-business transactions and large corporate accounts are commonplace for firms in manufacturing. Samsung is one of Apple's largest suppliers in the production of the iPhone. Apple also holds B2B relationships with firms like Intel, Panasonic, and semiconductor producer Micron Technology as of fiscal year 2022.\n\nB2B transactions are also the backbone of the automobile industry. Many vehicle components are manufactured independently and auto manufacturers purchase these parts to assemble automobiles. Tires, batteries, electronics, hoses, and door locks are typically manufactured by various companies and sold directly to automobile manufacturers.\n\nService providers also engage in B2B transactions. Companies specializing in property management, housekeeping, and industrial cleanup often sell these services exclusively to other businesses rather than to individual consumers.\n\nWhat Is the E-commerce Market?\n\nE-commerce includes all transactions that are accomplished from start to finish on the Internet. Products and services are purchased online and payments for products and services are also transmitted electronically. But this doesn't mean that a company can't also engage in brick-and-mortar transactions with customers or clients.\n\nWhat Are Some Common B2B Purchases?\n\nA retailer who purchases merchandise from manufacturers for resale to consumers has engaged in a B2B purchase but the purchases don't necessarily have to be resold. They can include software that's used for business purposes or shared business or office spaces.\n\nWhat Is a Business-to-Government (B2G) Transaction?\n\nA B2G transaction involves selling information, services, or products to a government. These are generally E-commerce exchanges but they're not limited to online activity. They're typically entered into under contract. A business submits bids and the government selects one of those bids and takes it to contract.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nB2B transactions usually occur between wholesalers and retailers. A wholesaler will sell products to a retailer and that retailer then places price tags on them and offers them to consumers for a profit. They can also involve a manufacturer purchasing necessary raw materials from a supplier to create a product that can eventually be sold to consumers. In any case, the cost generally trickles down to consumers.\n\nGrand View Research. \"Business-to-Business E-commerce Market Size Report, 2030.\"\n\nApple Inc. \"Supplier List.\"\n\nCoursera. \"What Is E-commerce?

Alongside the economical indicators (GDP) and Life Expectancy Index, it helps measure the educational attainment. GNI (PPP) per capita and life expectancy are also used with the education index to get the HDI of each country.\n\nSince 2010, the education index has been measured by combining average adult years of schooling with expected years of schooling for students under the age of 25, each receiving 50% weighting. Before 2010, the education index was measured by the adult literacy rate (with two-thirds weighting) and the combined primary, secondary, and tertiary gross enrollment ratio (with one-third weighting).\n\nEducation is a major component of well-being and is used in the measure of economic development and quality of life, which is a key factor determining whether a country is a developed, developing, or underdeveloped country.\n\nCalculations\n\nA country's education index is calculated with the following formula:[1]\n\nE\nI\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE\nY\nS\n\n18\n\n\n+\n\n\n\nM\nY\nS\n\n15\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle EI={\\frac {{\\frac {EYS}{18}}+{\\frac {MYS}{15}}}{2}}}\n\nEYS\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\textrm {EYS}}}\n\n, expected years of schooling, is a calculation of the number of years a student is expected to attend school, or university.

The approximate ratio of the total number of public schools to private schools in India is 10:3.[8]\n\nEducation in India covers different levels and types of learning, such as early childhood education, primary education, secondary education, higher education, and vocational education. It varies significantly according to different factors, such as location (urban or rural), gender, caste, religion, language, and disability.\n\nEducation in India faces several challenges, including improving access, quality, and learning outcomes, reducing dropout rates, and enhancing employability. It is shaped by national and state-level policies and programmes such as the National Education Policy 2020, Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan, Midday Meal Scheme, and Beti Bachao Beti Padhao. Various national and international stakeholders, including UNICEF, UNESCO, the World Bank, civil society organisations, academic institutions, and the private sector, contribute to the development of the education system.[9][10]\n\nEducation in India is plagued by issues such as grade inflation,[11] corruption, unaccredited institutions offering fraudulent credentials and lack of employment prospects for graduates.[12][13] Half of all graduates in India are considered unemployable.[14]\n\nThe foundation of English education in India can be traced back to colonial policies, notably Thomas Babington Macaulay's \"Minute on Indian Education\" in 1835. Macaulay advocated for creating a class of individuals who were Indian by birth but English in taste and intellect, aiming to serve as intermediaries between the British rulers and the Indian populace. This approach was designed to establish cultural dominance and facilitate administrative control. Post-independence, the continuation of English-medium education has often been seen as perpetuating the same hierarchical structures, subtly reinforcing Western cultural and ideological influence over Indian society. It has also been argued that this system restricts the independent and critical thinking abilities of Indians by promoting rote learning and foreign-centric worldviews.[15][16][17]\n\nIn contrast, countries such as Germany, known for its engineering expertise, France, recognized for its advancements in aviation, Japan, a global leader in technology, and China, an emerging hub of high-tech innovation, conduct education primarily in their respective native languages.Even in countries like the United States and the United Kingdom, where English is the native language, education is imparted in the mother tongue rather than adopting a foreign language. However, India continues to use foreign language English as the principal medium of instruction in higher education and professional domains.[18][19][20]\n\nEducation system\n\nUntil 1976, under the Indian constitution, each state was responsible for the schools that fell under its governance; states possessed full jurisdiction over creating and implementing education policies. After the 42nd Amendment of the Constitution of India was passed in 1976, education fell under the concurrent list,[21] which allowed the federal government (also known as the central government) to recommend education policies and programmes, even if state governments continued to wield extensive autonomy in implementing these programmes.[21] In a country as large as India, with 28 states and eight union territories, this has created vast differences between states' policies, plans, programmes, and initiatives relating to school education. Periodically, national policy frameworks are created to guide states in creating state-level programmes and policies. State governments and local government bodies manage the majority of primary and upper primary schools and the number of government-managed elementary schools is growing. Simultaneously, the number and proportion managed by private bodies is growing. In 2005–2006, 83.13% of schools offering elementary education (Grades 1–8) were managed by government, and 16.86% of schools were under private management (excluding children in unrecognised schools, schools established under the Education Guarantee Scheme and in alternative learning centres). Of those schools managed privately, one third are 'aided' and two thirds are 'unaided'. Enrolment in Grades 1–8 is shared between government and privately managed schools in the ratio 73:27. However, in rural areas this ratio is higher (80:20), and in urban areas much lower (36:66).[22]\n\nIn the 2011 Census, about 73% of the population was reported to be literate, with 81% for males and 65% for females. National Statistical Commission surveyed literacy to be 77.7% in 2017–18, 84.7% for males and 70.3% for females.[23] This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%, 53%, and 29%. In 1951 the rates were 18%, 27% and 9%.[24] India's improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic development.[25][26] Much of the progress, especially in higher education and scientific research, has been credited to various public institutions. While enrolment in higher education has increased steadily over the past decade, reaching a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of 26.3% in 2019,[27] there still remains a significant distance to catch up with tertiary education enrolment levels of developed nations,[28] a challenge that will be necessary to overcome in order to continue to reap a demographic dividend from India's comparatively young population.[citation needed]\n\nDemand for private schools has been growing over the years.[29]While a consensus over what is the most significant driver of this growth in private schooling has not yet emerged, some authors have attributed this to a higher demand for English-medium education[30], a dissatisfaction with the quality of public schools,[31][32] greater affordability of private schools,[29] and non-availability of the preferred field of study in government schools.[33] After the adoption of the Right to Education (RTE) Act 2009, private schools were required to be 'government-recognized'. A private school would be eligible for government recognition when it met certain conditions.[29]\n\nAt the primary and secondary level, India has a large private school system complementing the government-run schools, with 29% of students receiving private education in the 6 to 14 age group.[34] Certain post-secondary technical schools are also private. The private education market in India had a revenue of US$450  million in 2008, but is projected to be a US$40  billion market.[35]\n\nAs per the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2012, 96.",

Historical studies have included virtually every nation.[1][2][3] The earliest known formal school was developed in Egypt's Middle Kingdom under the direction of Kheti, treasurer to Mentuhotep II (2061-2010 BC). In ancient India, education was mainly imparted through the Vedic and Buddhist learning system, while the first education system in ancient China was created in Xia dynasty (2076–1600 BC). In the city-states of ancient Greece, most education was private, except in Sparta. For example, in Athens, during the 5th and 4th century BC, aside from two years military training, the state played little part in schooling. The first schools in Ancient Rome arose by the middle of the 4th century BC.\n\nIn Europe, during the Early Middle Ages, the monasteries of the Roman Catholic Church were the centers of education and literacy, preserving the Church's selection from Latin learning and maintaining the art of writing. In the Islamic civilization that spread all the way between China and Spain during the time between the 7th and 19th centuries, Muslims started schooling from 622 in Medina, which is now a city in Saudi Arabia, schooling at first was in the mosques (masjid in Arabic) but then schools became separate in schools next to mosques. Modern systems of education in Europe derive their origins from the schools of the High Middle Ages. Most schools during this era were founded upon religious principles with the primary purpose of training the clergy. Many of the earliest universities, such as the University of Paris founded in 1160, had a Christian basis. In addition to this, a number of secular universities existed, such as the University of Bologna, founded in 1088, the oldest university in continuous operation in the world, and the University of Naples Federico II (founded in 1224) in Italy, the world's oldest state-funded university in continuous operation.\n\nIn northern Europe this clerical education was largely superseded by forms of elementary schooling following the Reformation. Herbart developed a system of pedagogy widely used in German-speaking areas. Mass compulsory schooling started in Prussia by around 1800 to \"produce more soldiers and more obedient citizens\". After 1868 reformers set Japan on a rapid course of modernization, with a public education system like that of Western Europe. In Imperial Russia, according to the 1897 census, literate people made up 28 per cent of the population. There was a strong network of universities for the upper class, but weaker provisions for everyone else. Vladimir Lenin, in 1919 proclaimed the major aim of the Soviet government was the abolition of illiteracy. A system of universal compulsory education was established. Millions of illiterate adults were enrolled in special literacy schools.\n\nEducation in ancient civilization\n\nMiddle East\n\nThe earliest known formal school was developed in Egypt's Middle Kingdom under the direction of Kheti, treasurer to Mentuhotep II (2061-2010 BC).[4]\n\nIn Mesopotamia, the early logographic system of cuneiform script took many years to master. Thus only a limited number of individuals were hired as scribes to be train and writing. Only royal offspring and sons of the rich and professionals, such as scribes, physicians, and temple administrators, were schooled.[5] Most boys were taught their father's trade or were apprenticed to learn a trade.[6][page needed] Girls stayed at home with their mothers to learn housekeeping and cooking, and to look after the younger children. Later, when a syllabic script became more widespread, more of the Mesopotamian population became literate. Later still in Babylonian times there were libraries in most towns and temples; an old Sumerian proverb averred \"he who would excel in the school of the scribes must rise with the dawn.\"[citation needed] There arose a whole social class of scribes, mostly employed in agriculture, but some as personal secretaries or lawyers.[7] Women as well as men learned to read and write, and for the Semitic Babylonians, this involved knowledge of the extinct Sumerian language, and a complicated and extensive syllabary. Vocabularies, grammars, and interlinear translations were compiled for the use of students, as well as commentaries on the older texts and explanations of obscure words and phrases. Massive archives of texts were recovered from the archaeological contexts of Old Babylonian scribal schools known as edubas (2000–1600 BCE), through which literacy was disseminated. The Epic of Gilgamesh, an epic poem from Ancient Mesopotamia is among the earliest known works of literary fiction. The earliest Sumerian versions of the epic date from as early as the Third Dynasty of Ur (2150–2000 BC) (Dalley 1989: 41–42).\n\nAshurbanipal (685 – c. 627 BC), a king of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, was proud of his scribal education. His youthful scholarly pursuits included oil divination, mathematics, reading and writing as well as the usual horsemanship, hunting, chariotry, soldierliness, craftsmanship, and royal decorum. During his reign he collected cuneiform texts from all over Mesopotamia, and especially Babylonia, in the library in Nineveh, the first systematically organized library in the ancient Middle East,[8] which survives in part today.\n\nIn ancient Egypt, literacy was concentrated among an educated elite of scribes. Only people from certain backgrounds were allowed to train to become scribes, in the service of temple, pharaonic, and military authorities. The hieroglyph system was always difficult to learn, but in later centuries was purposely made even more so, as this preserved the scribes' status. Literacy remains an elusive subject for ancient Egypt.[9][10] Estimations of literacy range from 1 to 5 per cent of the population, based on very limited evidence[11][12][13][14] to much higher numbers.[15][16] Generalisations for the whole country, even at a given period, inevitably mask differences between regions, and, most importantly, between urban and rural populations. They may seriously underestimate the proportion of the population able to read and write in towns; low literacy estimates are a regular feature of 19th and 20th-century attitudes to ancient and medieval (pre-Reformation) societies.[12]\n\nIn ancient Israel, the Torah (the fundamental religious text) includes commands to read, learn, teach, and write the Torah, thus requiring literacy and study. In 64 AD the high priest caused schools to be opened.[17] Emphasis was placed on developing good memory skills in addition to comprehension oral repetition. For details of the subjects taught, see History of education in ancient Israel and Judah. Although girls were not provided with formal education in the yeshivah, they were required to know a large part of the subject areas to prepare them to maintain the home after marriage and educate the children before age seven. Despite this schooling system, it would seem that many children did not learn to read and write, because it has been estimated that \"at least ninety percent of the Jewish population of Roman Palestine [in the first centuries AD] could merely write their name or not write and read at all\",[18] or that the literacy rate was about 3 percent.[19]\n\nIndia\n\nIn ancient India, religious learning was mainly imparted through the Vedic and Buddhist religious learning systems. Sanskrit was the language used to impart the Sanskrit tradition. Pali was the language used in the Buddhist education system. In the Vedic system, a Brahman male started his religious at 8 to 12, whereas in the Buddhist system, the child started his education at the age of eight.",

      "raw_content": "Main Navigation\n\nWikipedia and education, globally\n\nFor more than a decade, Wiki Education has bridged the realms of education and Wikipedia, supporting academics and students in U.S. and Canadian accredited institutions as they improve the world’s go-to source of information. But what does this approach to enriching Wikipedia look like worldwide?\n\nLast month’s Speaker Series program, “Wikipedia and Education, globally”, explored this very question as our international panelists and attendees came together to examine the vast network of organizations and individual volunteers actively working at the intersection of Wikipedia and education.\n\nModerated by Wiki Education’s LiAnna Davis, the discussion featured program leaders from Nigeria, Argentina, Brazil, and Serbia, who shared histories of engaging students and instructors of all education levels with Wikipedia and offered insights on initiatives within their respective countries.\n\nWikimedia Serbia, one of the first groups in the Wikimedia movement to officially launch a Wikipedia and education program, collaborates with primary, secondary, and tertiary institutions to integrate Wikipedia into their curricula and enhance content on Wikipedia, Wikidata, and Wikibooks.\n\nThe perception of Wikipedia among educators in Serbia has evolved over time, noted panelist Nebojša Ratković of Wikimedia Serbia.\n\n“In earlier stages, Wikipedia was often viewed with skepticism by educators in Serbia,” said Ratković. “Over time, as Wikipedia’s quality control mechanisms improved and efforts were made to enhance the accuracy and reliability of its content, educators in Serbia began to recognize the value of Wikipedia as a learning tool.”\n\nRecognizing the shared experiences between the panelists, EduWiki Nigeria’s Bukola James echoed Ratković’s reflection on the evolution of educator perspectives surrounding Wikipedia.\n\n“Once [educators] get more familiar with how Wikipedia works, they begin to really appreciate it, in fact, they preach the gospel of using Wikipedia in the classroom to their colleagues,” said James. “Introducing Wikipedia to them isn’t really about them using [the site], but also about exposing them to different kinds of open education resources that could help support their teaching and student learning in their classrooms.”\n\nWikimedia Argentina also has a longstanding history of supporting educators, having trained thousands of teachers and university instructors in pedagogical approaches to incorporating Wikipedia into their classrooms.\n\n“Our turning point was during the pandemic,” explained panelist Luisina Ferrante of Wikimedia Argentina. “We were able to strengthen our networks with teachers and educational institutions, collaborate with public programs launched by the government in the context of the emergency, ally with public universities, and were more present than ever in designing open tools and resources.”\n\nAs the conversation turned to the future plans for each program, the four panelists considered the ever-changing political, educational, and technological landscapes in their respective countries.  Each speaker underscored the importance of continuing to serve as the connection between education and Wikipedia, noting the invaluable social impact of high-quality, open-access information.\n\n“When knowledge is limited to the walls of institutions, it fails to meet its objectives of contributing towards social improvement,” said Alexander Hilsenbeck Filho of Wiki Movimento Brasil. “It is important to disseminate knowledge and make it accessible to society so that it can be put to good use.”\n\nInterested in hearing more from our panelists and other scholars featured in previous webinars?

The discussion reflected the status of Wikipedia in the educational sector, especially in the academic institutions. As a Faculty member, I will say that Wikipedia is trickling in, in the courses with the students.\n\nHowever, many Faculty members are yet to accept it because of the conception of “not acceptable” for scholarly citation as anyone can edit. But then the developing is moving.\n\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

      "raw_content": "distance learning\n\nOur editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article.\n\ndistance learning,  form of education in which the main elements include physical separation of teachers and students during instruction and the use of various technologies to facilitate student-teacher and student-student communication. Distance learning traditionally has focused on nontraditional students, such as full-time workers, military personnel, and nonresidents or individuals in remote regions who are unable to attend classroom lectures. However, distance learning has become an established part of the educational world, with trends pointing to ongoing growth. In U.S. higher education alone, more than 5.6 million university students were enrolled in at least one online course in the autumn of 2009, up from 1.6 million in 2002. Students of all ages, around the world, were forced into distance learning in early 2020 once the global coronavirus pandemic resulted in the widespread closure of many schools. Videoconferencing software such as Zoom gained greatly from this development. Zoom became one of the most popular services of its kind, one of the most downloaded applications worldwide, and a household word. Teaching, and the student-teacher relationship, was fundamentally changed.\n\nAn increasing number of universities provide distance learning opportunities. A pioneer in the field is the University of Phoenix, which was founded in Arizona in 1976 and by the first decade of the 21st century had become the largest private school in the world, with more than 400,000 enrolled students. It was one of the earliest adopters of distance learning technology, although many of its students spend some time in classrooms on one of its dozens of campuses in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico. A precise figure for the international enrollment in distance learning is unavailable, but the enrollment at two of the largest public universities that heavily utilize distance learning methods gives some indication: in the early 21st century the Indira Gandhi National Open University, headquartered in New Delhi, had an enrollment in excess of 1.5 million students, and the China Central Radio and TV University, headquartered in Beijing, had more than 500,000 students.\n\nStudents and institutions embrace distance learning with good reason. Universities benefit by adding students without having to construct classrooms and housing, and students reap the advantages of being able to work where and when they choose. Public-school systems offer specialty courses such as small-enrollment languages and Advanced Placement classes without having to set up multiple classrooms. In addition, homeschooled students gain access to centralized instruction.\n\nCharacteristics of distance learning\n\nVarious terms have been used to describe the phenomenon of distance learning. Strictly speaking, distance learning (the student’s activity) and distance teaching (the teacher’s activity) together make up distance education. Common variations include e-learning or online learning, used when the Internet is the medium; virtual learning, which usually refers to courses taken outside a classroom by primary- or secondary-school pupils (and also typically using the Internet); correspondence education, the long-standing method in which individual instruction is conducted by mail; and open learning, the system common in Europe for learning through the “open” university (see below).\n\nFour characteristics distinguish distance learning. First, distance learning is by definition carried out through institutions; it is not self-study or a nonacademic learning environment. The institutions may or may not offer traditional classroom-based instruction as well, but they are eligible for accreditation by the same agencies as those employing traditional methods.\n\nSecond, geographic separation is inherent in distance learning, and time may also separate students and teachers. Accessibility and convenience are important advantages of this mode of education. Well-designed programs can also bridge intellectual, cultural, and social differences between students.\n\nThird, interactive telecommunications connect individuals within a learning group and with the teacher. Most often, electronic communications, such as e-mail, are used, but traditional forms of communication, such as the postal system, may also play a role. Whatever the medium, interaction is essential to distance education, as it is to any education. The connections of learners, teachers, and instructional resources become less dependent on physical proximity as communications systems become more sophisticated and widely available; consequently, the Internet, mobile phones, and e-mail have contributed to the rapid growth in distance learning.\n\nFinally, distance education, like any education, establishes a learning group, sometimes called a learning community, which is composed of students, a teacher, and instructional resources—i.e., the books, audio, video, and graphic displays that allow the student to access the content of instruction. Social networking on the Internet promotes the idea of community building. On sites such as Facebook and YouTube, users construct profiles, identify members (“friends”) with whom they share a connection, and build new communities of like-minded persons. In the distance learning setting, such networking can enable students’ connections with each other and thereby reduce their sense of isolation.\n\nEarly history of distance learning\n\nCorrespondence schools in the 19th century\n\nGeographical isolation from schools and dispersed religious congregations spurred the development of religious correspondence education in the United States in the 19th century. For example, the Chautauqua Lake Sunday School Assembly in western New York state began in 1874 as a program for training Sunday school teachers and church workers. From its religious origins, the program gradually expanded to include a nondenominational course of directed home reading and correspondence study. Its success led to the founding of many similar schools throughout the United States in the chautauqua movement.\n\nIt was the demand by industry, government, and the military for vocational training, however, that pushed distance learning to new levels. In Europe, mail-order courses had been established by the middle of the 19th century, when the Society of Modern Languages in Berlin offered correspondence courses in French, German, and English. In the United States, companies such as Strayer’s Business College of Baltimore City (now Strayer University), which was founded in Maryland in 1892 and included mail-order correspondence courses, were opened to serve the needs of business employers, especially in the training of women for secretarial duties. Most nonreligious mail-order correspondence courses emphasized instruction in spelling, grammar, business letter composition, and bookkeeping, but others taught everything from developing esoteric mental powers to operating a beauty salon. The clear leader in correspondence course instruction in American higher education at the end of the 19th century was the University of Chicago, where William Rainey Harper employed methods that he had used as director of the Chautauqua educational system for several years starting in 1883.\n\nEarly educational theories and technologies\n\nBehaviourism and constructivism\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, the use of educational technology in the United States was heavily influenced by two developing schools of educational philosophy. Behaviourism, led by the American psychologist John B. Watson and later by B.F. Skinner, discounted all subjective mental phenomena (e.g., emotions and mental images) in favour of objective and measurable behaviour.",

      "raw_content": "Engineering\n\n\n\nEngineering is systems and structures [1] designed by using natural science, mathematics, and the engineering design process[2] to solve problems within technology, increase efficiency and productivity, and improve already existing engineering systems. Modern engineering comprises many subfields which include designing and improving infrastructure, machinery, vehicles, electronics, materials, and energy systems.[3]\n\nThe discipline of engineering encompasses a broad range of more specialized fields of engineering, each with a more specific emphasis for applications of mathematics and science. See glossary of engineering.\n\nThe word engineering is derived from the Latin ingenium.[4]\n\nContents\n\nDefinition\n\nThe American Engineers' Council for Professional Development (the predecessor of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology aka ABET)[5] has defined \"engineering\" as:\n\nThe creative application of scientific principles to design or develop structures, machines, apparatus, or manufacturing processes, or works utilizing them singly or in combination; or to construct or operate the same with full cognizance of their design; or to forecast their behavior under specific operating conditions; all as respects an intended function, economics of operation and safety to life and property.[6][7]\n\nHistory\n\nEngineering has existed since ancient times, when humans devised inventions such as the wedge, lever, wheel and pulley, etc.\n\nThe term engineering is derived from the word engineer, which itself dates back to the 14th century when an engine'er (literally, one who builds or operates a siege engine) referred to \"a constructor of military engines\".[8] In this context, now obsolete, an \"engine\" referred to a military machine, i.e., a mechanical contraption used in war (for example, a catapult). Notable examples of the obsolete usage which have survived to the present day are military engineering corps, e.g., the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nThe word \"engine\" itself is of even older origin, ultimately deriving from the Latin ingenium (c. 1250), meaning \"innate quality, especially mental power, hence a clever invention.\"[9]\n\nLater, as the design of civilian structures, such as bridges and buildings, matured as a technical discipline, the term civil engineering[7] entered the lexicon as a way to distinguish between those specializing in the construction of such non-military projects and those involved in the discipline of military engineering.\n\nAncient era\n\nThe pyramids in ancient Egypt, ziggurats of Mesopotamia, the Acropolis and Parthenon in  Greece, the Roman aqueducts, Via Appia and Colosseum, Teotihuacán, and the Brihadeeswarar Temple of Thanjavur, among many others, stand as a testament to the ingenuity and skill of ancient civil and military engineers. Other monuments, no longer standing, such as the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and the Pharos of Alexandria, were important engineering achievements of their time and were considered among the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.\n\nThe six classic simple machines were known in the ancient Near East. The wedge and the inclined plane (ramp) were known since prehistoric times.[10] The wheel, along with the wheel and axle mechanism, was invented in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) during the 5th millennium BC.[11] The lever mechanism first appeared around 5,000 years ago in the Near East, where it was used in a simple balance scale,[12] and to move large objects in ancient Egyptian technology.[13] The lever was also used in the shadoof water-lifting device, the first crane machine, which appeared in Mesopotamia c. 3000 BC,[12] and then in ancient Egyptian technology c. 2000 BC.[14] The earliest evidence of pulleys date back to Mesopotamia in the early 2nd millennium BC,[15] and ancient Egypt during the Twelfth Dynasty (1991–1802 BC).[16] The screw, the last of the simple machines to be invented,[17] first appeared in Mesopotamia during the Neo-Assyrian period (911–609) BC.[15] The Egyptian pyramids were built using three of the six simple machines, the inclined plane, the wedge, and the lever, to create structures like the Great Pyramid of Giza.[18]\n\nThe earliest civil engineer known by name is Imhotep.[7] As one of the officials of the Pharaoh, Djosèr, he probably designed and supervised the construction of the Pyramid of Djoser (the Step Pyramid) at Saqqara in Egypt around 2630–2611 BC.[19] The earliest practical water-powered machines, the water wheel and watermill, first appeared in the Persian Empire, in what are now Iraq and Iran, by the early 4th century BC.[20]\n\nKush developed the Sakia during the 4th century BC, which relied on animal power instead of human energy.[21] Hafirs were developed as a type of reservoir in Kush to store and contain water as well as boost irrigation.[22] Sappers were employed to build causeways during military campaigns.[23] Kushite ancestors built speos during the Bronze Age between 3700 and 3250 BC.[24] Bloomeries and blast furnaces were also created during the 7th centuries BC in Kush.[25][26][27][28]\n\nAncient Greece developed machines in both civilian and military domains. The Antikythera mechanism, an early known mechanical analog computer,[29][30] and the mechanical inventions of Archimedes, are examples of Greek mechanical engineering. Some of Archimedes' inventions, as well as the Antikythera mechanism, required sophisticated knowledge of differential gearing or epicyclic gearing, two key principles in machine theory that helped design the gear trains of the Industrial Revolution, and are widely used in fields such as robotics and automotive engineering.[31]\n\nAncient Chinese, Greek, Roman and Hunnic armies employed military machines and inventions such as artillery which was developed by the Greeks around the 4th century BC,[32] the trireme, the ballista and the catapult, the trebuchet by Chinese circa 6th-5th century BCE.[33]\n\nMiddle Ages\n\nThe earliest practical wind-powered machines, the windmill and wind pump, first appeared in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age, in what are now Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, by the 9th century AD.[34][35][36][37] The earliest practical steam-powered machine was a steam jack driven by a steam turbine, described in 1551 by Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf in Ottoman Egypt.[38][39]\n\nThe cotton gin was invented in India by the 6th century AD,[40] and the spinning wheel was invented in the Islamic world by the early 11th century,[41] both of which were fundamental to the growth of the cotton industry. The spinning wheel was also a precursor to the spinning jenny, which was a key development during the early Industrial Revolution in the 18th century.[42]\n\nThe earliest programmable machines were developed in the Muslim world. A music sequencer, a programmable musical instrument, was the earliest type of programmable machine. The first music sequencer was an automated flute player invented by the Banu Musa brothers, described in their Book of Ingenious Devices, in the 9th century.[43][44] In 1206, Al-Jazari invented programmable automata/robots. He described four automaton musicians, including drummers operated by a programmable drum machine, where they could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns.[45]\n\nBefore the development of modern engineering, mathematics was used by artisans and craftsmen, such as millwrights, clockmakers, instrument makers and surveyors. Aside from these professions, universities were not believed to have had much practical significance to technology.[46]: 32\n\nA standard reference for the state of mechanical arts during the Renaissance is given in the mining engineering treatise De re metallica (1556), which also contains sections on geology, mining, and chemistry. De re metallica was the standard chemistry reference for the next 180 years.",

      "raw_content": "Electrical engineering\n\n\n\nElectrical engineering is an engineering discipline concerned with the study, design, and application of equipment, devices, and systems that use electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. It emerged as an identifiable occupation in the latter half of the 19th century after the commercialization of the electric telegraph, the telephone, and electrical power generation, distribution, and use.\n\nA long row ofdisconnectors\nOccupation\nNames | Electrical engineer\nActivity sectors | Electronics,electrical circuits,electromagnetics,power engineering,electrical machines,telecommunications,control systems,signal processing,optics,photonics, andelectrical substations\nDescription\nCompetencies | Technical knowledge, management skills, advanced mathematics, systems design, physics, science, abstract thinking, analytical thinking, philosophy of logic (see alsoGlossary of electrical and electronics engineering)\nFields ofemployment | Technology,science,exploration,military,industryandsociety\nElectrical engineering is divided into a wide range of different fields, including computer engineering, systems engineering, power engineering, telecommunications, radio-frequency engineering, signal processing, instrumentation, photovoltaic cells, electronics, and optics and photonics. Many of these disciplines overlap with other engineering branches, spanning a huge number of specializations including hardware engineering, power electronics, electromagnetics and waves, microwave engineering, nanotechnology, electrochemistry, renewable energies, mechatronics/control, and electrical materials science.[a]\n\nElectrical engineers typically hold a degree in electrical engineering, electronic or electrical and electronic engineering. Practicing engineers may have professional certification and be members of a professional body or an international standards organization. These include the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), the National Society of Professional Engineers (NSPE), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET, formerly the IEE).\n\nElectrical engineers work in a very wide range of industries and the skills required are likewise variable. These range from circuit theory to the management skills of a project manager. The tools and equipment that an individual engineer may need are similarly variable, ranging from a simple voltmeter to sophisticated design and manufacturing software.\n\nContents\n\nHistory\n\nElectricity has been a subject of scientific interest since at least the early 17th century. William Gilbert was a prominent early electrical scientist, and was the first to draw a clear distinction between magnetism and static electricity. He is credited with establishing the term \"electricity\".[1] He also designed the versorium: a device that detects the presence of statically charged objects. In 1762 Swedish professor Johan Wilcke invented a device later named electrophorus that produced a static electric charge.[2] By 1800 Alessandro Volta had developed the voltaic pile, a forerunner of the electric battery.\n\n19th century\n\nIn the 19th century, research into the subject started to intensify. Notable developments in this century include the work of Hans Christian Ørsted, who discovered in 1820 that an electric current produces a magnetic field that will deflect a compass needle; of William Sturgeon, who in 1825 invented the electromagnet; of Joseph Henry and Edward Davy, who invented the electrical relay in 1835; of Georg Ohm, who in 1827 quantified the relationship between the electric current and potential difference in a conductor; of Michael Faraday, the discoverer of electromagnetic induction in 1831; and of James Clerk Maxwell, who in 1873 published a unified theory of electricity and magnetism in his treatise Electricity and Magnetism.[3]\n\nIn 1782, Georges-Louis Le Sage developed and presented in Berlin probably the world's first form of electric telegraphy, using 24 different wires, one for each letter of the alphabet. This telegraph connected two rooms. It was an electrostatic telegraph that moved gold leaf through electrical conduction.\n\nIn 1795, Francisco Salva Campillo proposed an electrostatic telegraph system. Between 1803 and 1804, he worked on electrical telegraphy, and in 1804, he presented his report at the Royal Academy of Natural Sciences and Arts of Barcelona. Salva's electrolyte telegraph system was very innovative though it was greatly influenced by and based upon two discoveries made in Europe in 1800—Alessandro Volta's electric battery for generating an electric current and William Nicholson and Anthony Carlyle's electrolysis of water.[4] Electrical telegraphy may be considered the first example of electrical engineering.[5] Electrical engineering became a profession in the later 19th century.  Practitioners had created a global electric telegraph network, and the first professional electrical engineering institutions were founded in the UK and the US to support the new discipline. Francis Ronalds created an electric telegraph system in 1816 and documented his vision of how the world could be transformed by electricity.[6][7] Over 50 years later, he joined the new Society of Telegraph Engineers (soon to be renamed the Institution of Electrical Engineers) where he was regarded by other members as the first of their cohort.[8] By the end of the 19th century, the world had been forever changed by the rapid communication made possible by the engineering development of land-lines, submarine cables, and, from about 1890, wireless telegraphy.\n\nPractical applications and advances in such fields created an increasing need for standardized units of measure. They led to the international standardization of the units volt, ampere, coulomb, ohm, farad, and henry. This was achieved at an international conference in Chicago in 1893.[9] The publication of these standards formed the basis of future advances in standardization in various industries, and in many countries, the definitions were immediately recognized in relevant legislation.[10]\n\nDuring these years, the study of electricity was largely considered to be a subfield of physics since early electrical technology was considered electromechanical in nature. The Technische Universität Darmstadt founded the world's first department of electrical engineering in 1882 and introduced the first-degree course in electrical engineering in 1883.[11] The first electrical engineering degree program in the United States was started at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the physics department under Professor Charles Cross,[12] though it was Cornell University to produce the world's first electrical engineering graduates in 1885.[13] The first course in electrical engineering was taught in 1883 in Cornell's Sibley College of Mechanical Engineering and Mechanic Arts.[14]\n\nIn about 1885, Cornell President Andrew Dickson White established the first Department of Electrical Engineering in the United States.[15] In the same year, University College London founded the first chair of electrical engineering in Great Britain.[16] Professor Mendell P. Weinbach at University of Missouri established the electrical engineering department in 1886.[17] Afterwards, universities and institutes of technology gradually started to offer electrical engineering programs to their students all over the world.\n\nDuring these decades the use of electrical engineering increased dramatically. In 1882, Thomas Edison switched on the world's first large-scale electric power network that provided 110 volts—direct current (DC)—to 59 customers on Manhattan Island in New York City. In 1884, Sir Charles Parsons invented the steam turbine allowing for more efficient electric power generation.",

In Canada, a degree from a Canadian university can be accredited by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB). Alternatively, it might be accredited directly by another professional engineering institution, such as the US-based Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The Bachelor of Engineering contributes to the route to chartered engineer (UK), registered engineer or licensed professional engineer and has been approved by representatives of the profession. Similarly Bachelor of Engineering (BE) and Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in India is accredited by All India Council for Technical Education. Most universities in the United States and Europe award bachelor's degrees in engineering through various names.\n\nA less common and possibly the oldest variety of the degree in the English-speaking world is Baccalaureus in Arte Ingeniaria (B.A.I.), a Latin name meaning Bachelor in the Art of Engineering.[2] Here Baccalaureus in Arte Ingeniaria implies excellence in carrying out the 'art' or 'function' of an engineer. Some South African universities refer to their engineering degrees as B.Ing. (Baccalaureus Ingenieurswese, in Afrikaans).\n\nYouTube Encyclopedic\n\nTranscription\n\n\n\nEngineering fields\n\nA Bachelor of Engineering degree will usually be undertaken in one field of engineering, which is sometimes noted in the degree postnominals, as in B.E., B.AE. (Aero), or B.Eng (Elec). Common fields for the Bachelor of Engineering degree include the following fields:\n\nInternational variations\n\nAustralia\n\nIn Australia, the Bachelor of Engineering (BE or BEng - depending on the institution) is a four-year undergraduate degree course and a professional qualification.\n\nThe title of âengineerâ is not protected in Australia, therefore anyone can claim to be an engineer and practice without the necessary competencies, understanding of standards or in compliance with a code of ethics.[10] The industry has attempted to overcome the lack of title protection through chartership (CPEng), national registration (NER) and various state registration (RPEQ) programs which are usually obtained after a few years of professional practice.\n\nCanada\n\nIn Canada, degrees awarded for undergraduate engineering studies include the Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng. or B.E., depending on the institution); the BaccalaurÃ©at en gÃ©nie (B.Ing., the French equivalent of a B.Eng.; sometimes referred to as a BaccalaurÃ©at en ingÃ©nierie); the Bachelor of Applied Science (B.A.Sc.); and the Bachelor of Science in Engineering (B.Sc.Eng.).\n\nThe Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB), a division of the Engineers Canada, sets out and maintains the standards of accreditation among Canadian undergraduate engineering programs. Graduates of those programs are deemed by the profession to have the required academic qualifications to be licensed as professional engineers in Canada.[11] This practice is intended to maintain standards of education and allow mobility of engineers in different provinces of Canada.[12]\n\nA CEAB-accredited degree is the minimum academic requirement for registration as a professional engineer anywhere in the country and the standard against which all other engineering academic qualifications are measured.[13] Graduation from an accredited program, which normally involves four years of study, is a required first step to becoming a professional engineer. Regulation and accreditation are accomplished through a self-governing body (the name of which varies from province to province), which is given the power by statute to register and discipline engineers, as well as regulate the field of engineering in the individual provinces.\n\nGraduates of non-CEAB-accredited programs must demonstrate that their education is at least equivalent to that of a graduate of a CEAB-accredited program.[13]\n\nNigeria\n\nIn Nigeria, the Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng) is a five year undergraduate professional degree course.\n\nThe title of \"Engineer\" or \"Engr\" is protected in Nigeria, making it impossible for any one to be addressed officially as one, if not a certified engineer.\n\nCertification comes with registration and accreditation by Council for the Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria (COREN). It is the regulatory body that governs the practice of engineering in Nigeria.[14]\n\nThe membership is required to practice engineering independently. It is a requirement for some engineering firms and is mandatory for government contracts.",

      "raw_content": "engineering\n\nOur editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article.\n\nengineering,  the application of science to the optimum conversion of the resources of nature to the uses of humankind. The field has been defined by the Engineers Council for Professional Development, in the United States, as the creative application of “scientific principles to design or develop structures, machines, apparatus, or manufacturing processes, or works utilizing them singly or in combination; or to construct or operate the same with full cognizance of their design; or to forecast their behaviour under specific operating conditions; all as respects an intended function, economics of operation and safety to life and property.” The term engineering is sometimes more loosely defined, especially in Great Britain, as the manufacture or assembly of engines, machine tools, and machine parts.\n\nThe words engine and ingenious are derived from the same Latin root, ingenerare, which means “to create.” The early English verb engine meant “to contrive.” Thus, the engines of war were devices such as catapults, floating bridges, and assault towers; their designer was the “engine-er,” or military engineer. The counterpart of the military engineer was the civil engineer, who applied essentially the same knowledge and skills to designing buildings, streets, water supplies, sewage systems, and other projects.\n\nAssociated with engineering is a great body of special knowledge; preparation for professional practice involves extensive training in the application of that knowledge. Standards of engineering practice are maintained through the efforts of professional societies, usually organized on a national or regional basis, with all members acknowledging a responsibility to the public over and above responsibilities to their employers or to other members of their society.\n\nThe function of the scientist is to know, while that of the engineer is to do. Scientists add to the store of verified systematized knowledge of the physical world, and engineers bring this knowledge to bear on practical problems. Engineering is based principally on physics, chemistry, and mathematics and their extensions into materials science, solid and fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, transfer and rate processes, and systems analysis.\n\nUnlike scientists, engineers are not free to select the problems that interest them. They must solve problems as they arise, and their solutions must satisfy conflicting requirements. Usually, efficiency costs money, safety adds to complexity, and improved performance increases weight. The engineering solution is the optimum solution, the end result that, taking many factors into account, is most desirable. It may be the most reliable within a given weight limit, the simplest that will satisfy certain safety requirements, or the most efficient for a given cost. In many engineering problems the social and environmental costs are significant.\n\nEngineers employ two types of natural resources—materials and energy. Materials are useful because of their properties: their strength, ease of fabrication, lightness, or durability; their ability to insulate or conduct; their chemical, electrical, or acoustical properties. Important sources of energy include fossil fuels (coal, petroleum, natural gas), wind, sunlight, falling water, and nuclear fission. Since most resources are limited, engineers must concern themselves with the continual development of new resources as well as the efficient utilization of existing ones.\n\nHistory of engineering\n\nThe first engineer known by name and achievement is Imhotep, builder of the Step Pyramid at Ṣaqqārah, Egypt, probably about 2550 bce. Imhotep’s successors—Egyptian, Persian, Greek, and Roman—carried civil engineering to remarkable heights on the basis of empirical methods aided by arithmetic, geometry, and a smattering of physical science. The Pharos (lighthouse) of Alexandria, Solomon’s Temple in Jerusalem, the Colosseum in Rome, the Persian and Roman road systems, the Pont du Gard aqueduct in France, and many other large structures, some of which endure to this day, testify to their skill, imagination, and daring. Of many treatises written by them, one in particular survives to provide a picture of engineering education and practice in classical times: Vitruvius’s De architectura, published in Rome in the 1st century ce, a 10-volume work covering building materials, construction methods, hydraulics, measurement, and town planning.\n\nIn construction, medieval European engineers carried technique, in the form of the Gothic arch and flying buttress, to a height unknown to the Romans. The sketchbook of the 13th-century French engineer Villard de Honnecourt reveals a wide knowledge of mathematics, geometry, natural and physical science, and draftsmanship.\n\nIn Asia, engineering had a separate but very similar development, with more and more sophisticated techniques of construction, hydraulics, and metallurgy helping to create advanced civilizations such as the Mongol empire, whose large, beautiful cities impressed Marco Polo in the 13th century.\n\nCivil engineering emerged as a separate discipline in the 18th century, when the first professional societies and schools of engineering were founded. Civil engineers of the 19th century built structures of all kinds, designed water-supply and sanitation systems, laid out railroad and highway networks, and planned cities. England and Scotland were the birthplace of mechanical engineering, as a derivation of the inventions of the Scottish engineer James Watt and the textile machinists of the Industrial Revolution. The development of the British machine-tool industry gave tremendous impetus to the study of mechanical engineering both in Britain and abroad.\n\nThe growth of knowledge of electricity—from Alessandro Volta’s original electric cell of 1800 through the experiments of Michael Faraday and others, culminating in 1872 in the Gramme dynamo and electric motor (named after the Belgian Zénobe-Théophile Gramme)—led to the development of electrical and electronics engineering. The electronics aspect became prominent through the work of such scientists as James Clerk Maxwell of Britain and Heinrich Hertz of Germany in the late 19th century. Major advances came with the development of the vacuum tube by Lee de Forest of the United States in the early 20th century and the invention of the transistor in the mid-20th century. In the late 20th century electrical and electronics engineers outnumbered all others in the world.\n\nChemical engineering grew out of the 19th-century proliferation of industrial processes involving chemical reactions in metallurgy, food, textiles, and many other areas. By 1880 the use of chemicals in manufacturing had created an industry whose function was the mass production of chemicals. The design and operation of the plants of this industry became a function of the chemical engineer.\n\nIn the late 20th and early 21st centuries the field of environmental engineering expanded to address global warming and sustainability. The development and deployment of renewable energy, such as solar and wind power, the creation of new technologies for carbon sequestration and pollution control, and the design of green architecture and environmentally friendly urban planning are all recent developments.\n\nEngineering functions\n\nProblem solving is common to all engineering work. The problem may involve quantitative or qualitative factors; it may be physical or economic; it may require abstract mathematics or common sense. Of great importance is the process of creative synthesis or design, putting ideas together to create a new and optimum solution.\n\nAlthough engineering problems vary in scope and complexity, the same general approach is applicable. First comes an analysis of the situation and a preliminary decision on a plan of attack.",

In these contexts, the capital letters and the small letters represent distinct and unrelated entities. Those Greek letters which have the same form as Latin letters are rarely used: capital A, B, E, Z, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, T, Y, X. Small ι, ο and υ are also rarely used, since they closely resemble the Latin letters i, o and u. Sometimes, font variants of Greek letters are used as distinct symbols in mathematics, in particular for ε/ϵ and π/ϖ. The archaic letter digamma (Ϝ/ϝ/ϛ) is sometimes used.\n\nThe Bayer designation naming scheme for stars typically uses the first Greek letter, α, for the brightest star in each constellation, and runs through the alphabet before switching to Latin letters.\n\nIn mathematical finance, the Greeks are the variables denoted by Greek letters used to describe the risk of certain investments.\n\nTypography\n\nSome common conventions:\n\nThe Greek letter forms used in mathematics are often different from those used in Greek-language text: they are designed to be used in isolation, not connected to other letters, and some use variant forms which are not normally used in current Greek typography.\n\nThe OpenType font format has the feature tag \"mgrk\" (\"Mathematical Greek\") to identify a glyph as representing a Greek letter to be used in mathematical (as opposed to Greek language) contexts.\n\nThe table below shows a comparison of Greek letters rendered in TeX and HTML.\nThe font used in the TeX rendering is an italic style. This is in line with the convention that variables should be italicized. As Greek letters are more often than not used as variables in mathematical formulas, a Greek letter appearing similar to the TeX rendering is more likely to be encountered in works involving mathematics.\n\nName | TeX | HTML\nAlpha | Aα{\\displaystyle \\mathrm {A} \\,\\alpha } | Α α\nBeta | Bβ{\\displaystyle \\mathrm {B} \\,\\beta } | Β β\nGamma | Γγ{\\displaystyle \\Gamma \\,\\gamma } | Γ γ\nDelta | Δδ{\\displaystyle \\Delta \\,\\delta } | Δ δ\nEpsilon | Eϵε{\\displaystyle \\mathrm {E} \\,\\epsilon \\,\\varepsilon } | Ε ϵ ε\nDigamma | Ϝϝ{\\displaystyle \\mathrm {\\Digamma} \\,\\digamma } | Ϝ ϝ\nZeta | Zζ{\\displaystyle \\mathrm {Z} \\,\\zeta } | Ζ ζ\nEta | Hη{\\displaystyle \\mathrm {H} \\,\\eta } | Η η\nTheta | Θθϑ{\\displaystyle \\Theta \\,\\theta \\,\\vartheta } | Θ θ ϑ\nIota | Iι{\\displaystyle \\mathrm {I} \\,\\iota } | Ι ι\nKappa | Kκϰ{\\displaystyle \\mathrm {K} \\,\\kappa \\,\\varkappa } | Κ κ ϰ\nLambda | Λλ{\\displaystyle \\Lambda \\,\\lambda } | Λ λ\nMu | Mμ{\\displaystyle \\mathrm {M} \\,\\mu } | Μ μ\nName | TeX | HTML\nNu | Nν{\\displaystyle \\mathrm {N} \\,\\nu } | Ν ν\nXi | Ξξ{\\displaystyle \\Xi \\,\\xi } | Ξ ξ\nOmicron | Oo{\\displaystyle \\mathrm {O} \\,o} | Ο ο\nPi | Ππϖ{\\displaystyle \\Pi \\,\\pi \\,\\varpi } | Π π ϖ\nRho | Pρϱ{\\displaystyle \\mathrm {P} \\,\\rho \\,\\varrho } | Ρ ρ ϱ\nSigma | Σσς{\\displaystyle \\Sigma \\,\\sigma \\,\\varsigma } | Σ σ ς\nTau | Tτ{\\displaystyle \\mathrm {T} \\,\\tau } | Τ τ\nUpsilon | Υυ{\\displaystyle \\Upsilon \\,\\upsilon } | Υ υ\nPhi | Φϕφ{\\displaystyle \\Phi \\,\\phi \\,\\varphi } | Φ ϕ φ\nChi | Xχ{\\displaystyle \\mathrm {X} \\,\\chi } | Χ χ\nPsi | Ψψ{\\displaystyle \\Psi \\,\\psi } | Ψ ψ\nOmega | Ωω{\\displaystyle \\Omega \\,\\omega } | Ω ω\nName | Greek Letter | Bold | Italic | Bold Italic | Sans-Serif Bold | Sans-Serif Bold Italic | APL | Double struck bold | Unicode variants or similar\nAlpha | Α α | 𝚨 𝛂 | 𝛢 𝛼 | 𝜜 𝜶 | 𝝖 𝝰 | 𝞐 𝞪 | ⍺ ⍶ |  | \nBeta | Β β ϐ ᵝ ᵦ | 𝚩 𝛃 | 𝛣 𝛽 | 𝜝 𝜷 | 𝝗 𝝱 | 𝞑 𝞫 |  |  | \nGamma | Γ γ ᴦ ᵞ ᵧ | 𝚪 𝛄 | 𝛤 𝛾 | 𝜞 𝜸 | 𝝘 𝝲 | 𝞒 𝞬 |  | ℾ ℽ | \nDelta | Δ δ ᵟ | 𝚫 𝛅 | 𝛥 𝛿 | 𝜟 𝜹 | 𝝙 𝝳 | 𝞓 𝞭 |  |  | U+2206∆INCREMENT,U+2207∇NABLA\nEpsilon | Ε ε ϵ ϶ | 𝚬 𝛆 𝛜 | 𝛦 𝜀 𝜖 | 𝜠 𝜺 𝝐 | 𝝚 𝝴 𝞊 | 𝞔 𝞮 𝟄 | ⍷ |  | U+2208∈ELEMENT OF–U+220D∍SMALL CONTAINS AS MEMBER\nZeta | Ζ ζ | 𝚭 𝛇 | 𝛧 𝜁 | 𝜡 𝜻 | 𝝛 𝝵 | 𝞕 𝞯 |  |  | \nEta | Η η Ͱ ͱ | 𝚮 𝛈 | 𝛨 𝜂 | 𝜢 𝜼 | 𝝜 𝝶 | 𝞖 𝞰 |  |  | \nTheta | Θ θ ϑ ϴ ᶿ | 𝚯 𝛉 𝚹 𝛝 | 𝛩 𝜃 𝛳 𝜗 | 𝜣 𝜽 𝜭 𝝑 | 𝝝 𝝷 𝚹 𝞋 | 𝞗 𝞱 𝜭 𝟅 |  |  | \nIota | Ι ι ᶥ ℩ | 𝚰 𝛊 | 𝛪 𝜄 | 𝜤 𝜾 | 𝝞 𝝸 | 𝞘 𝞲 | ⍳ ⍸ |  | \nKappa | Κ κ ϰ | 𝚱 𝛋 𝛞 | 𝛫 𝜅 𝜘 | 𝜥 𝜿 𝝒 | 𝝟 𝝹 𝞌 | 𝞙 𝞳 𝟆 |  |  | \nLambda | Λ λ ᴧ | 𝚲 𝛌 | 𝛬 𝜆 | 𝜦 𝝀 | 𝝠 𝝺 | 𝞚 𝞴 |  |  | \nMu | Μ μ | 𝚳 𝛍 | 𝛭 𝜇 | 𝜧 𝝁 | 𝝡 𝝻 | 𝞛 𝞵 |  |  | \nNu | Ν ν | 𝚴 𝛎 | 𝛮 𝜈 | 𝜨 𝝂 | 𝝢 𝝼 | 𝞜 𝞶 |  |  | \nXi | Ξ ξ | 𝚵 𝛏 | 𝛯 𝜉 | 𝜩 𝝃 | 𝝣 𝝽 | 𝞝 𝞷 |  |  | \nOmicron | Ο ο | 𝚶 𝛐 | 𝛰 𝜊 | 𝜪 𝝄 | 𝝤 𝝾 | 𝞞 𝞸 |  |  | \nPi | Π π ϖ ᴨ | 𝚷 𝛑 𝛡 | 𝛱 𝜋 𝜛 | 𝜫 𝝅 𝝕 | 𝝥 𝝿 𝞏 | 𝞟 𝞹 𝟉 |  | ℿ ℼ | U+220F∏N-ARY PRODUCT,U+2210∐N-ARY COPRODUCT\nRho | Ρ ρ Ῥ ῥ ῤ ϱ ϼ ᴩ ᵨ ☧ | 𝚸 𝛒 𝛠 | 𝛲 𝜌 𝜚 | 𝜬 𝝆 𝝔 | 𝝦 𝞀 𝞎 | 𝞠 𝞺 𝟈 | ⍴ |  | \nSigma | Σ σ ς Ϲ ϲ Ͻ  ͻ Ͼ ͼ Ͽ ͽ | 𝚺 𝛔 𝛓 | 𝛴 𝜎 𝜍 | 𝜮 𝝈 𝝇 | 𝝨 𝞂 𝞁 | 𝞢 𝞼 𝞻 |  | ⅀ | U+2211∑N-ARY SUMMATION\nTau | Τ τ | 𝚻 𝛕 | 𝛵 𝜏 | 𝜯 𝝉 | 𝝩 𝞃 | 𝞣 𝞽 |  |  | \nUpsilon | Υ υ ϒ | 𝚼 𝛖 | 𝛶 𝜐 | 𝜰 𝝊 | 𝝪 𝞄 | 𝞤 𝞾 |  |  | \nPhi | Φ φ ϕ | 𝚽 𝛗 𝛟 | 𝛷 𝜑 𝜙 | 𝜱 𝝋 𝝓 | 𝝫 𝞅 𝞍 | 𝞥 𝞿 𝟇 |  |  | \nChi | Χ χᵡᵪ☧ | 𝚾 𝛘 | 𝛸 𝜒 | 𝜲 𝝌 | 𝝬 𝞆 | 𝞦 𝟀 |  |  | \nPsi | Ψ ψ ᴪ | 𝚿 𝛙 | 𝛹 𝜓 | 𝜳 𝝍 | 𝝭 𝞇 | 𝞧 𝟁 |  |  | \nOmega | Ω ω ꭥ | 𝛀 𝛚 | 𝛺 𝜔 | 𝜴 𝝎 | 𝝮 𝞈 | 𝞨 𝟂 | ⍵ ⍹ |  | U+2126ΩOHM SIGN,U+2127℧INVERTED OHM SIGN\nConcepts represented by a Greek letter\n\nΑα (alpha)\n\nΒβ (beta)\n\nΓγ (gamma)\n\nΔδ (delta)\n\nΕε (epsilon)\n\nϜϝ (digamma)\n\nΖζ (zeta)\n\nΗη (eta)\n\nΘθ (theta)\n\nΙι (iota)\n\nΚκ (kappa)\n\nΛλ (lambda)\n\nΜμ (mu)\n\nΝν (nu)\n\nΞξ (xi)\n\nΟο (omicron)\n\nΠπ (pi)\n\nΡρ (rho)\n\nΣσς (sigma)\n\nΤτ (tau)\n\nϒυ (upsilon)\n\nΦφ (phi)\n\nNote: The empty set symbol ∅ looks similar, but is unrelated to the Greek letter.",

      "raw_content": "electrical and electronics engineering\n\nOur editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article.\n\nWhat is electrical and electronics engineering?\n\nElectrical and electronics engineering is the branch of engineering concerned with practical applications of electricity in all its forms. Electronics engineering is the branch of electrical engineering which deals with the uses of the electromagnetic spectrum and the application of such electronic devices as integrated circuits and transistors.\n\nWhen did electrical engineering emerge as a discipline?\n\nElectrical engineering may be said to have emerged as a discipline in 1864 when the Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell summarized the basic laws of electricity in mathematical form and showed that radiation of electromagnetic energy travels through space at the speed of light.\n\nWhat was the first practical application of electrical engineering?\n\nThe first practical application of electrical engineering was the telegraph, invented by Samuel F.B. Morse in 1837.\n\nWhat kind of research is done in electrical and electronics engineering?\n\nThe research functions of electrical and electronics engineering include basic research in physics and other sciences, applied research, design of devices, equipment, and systems for manufacture, field-testing, the establishment of quality control standards, supervision of manufacture and production testing, and engineering management.\n\nelectrical and electronics engineering,  the branch of engineering concerned with the practical applications of electricity in all its forms, including those of the field of electronics. Electronics engineering is that branch of electrical engineering concerned with the uses of the electromagnetic spectrum and with the application of such electronic devices as integrated circuits and transistors.\n\nIn engineering practice, the distinction between electrical engineering and electronics is usually based on the comparative strength of the electric currents used. In this sense, electrical engineering is the branch dealing with “heavy current”—that is, electric light and power systems and apparatuses—whereas electronics engineering deals with such “light current” applications as telephone and radio communication, computers, radar, and automatic control systems.\n\nThe distinction between the fields has become less sharp with technical progress. For example, in the high-voltage transmission of electric power, large arrays of electronic devices are used to convert transmission-line current at power levels in the tens of megawatts. Moreover, in the regulation and control of interconnected power systems, electronic computers are used to compute requirements much more rapidly and accurately than is possible by manual methods.\n\nHistory\n\nElectrical phenomena attracted the attention of European thinkers as early as the 17th century. The most noteworthy pioneers include Ludwig Wilhelm Gilbert and Georg Simon Ohm of Germany, Hans Christian Ørsted of Denmark, André-Marie Ampère of France, Alessandro Volta of Italy, Joseph Henry of the United States, and Michael Faraday of England. Electrical engineering may be said to have emerged as a discipline in 1864 when the Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell summarized the basic laws of electricity in mathematical form and showed that radiation of electromagnetic energy travels through space at the speed of light. Thus, light itself was shown to be an electromagnetic wave, and Maxwell predicted that such waves could be artificially produced. In 1887 the German physicist Heinrich Hertz fulfilled Maxwell’s prediction by experimentally producing radio waves.\n\nThe first practical application of electricity was the telegraph, invented by Samuel F.B. Morse in 1837. The need for electrical engineers was not felt until some 40 years later, upon the invention of the telephone (1876) by Alexander Graham Bell and of the incandescent lamp (1878) by Thomas A. Edison. These devices and Edison’s first central generating plant, in New York City (1882), created a large demand for people trained to work with electricity.\n\nThe discovery of thermionic emission, or the “Edison effect,” a flow of current through the vacuum of one of his lamps, was the first observation of current in space. Hendrik Antoon Lorentz of the Netherlands postulated the electron theory of electrical charge in 1892, and in 1897 J.J. Thomson of England showed that thermionic emission was indeed caused by negatively charged particles (electrons). This led to the work of Guglielmo Marconi of Italy, Lee de Forest of the United States, and many others, which laid the foundations of radio engineering. In 1930 the term electronics was introduced to embrace radio and the industrial applications of electron tubes. Since 1947, when the transistor was invented by John Bardeen, Walter H. Brattain, and William B. Shockley, electronics engineering has been dominated by the applications of such solid-state electronic devices as the transistor, the semiconductor diode, and the integrated circuit.\n\nElectrical and electronics engineering functions\n\nResearch\n\nThe functions performed by electrical and electronics engineers include (1) basic research in physics, other sciences, and applied mathematics in order to extend knowledge applicable to the field of electronics, (2) applied research based on the findings of basic research and directed at discovering new applications and principles of operation, (3) development of new materials, devices, assemblies, and systems suitable for existing or proposed product lines, (4) design of devices, equipment, and systems for manufacture, (5) field-testing of equipment and systems, (6) establishment of quality control standards to be observed in manufacture, (7) supervision of manufacture and production testing, (8) postproduction assessment of performance, maintenance, and repair, and (9) engineering management, or the direction of research, development, engineering, manufacture, and marketing and sales.\n\nConsulting\n\nThe rapid proliferation of new discoveries, products, and markets in the electrical and electronics industries has made it difficult for workers in the field to maintain the range of skills required to manage their activities. Consulting engineers, specializing in new fields, are employed to study and recommend courses of action.\n\nThe educational background required for these functions tends to be highest in basic and applied research. In most major laboratories a doctorate in science or engineering is required to fill leadership roles. Most positions in design, product development, and supervision of manufacture and quality control require a master’s degree. In the high-technology industries typical of modern electronics, an engineering background at not less than the bachelor’s level is required to assess competitive factors in sales engineering to guide marketing strategy.\n\nBranches of electrical and electronics engineering\n\nThe largest of the specialized branches of electrical engineering, the branch concerned with the electronic computer, was introduced during World War II. The field of computer science and engineering has attracted members of several disciplines outside electronics, notably logicians, linguists, and applied mathematicians.\n\nAnother very large field is that concerned with electric light and power and their applications. Specialities within the field include the design, manufacture, and use of turbines, generators, transmission lines, transformers, motors, lighting systems, and appliances.\n\nA third major field is that of communications, which comprises not only telephony but also satellite communications and the transmission of voice and data by laser signals through optical-fibre networks.",

The concept of health takes into account physical, psychological, and social well-being, among other factors.[4]\n\nPublic health is an interdisciplinary field. For example, epidemiology, biostatistics, social sciences and management of health services are all relevant. Other important sub-fields include environmental health, community health, behavioral health, health economics, public policy, mental health, health education, health politics, occupational safety, disability, oral health, gender issues in health, and sexual and reproductive health.[5] Public health, together with primary care, secondary care, and tertiary care, is part of a country's overall healthcare system. Public health is implemented through the surveillance of cases and health indicators, and through the promotion of healthy behaviors. Common public health initiatives include promotion of hand-washing and breastfeeding, delivery of vaccinations, promoting ventilation and improved air quality both indoors and outdoors, suicide prevention, smoking cessation, obesity education, increasing healthcare accessibility and distribution of condoms to control the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nThere is a significant disparity in access to health care and public health initiatives between developed countries and developing countries, as well as within developing countries. In developing countries, public health infrastructures are still forming. There may not be enough trained healthcare workers, monetary resources, or, in some cases, sufficient knowledge to provide even a basic level of medical care and disease prevention.[6][7] A major public health concern in developing countries is poor maternal and child health, exacerbated by malnutrition and poverty coupled with governments' reluctance in implementing public health policies. Developed nations are at greater risk of certain public health crises, including childhood obesity, although overweight populations in low- and middle-income countries are catching up.[8]\n\nFrom the beginnings of human civilization, communities promoted health and fought disease at the population level.[9][10] In complex, pre-industrialized societies, interventions designed to reduce health risks could be the initiative of different stakeholders, such as army generals, the clergy or rulers. Great Britain became a leader in the development of public health initiatives, beginning in the 19th century, due to the fact that it was the first modern urban nation worldwide.[11] The public health initiatives that began to emerge initially focused on sanitation (for example, the Liverpool and London sewerage systems), control of infectious diseases (including vaccination and quarantine) and an evolving infrastructure of various sciences, e.g. statistics, microbiology, epidemiology, sciences of engineering.[11]\n\nDefinition\n\nPublic health has been defined as \"the science and art of preventing disease\", prolonging life and improving quality of life through organized efforts and informed choices of society, organizations (public and private), communities and individuals.[2]  The public can be as small as a handful of people or as large as a village or an entire city. The concept of health takes into account physical, psychological, and social well-being. As such, according to the World Health Organization, \"health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\".[4]\n\nRelated terms\n\nPublic health is related to global health which is the health of populations in the worldwide context.[12] It has been defined as \"the area of study, research and practice that places a priority on improving health and achieving equity in \"Health for all\" people worldwide\".[13] International health is a field of health care, usually with a public health emphasis, dealing with health across regional or national boundaries.[14] Public health is not the same as public healthcare (publicly funded health care).\n\nThe term preventive medicine is related to public health. The American Board of Preventive Medicine separates three categories of preventive medicine: aerospace health, occupational health, and public health and general preventative medicine. Jung, Boris and Lushniak argue that preventive medicine should be considered the medical specialty for public health but note that the American College of Preventive Medicine and American Board of Preventive Medicine do not prominently use the term \"public health\".[15]: 1  Preventive medicine specialists are trained as clinicians and address complex health needs of a population such as by assessing the need for disease prevention programs, using the best methods to implement them, and assessing their effectiveness.[15]: 1, 3\n\nSince the 1990s many scholars in public health have been using the term population health.[16]: 3  There are no medical specialties directly related to population health.[15]: 4  Valles argues that consideration of health equity is a fundamental part of population health. Scholars such as Coggon and Pielke express concerns about bringing general issues of wealth distribution into population health. Pielke worries about \"stealth issue advocacy\" in population health.[16]: 163  Jung, Boris and Lushniak consider population health to be a concept that is the goal of an activity called public health practiced through the specialty preventive medicine.[15]: 4\n\nLifestyle medicine uses individual lifestyle modification to prevent or revert disease and can be considered a component of preventive medicine and public health. It is implemented as part of primary care rather than a specialty in its own right.[15]: 3  Valles argues that the term social medicine has a narrower and more biomedical focus than the term population health.[16]: 7\n\nPurpose\n\nThe purpose of a public health intervention is to prevent and mitigate diseases, injuries, and other health conditions. The overall goal is to improve the health of individuals and populations, and to increase life expectancy.[17][18]\n\nComponents\n\nPublic health is a complex term, composed of many elements and different practices. It is a multi-faceted, interdisciplinary field.[11] For example, epidemiology, biostatistics, social sciences and management of health services are all relevant. Other important sub-fields include environmental health, community health, behavioral health, health economics, public policy, mental health, health education, health politics, occupational safety, disability, gender issues in health, and sexual and reproductive health.[5]\n\nModern public health practice requires multidisciplinary teams of public health workers and professionals.",

      "raw_content": "Contents\n\nHealth informatics\n\n\nMedicalinformaticsintroducesinformation processingconcepts and machinery to the domain ofmedicine.\n\n\nHealth informatics combines communications, information technology (IT), and health care to enhance patient care and is at the forefront of the medical technological revolution.[1] It can be viewed as a branch of engineering and applied science.\n\nThe health domain provides an extremely wide variety of problems that can be tackled using computational techniques.[2]\n\nHealth informatics is a spectrum of multidisciplinary fields that includes study of the design, development, and application of computational innovations to improve health care.[3] The disciplines involved combine healthcare fields with computing fields, in particular computer engineering, software engineering, information engineering, bioinformatics, bio-inspired computing, theoretical computer science, information systems, data science, information technology, autonomic computing, and behavior informatics.[4]\n\nIn the healthcare industry, health informatics has provided such technological solutions as telemedicine, surgical robots, electronic health records (EHR), Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS), and decision support, artificial intelligence, and machine learning innovations including IBM's Watson and Google's DeepMind platform.\n\nIn academic institutions, health informatics includes research focuses on applications of artificial intelligence in healthcare and designing medical devices based on embedded systems.[2] In some countries the term informatics is also used in the context of applying library science to data management in hospitals where it aims to develop methods and technologies for the acquisition, processing, and study of patient data,[5] An umbrella term of biomedical informatics has been proposed.[6]\n\nSubject areas\n\nDutch former professor of medical informatics Jan van Bemmel has described medical informatics as the theoretical and practical aspects of information processing and communication based on knowledge and experience derived from processes in medicine and health care.[2]\n\nThe Faculty of Clinical Informatics has identified six high level domains of core competency for clinical informaticians:[7]\n\nTools to support practitioners\n\nClinical informaticians use their knowledge of patient care combined with their understanding of informatics concepts, methods, and health informatics tools to:\n\nClinicians collaborate with other health care and information technology professionals to develop health informatics tools which promote patient care that is safe, efficient, effective, timely, patient-centered, and equitable. Many clinical informaticists are also computer scientists.\n\nTelehealth and telemedicine\n\nTelehealth is the distribution of health-related services and information via electronic information and telecommunication technologies. It allows long-distance patient and clinician contact, care, advice, reminders, education, intervention, monitoring, and remote admissions. Telemedicine is sometimes used as a synonym, or is used in a more limited sense to describe remote clinical services, such as diagnosis and monitoring. Remote monitoring, also known as self-monitoring or testing, enables medical professionals to monitor a patient remotely using various technological devices. This method is primarily used for managing chronic diseases or specific conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes mellitus, or asthma.\n\nThese services can provide comparable health outcomes to traditional in-person patient encounters, supply greater satisfaction to patients, and may be cost-effective.[8] Telerehabilitation (or e-rehabilitation[40][41]) is the delivery of rehabilitation services over telecommunications networks and the Internet. Most types of services fall into two categories: clinical assessment (the patient's functional abilities in his or her environment), and clinical therapy. Some fields of rehabilitation practice that have explored telerehabilitation are: neuropsychology, speech-language pathology, audiology, occupational therapy, and physical therapy. Telerehabilitation can deliver therapy to people who cannot travel to a clinic because the patient has a disability or because of travel time. Telerehabilitation also allows experts in rehabilitation to engage in a clinical consultation at a distance.\n\nDecision support, artificial intelligence and machine learning in healthcare\n\nA pioneer in the use of artificial intelligence in healthcare was American biomedical informatician Edward H. Shortliffe. This field deals with utilization of machine-learning algorithms and artificial intelligence, to emulate human cognition in the analysis, interpretation, and comprehension of complicated medical and healthcare data. Specifically, AI is the ability of computer algorithms to approximate conclusions based solely on input data. AI programs are applied to practices such as diagnosis processes, treatment protocol development, drug development, personalized medicine, and patient monitoring and care. A large part of industry focus of implementation of AI in the healthcare sector is in the clinical decision support systems.\n\nAs more data is collected, machine learning algorithms adapt and allow for more robust responses and solutions.[9] Numerous companies are exploring the possibilities of the incorporation of big data in the healthcare industry. Many companies investigate the market opportunities through the realms of \"data assessment, storage, management, and analysis technologies\" which are all crucial parts of the healthcare industry.[10] The following are examples of large companies that have contributed to AI algorithms for use in healthcare:\n\nDigital consultant apps like Babylon Health's GP at Hand, Ada Health, Alibaba Health Doctor You, KareXpert and Your.MD use AI to give medical consultation based on personal medical history and common medical knowledge. Users report their symptoms into the app, which uses speech recognition to compare against a database of illnesses. Babylon then offers a recommended action, taking into account the user's medical history. Entrepreneurs in healthcare have been effectively using seven business model archetypes to take AI solution[buzzword] to the marketplace. These archetypes depend on the value generated for the target user (e.g. patient focus vs. healthcare provider and payer focus) and value capturing mechanisms (e.g. providing information or connecting stakeholders). IFlytek launched a service robot \"Xiao Man\", which integrated artificial intelligence technology to identify the registered customer and provide personalized recommendations in medical areas.\n\nIt also works in the field of medical imaging. Similar robots are also being made by companies such as UBTECH (\"Cruzr\") and Softbank Robotics (\"Pepper\"). The Indian startup Haptik recently developed a WhatsApp chatbot which answers questions associated with the deadly coronavirus in India. With the market for AI expanding constantly, large tech companies such as Apple, Google, Amazon, and Baidu all have their own AI research divisions, as well as millions of dollars allocated for acquisition of smaller AI based companies.[10] Many automobile manufacturers are beginning to use machine learning healthcare in their cars as well.[10] Companies such as BMW, GE, Tesla, Toyota, and Volvo all have new research campaigns to find ways of learning a driver's vital statistics to ensure they are awake, paying attention to the road, and not under the influence of substances or in emotional distress.[10] Examples of projects in computational health informatics include the COACH project.[12][13]\n\nClinical Research Informatics\n\nClinical research informatics (CRI) is a sub-field of health informatics that tries to improve the efficiency of clinical research by using informatics methods.",

      "raw_content": "Epic Systems: Wizards won’t modernize health care, and Wikipedia pages don’t edit themselves.\n\nA little over three years ago Oracle bought Cerner Corporation sending shockwaves through the Electronic Health Records (EHR) market, particularly market-leader Epic Systems. Oracle jumped into this market because we understand that doctors and patients need modern technology, not Hogwarts and Wizards. We focused on securing the health care system from illicit actors. We set on a path to build a modern EHR Cloud, focused on innovation while Epic built a yellow brick road to nowhere. At Epic, product demos were replaced by campus tours, reserve your spot here. And Oracle embraced interoperability, so clinicians were not shackled to a walled garden in Verona, Wisconsin.\n\nEpic’s response should be to out-innovate, out-invest, and beat Oracle to the cloud and AI in EHRs. Instead, it appears Epic was busy orchestrating another kind of campaign from its tree house in the sky. Consumed with a highly curated image machine, Epic CEO Judy Faulkner focused more on self-accolades than products, which is apparent based on her consuming focus on editing the Epic Wikipedia page (something which, btw, violates Wikipedia’s rules).\n\nBut she didn’t stop there. It appears Epic Systems not only curated its own image, but stealthily turned its PR machine on Seema Verma, Executive Vice President and General Manager at Oracle Health and Life Sciences. Ms. Verma is the head of Oracle Health and therefore the commercial peer to Epic CEO Judy Faulkner. Rather than out-innovate her competitors, Ms. Faulkner turned her magic wand on a bit of a smear campaign against her biggest rival.\n\nThere’s a non-fiction “backstory” to Ms. Faulkner and Ms. Verma’s relationship (it’s kind of like Wicked™, so Ms. Faulkner can follow along). Ms. Faulkner vehemently opposed Ms. Verma’s push for EHR interoperability while Ms. Verma served as Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.1 Ms. Verma proposed rules around interoperability and data sharing that were starkly at odds with Epic’s corporate interests which are to protect Epic’s dominant position.2 Efforts to kill interoperability and Ms. Verma’s proposals were led by Epic’s chief lobbyist Ladd Wiley.3\n\nMs. Faulkner, it turns out, is for her own flavor of interoperability. She loves interoperability so long as it means everything interoperates around Epic Systems. Real, open, interoperable systems, not so much. Watch what she does, not what she says.\n\nAnd because opposing interoperability is like rooting against Hermione Granger, it appears Ms. Faulkner has been coordinating a deliberate behind-the-scenes campaign to disparage Ms. Verma. This campaign, orchestrated through sophisticated, anonymous editing of Wikipedia pages, has focused on discrediting Ms. Verma and damaging her reputation as she transitioned into her role leading Oracle Health.\n\nThe campaign against Ms. Verma began in earnest on January 29, 2021, with a spree of Wikipedia edits aimed at introducing misleading and damaging information about her. We couldn’t help but notice how interesting it was that neutral Wikipedia editors seemed so focused on only positive edits to the Epic Systems Wikipedia page and suddenly there’s a barrage of sophisticated, negative edits to Ms. Verma’s page.\n\nIt took this author less than a week to figure out what was going on using little more than the internet and public audit logs. Turns out the edits to Ms. Verma’s page originated from a static IP address managed by the Washington Airports Authority, suggesting the editor deliberately exploited a public Wi-Fi network to mask their identity. Over the course of seven edits, the anonymous user systematically introduced only negative claims about Ms. Verma’s professional reputation. These edits were so transparently biased and unfounded that many were reversed by neutral Wikipedia moderators.\n\nThe editor demonstrated a working knowledge of internal personnel dynamics within the Department of Health and Human Services. Beyond the attacks on Ms. Verma, the same editor made a single, seemingly innocuous edit to the Wikipedia page of former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, adding the name of his first deputy, who had recently joined Akin Gump’s healthcare lobbying practice.\n\nAkin Gump is a law firm where Epic Systems’ head of government affairs, Ladd Wiley, worked for over twelve years. Mr. Wiley himself has a long track record of well-documented lobbying activities at HHS and CMS. By or about 2021, Ladd Wiley joined Epic Systems as Head of Public Policy. At the time Mr. Wiley joined Epic Systems, the defamatory attacks against Ms. Verma evolved into a more sophisticated, coordinated, and sustained effort—indicative of a professionally funded campaign to harm Ms. Verma’s reputation.\n\nThe editing patterns of Ms. Verma’s page became increasingly systematic and calculated, employing a narrative designed to undermine Ms. Verma’s credibility and professional standing. The linguistic patterns, timing, and content focus across these edits are unmistakably consistent, leaving little doubt that this was a deliberate effort to undermine Ms. Verma’s professional standing by the same person or group of persons.\n\nA significant and troubling escalation occurred in December 2023 when Ms. Verma’s Wikipedia page was locked for editing by anonymous IP addresses due to repeated edits aimed at discrediting her.\n\nImmediately following the lock, a new Wikipedia user, “Lacassal,” emerged and resumed making edits nearly identical in tone, style, and content to those previously made by the anonymous IP addresses during the preceding two and half years. The linguistic similarities, including repeated phrases and distinct stylistic choices, strongly suggest that the same individual or coordinated group was responsible for both sets of edits.\n\nSo, we wondered, what or who in the world is a “Lacassal”? A quick review of the user “Lacassal” reveals compelling evidence linking the account to Eric D. Hargan, former Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and his lobbying and public affairs firm, The Hargan Group.\n\nLacassal’s edits demonstrated an intimate familiarity with Ms. Verma’s tenure at CMS, including obscure details and internal matters that would not be readily known to casual editors or the general public. Interestingly the only positive edit made by “Lacassal” during this period was to Mr. Hargan’s own Wikipedia page, where “Lacassal” added “Hargan Strategies” to his employment history.\n\n“Lacassal” appears to stand for Lac ‘Assal, or Lake Assal in Djibouti Africa, an area intimately familiar to Mr. Hargan for its outbreak of COVID impacting the U.S. military’s Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa, which Mr. Hargan worked on while Deputy Secretary of HHS.\n\nAuthor’s Note: We acknowledge it is possible that an independent, neutral Wikipedia editor not associated with Mr. Hargan (or not Mr. Hargan) edited both Ms. Verma’s page and the page of Hargan Strategies (and nothing else) and is also familiar (as is Mr. Hargan) with a lake in central-western Djibouti.\n\nThe connection between Mr. Hargan and Epic Systems provides further evidence of coordination. As a former Deputy Secretary of HHS, Mr. Hargan has deep and longstanding ties to Epic Systems and its key figures, particularly Mr. Wiley. Mr. Hargan and Mr. Wiley have known each other for at least 15 years, having co-founded the Coalition to Protect Patient Rights (CPPR) in 2009. CPPR, a nonprofit to influence healthcare policy, worked extensively to oppose the Affordable Care Act through so-called “astroturfing” campaigns and other public relations efforts.\n\nIn October 2020, Mr. Hargan visited the Epic Systems headquarters in Wisconsin to meet with senior leadership, including Ms. Faulkner, to discuss health information systems and data interoperability—critical topics for Epic’s market position.",

In contrast, in countries with more equality browsing was more expansive and covered a wider diversity or topics,” says first author Dale Zhou. “While the exact reasons for why this is occurring are not fully clear, we have some strong hunches, and we believe these findings will prove useful in helping scientists in our field better understand the nature of curiosity across different cultures and locations globally.”\n\nThis work builds on a previous study led by assistant professor in the Annenberg School for Communication David Lydon-Staley, who was a postdoctoral researcher in Bassett’s Complex Systems Lab at the time.\n\nIn that paper, the team had 149 participants from Philadelphia browse Wikipedia for 15 minutes a day for 21 days. In the course of that study, they identified the two curiosity styles, which were predicted by Perry Zurn, one of the new paper’s coauthors and a professor of philosophy at American University and currently a visiting professor at Cornell University, who studied and analyzed literature from over the last two millennia to home in those these styles of curiosity.\n\n“Beginning this line of work in a small sample allowed us to work out the methods needed to capture the complex information-seeking that accompanies curiosity,” Lydon-Staley says. “Working out those methods then allowed us to scale up and ask whether we could confirm that the styles we observed could be found outside of our sample of Philadelphians.”\n\nWorking with Martin Gerlach of the Wikimedia Foundation, who had data of more than two million human browsers, “allowed us to apply our existing methods, and develop new methods, to capture styles of curiosity emerging across 14 different languages of Wikipedia and 50 different countries or territories,” Lydon-Staley says.\n\nThe three hunches\n\nThe researchers cite three main hypotheses driving the associations between information-seeking approaches and equality.\n\n“One is that it’s possible that countries that have more inequality also have more patriarchal structures of oppression that are constraining the knowledge production approaches to be more Hunter-like,” says Bassett. “Countries that have greater equality, in contrast, are open to a diversity of ideas, and therefore a diversity of ways that we’re engaging in the world. This is more like the busybody—the one that’s moving between ideas in a very open-minded way.”\n\nA second possibility the researchers outline is that browsers go to Wikipedia for different purposes in different countries, citing how someone in a country with higher equality may be going to the site for entertainment or leisure rather than for work.\n\nAnd the third potential explanation is that people in different countries who come to Wikipedia may have different ages, genders, socioeconomic status, or educational attainment, and that those differences in who’s actually coming to Wikipedia may explain the differences in the browsing patterns.\n\nMaking connections\n\nOne of the most exciting findings of the study was the confirmation of a third curiosity style—the “dancer,” which had previously only been hypothesized based on Zurn’s research on historical texts.\n\n“The dancer is someone who moves along a track of information but, unlike the busybody, they make leaps between ideas in a creative, choreographed way,” says Zurn. “They don’t jump randomly; they connect different domains to create something new.”\n\nThis curiosity style shows a degree of creativity and interdisciplinary thinking, offering a new perspective on how people engage with information. “It’s less about randomness and more about seeing connections where others might not,” Bassett says.\n\n“What this tells us is that people—and likely children—have different curiosity styles, and that might affect how they approach learning,” Bassett says. “A child with a hunter-like curiosity may struggle if assessed using methods that favor the busybody style, or vice versa. Understanding these styles could help us tailor educational experiences to better support individual learning paths.”\n\nWhere curiosity may lead next\n\nLooking ahead, the team seeks to explore the factors influencing these curiosity styles.\n\n“One question I’m particularly interested in is whether people browse differently at different times of day—perhaps they’re more hunter-like in the morning and more like busybodies in the evening,” says Bassett.\n\n“This opens up new research avenues, including the role of biological processes in shaping how we seek information,” says Shubhankar Patankar, another author on the paper and a doctoral student in Penn Engineering. He is also keen to understand the implications of the work for AI. “Imparting notions of curiosity to AI systems learning from interactions is an increasingly important area of research,” Patankar says.\n\nThe team aims to explore the motivations behind Wikipedia browsing, examining whether users are driven by extrinsic factors, like work, or intrinsic curiosity, like personal interest. Additionally, they are considering expanding their analysis to include other digital platforms where learning and exploration naturally occur.\n\n“Wikipedia is a very special place on the internet,” Lydon-Staley says. “The site features exclusively free content and no commercial advertisements. Much of the rest of the contemporary digital landscape is designed to activate individuals’ buying impulses and customizes our media content. This raises the question of how much we are in charge of where our curiosity takes us in online contexts beyond Wikipedia.”\n\nDani S. Bassett is the J.

As a group of educational disciplines, the humanities are distinguished in content and method from the physical and biological sciences and, somewhat less decisively, from the social sciences. The humanities include the study of all languages and literatures, the arts, history, and philosophy. The humanities are sometimes organized as a school or administrative division in many colleges and universities in the United States.\n\nThe modern conception of the humanities has its origin in the Classical Greek paideia, a course of general education dating from the Sophists in the mid-5th century bce, which prepared young men for active citizenship in the polis, or city-state; and in Cicero’s humanitas (literally, “human nature”), a program of training proper for orators, first set forth in De oratore (Of the Orator) in 55 bce. In the early Middle Ages the Church Fathers, including St. Augustine, himself a rhetorician, adapted paideia and humanitas—or the bonae (“good”), or liberales (“liberal”), arts, as they were also called—to a program of basic Christian education; mathematics, linguistic and philological studies, and some history, philosophy, and science were included.\n\nThe word humanitas, although not the substance of its component disciplines, dropped out of common use in the later Middle Ages but underwent a flowering and a transformation in the Renaissance. The term studia humanitatis (“studies of humanity”) was used by 15th-century Italian humanists to denote secular literary and scholarly activities (in grammar, rhetoric, poetry, history, moral philosophy, and ancient Greek and Latin studies) that the humanists thought to be essentially humane and Classical studies rather than divine ones. In the 18th century, Denis Diderot and the French Encyclopédistes censured studia humanitatis for what they claimed had by then become its dry, exclusive concentration on Latin and Greek texts and language. By the 19th century, when the purview of the humanities expanded, the humanities had begun to take their identity not so much from their separation from the realm of the divine as from their exclusion of the material and methods of the maturing physical sciences, which tended to examine the world and its phenomena objectively, without reference to human meaning and purpose.\n\nContemporary conceptions of the humanities resemble earlier conceptions in that they propose a complete educational program based on the propagation of a self-sufficient system of human values. But they differ in that they also propose to distinguish the humanities from the social sciences as well as from the physical sciences, and in that they dispute among themselves as to whether an emphasis on the subject matter or on the methods of the humanities is most effectual in accomplishing this distinction. In the late 19th century the German philosopher Wilhelm Dilthey called the humanities “the spiritual sciences” and “the human sciences” and described them, simply, as those areas of knowledge that lay outside of, and beyond, the subject matter of the physical sciences. On the other hand, Heinrich Rickert, an early 20th-century Neo-Kantian, argued that it is not subject matter but method of investigation that best characterizes the humanities; Rickert contended that whereas the physical sciences aim to move from particular instances to general laws, the human sciences are “idiographic”—they are devoted to the unique value of the particular within its cultural and human contexts and do not seek general laws. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries the American philosopher Martha Nussbaum emphasized the crucial importance of education in the humanities for maintaining a healthy democracy, for fostering a deeper understanding of human concerns and values, and for enabling students to rise above parochial perspectives and “the bondage of habit and custom” to become genuine citizens of the world.\n\n",

The term was formerly used to refer to the field of sociology, the original \"science of society\", established in the 18th century. In addition to sociology, it now encompasses a wide array of academic disciplines, including anthropology, archaeology, economics, geography, history, linguistics, management, communication studies, psychology, culturology, and political science.[1]\n\nPositivist social scientists use methods resembling those used in the natural sciences as tools for understanding societies, and so define science in its stricter modern sense. Interpretivist or speculative social scientists, by contrast, may use social critique or symbolic interpretation rather than constructing empirically falsifiable theories, and thus treat science in its broader sense.[2] In modern academic practice, researchers are often eclectic, using multiple methodologies (for instance, by combining both quantitative and qualitative research).[3] To gain a deeper understanding of complex human behavior in digital environments, social science disciplines have increasingly integrated interdisciplinary[4] approaches, big data, and computational tools. The term social research has also acquired a degree of autonomy as practitioners from various disciplines share similar goals and methods.[5]\n\nHistory\n\nThe history of the social sciences began in the Age of Enlightenment after 1651,[6] which saw a revolution within natural philosophy, changing the basic framework by which individuals understood what was scientific. Social sciences came forth from the moral philosophy of the time and were influenced by the Age of Revolutions, such as the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution.[7] The social sciences developed from the sciences (experimental and applied), or the systematic knowledge-bases or prescriptive practices, relating to the social improvement of a group of interacting entities.[8][9]\n\nThe beginnings of the social sciences in the 18th century are reflected in the grand encyclopedia of Diderot, with articles from Jean-Jacques Rousseau and other pioneers. The growth of the social sciences is also reflected in other specialized encyclopedias. The term \"social science\" was coined in French by Mirabeau in 1767, before becoming a distinct conceptual field in the nineteenth century.[10] Social science was influenced by positivism,[7] focusing on knowledge based on actual positive sense experience and avoiding the negative; metaphysical speculation was avoided. Auguste Comte used the term science sociale to describe the field, taken from the ideas of Charles Fourier; Comte also referred to the field as social physics.[7][11]\n\nFollowing this period, five paths of development sprang forth in the social sciences, influenced by Comte in other fields.[7] One route that was taken was the rise of social research. Large statistical surveys were undertaken in various parts of the United States and Europe. Another route undertaken was initiated by Émile Durkheim, studying \"social facts\", and Vilfredo Pareto, opening metatheoretical ideas and individual theories. A third means developed, arising from the methodological dichotomy present, in which social phenomena were identified with and understood; this was championed by figures such as Max Weber.[12] The fourth route taken, based in economics, was developed and furthered economic knowledge as a hard science. The last path was the correlation of knowledge and social values; the antipositivism and verstehen sociology of Max Weber firmly demanded this distinction. In this route, theory (description) and prescription were non-overlapping formal discussions of a subject.[13][14]\n\nThe foundation of social sciences in the West implies conditioned relationships between progressive and traditional spheres of knowledge. In some contexts, such as the Italian one, sociology slowly affirms itself and experiences the difficulty of affirming a strategic knowledge beyond philosophy and theology.[15]\n\nAround the start of the 20th century, Enlightenment philosophy was challenged in various quarters. After the use of classical theories since the end of the scientific revolution, various fields substituted mathematics studies for experimental studies and examining equations to build a theoretical structure. The development of social science subfields became very quantitative in methodology. The interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary nature of scientific inquiry into human behaviour, social and environmental factors affecting it, made many of the natural sciences interested in some aspects of social science methodology.[16] Examples of boundary blurring include emerging disciplines like social research of medicine, sociobiology, neuropsychology, bioeconomics and the history and sociology of science. Increasingly, quantitative research and qualitative methods are being integrated in the study of human action and its implications and consequences. In the first half of the 20th century, statistics became a free-standing discipline of applied mathematics.[17] Statistical methods were used confidently.\n\nIn the contemporary period, Karl Popper and Talcott Parsons influenced the furtherance of the social sciences.[7] Researchers continue to search for a unified consensus on what methodology might have the power and refinement to connect a proposed \"grand theory\" with the various midrange theories that, with considerable success, continue to provide usable frameworks for massive, growing data banks; for more, see consilience. The social sciences will for the foreseeable future be composed of different zones in the research of, and sometimes distinct in approach toward, the field.[7]\n\nThe term \"social science\" may refer either to the specific sciences of society established by thinkers such as Comte, Durkheim, Marx, and Weber, or more generally to all disciplines outside of \"noble science\" and arts. By the late 19th century, the academic social sciences were constituted of five fields: jurisprudence and amendment of the law, education, health, economy and trade, and art.[8]\n\nAround the start of the 21st century, the expanding domain of economics in the social sciences has been described as economic imperialism.[18]\n\nA distinction is usually drawn between the social sciences and the humanities. Classicist Allan Bloom writes in The Closing of the American Mind (1987):\n\nSocial science and humanities have a mutual contempt for one another, the former looking down on the latter as unscientific, the latter regarding the former as philistine. […] The difference comes down to the fact that social science really wants to be predictive, meaning that man is predictable, while the humanities say that he is not.[19]\n\nBranches\n\nThe social science disciplines are branches of knowledge taught and researched at the college or university level. Social science disciplines are defined and recognized by the academic journals in which research is published, and the learned social science societies and academic departments or faculties to which their practitioners belong. Social science fields of study usually have several sub-disciplines or branches, and the distinguishing lines between these are often both arbitrary and ambiguous.[20] The following are widely-considered to be social sciences:[7]\n\nAnthropology\n\nAnthropology is the holistic \"science of man\", a science of the totality of human existence.",

It is the use of “technological tools to do work of the kind that gets done in the humanities, asking the kinds of questions, whether they’re historical or literary,... [and] using computational tools that do the processing of the data and that assist the researcher in the findings that come out of that work” (Fitzpatrick).\n\n“By producing and using new applications and techniques, DH makes new kinds of teaching and research possible, while at the same time studying and critiquing how these impact cultural heritage and digital culture. Thus, a distinctive feature of DH is its cultivation of a two-way relationship between the humanities and the digital: the field both employs technology in the pursuit of humanities research and subjects technology to humanistic questioning and interrogation, often simultaneously” (Terras; Wikipedia).\n\n“It is not simply the humanities done with computers, nor is it computer science performed on topics of interest to the humanities” (Vartner, Hswe). Digital humanities is a more comprehensive and encompassing approach to studying the humanities. Researchers in all disciplines are drawing upon technology such as infographics, data visualization and virtual reality among others to make their work more dynamic and engaging (Vartner; Hswe).\n\nAnother description of digital humanities covers a “more traditional humanities-oriented question[ing] about the computing technologies that we’re working with” (Fitzpatrick). Recent and ongoing debates about the pervasive role of technology in our everyday lives through social media, AI and e-commerce are illustrative examples.  As technology becomes more and more embedded in our lives, it has led to concerns over privacy, misinformation, and safety; thus, subjecting the “digital” to a humanistic critique.\n\nSan José State University’s Deep Humanities and the Arts Initiative is an approach following this description of digital humanities. Launched in spring 2018, the initiative asks, “Is technology the answer to humanity’s problems or a threat to humanity as we know it?” As it posits this question, it calls for “an urgent need to reinvent the humanities & arts, redefine their relationship to STEM, and revitalize their role in our lives” (Krishnaswamy). Many of the panel papers presented at the Deep Humanities and Arts Initiative launch addressed the call for this reinvention of the humanities and arts and its relationship to STEM.\n\nRealistically, any form of teaching in the classroom today involves technology (especially true during this past year of remote learning) and is more capaciously identified as digital pedagogy (Harris). What does teaching look like when students learn “to think and work together in new ways, and to deepen their understanding of the academic subjects under consideration, through the use of such tools, platforms, and methods” to engage them in investigations using playfulness, openness, identity, agency, practice, and especially collaboration (Davis; Gold; Harris).\n\nFaculty across campus are exploring ways to integrate digital pedagogy into their classrooms using a variety of technologically enhanced strategies, such as mapping a novel, using recordings to learn different languages, creating memes about climate change, and visualizing data in the study of earthquakes, traffic patterns, and COVID-19 vaccinations. A key resource in this area is the Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities: Concepts, Models and Experiments, a curated collection of reusable resources for teaching and research. This peer-reviewed, open access guide offers assignments, syllabi, rubrics, articles and more — all  searchable by keywords — to help educators integrate all types of tech into the classroom.\n\nAt San José State University, digital humanities pedagogy invites students to co-create knowledge through project-based classes: “By enabling communication across communities and networks, by creating platforms that amplify the voices of those most in need of being heard, by pursuing projects that perform the work of recovery and resistance, and by undertaking research that intervenes in the areas of data surveillance and privacy, the ‘artist-theorists, programming humanists, activist-scholars, theoretical archivists, [and] critical race coders’ whom Tara McPherson, writing in the first volume of Debates in the Digital Humanities, called into being, have now been united with their task” (Gold; Klein). Promoting, investigating, discovering the resonance of underrepresented voices doesn’t mean teaching a digital humanities course, though — experimentation and play are already key components of most SJSU curricula (Davis; Harris).\n\nAs an area of study, digital humanities is ever shifting and evolving, with students, faculty, and the community producing projects that underscore what makes the humanities so exciting, while allowing all to learn a number of new methods.  The educational possibilities are unlimited, for those who create these projects as well as for those who can benefit from them!\n\nExplore the world of the digital humanities with us!\n\nDavis, Rebecca Frost and Katherine D.

Providing a 10-point typology of public humanities, this article explains why we need the humanities – as individuals and as societies – and narrates some moments when the humanities have changed the world. We discuss the rise of “public humanities,” some critiques of the field, and a vision for its future.\n\nKeywords\n\nPublic humanities happens whenever humanities scholarship interacts with public life.Footnote 1 The most basic form is interpretive thought and conversation about human creativity and culture. But a typology of public humanities includes at least 10 kinds:\n\n1.\nPublic-facing academic work, such as writing, teaching, community events, and social media;\n\n2.\nKnowledge derived from practitioners, such as museum professionals, non-profit workers, librarians, journalists, entrepreneurs, and tech developers;\n\n3.\nHumanistic knowledge created through collaboration among people of various publics;\n\n4.\nData on the humanities in public;\n\n5.\nActivism informed by humanities research;\n\n6.\nPolicy work, both writing and implementation;\n\n7.\nPedagogy for public humanities;\n\n8.\nEducational programs in public humanities – graduate, undergraduate, and continuing education;\n\n9.\nThe social and economic value of the humanities in public and of the public humanities in academia;\n\n10.\nHistories, theories, and critiques of the field of public humanities.Footnote 2\n\nThe humanities study the things humans make – our art, writings, thoughts, religions, governments, histories, technologies, and societies – helping us understand who we are, what we do, how we do it, why, and with what consequences.Footnote 3 For individuals, these studies are tools for living a meaningful life, meeting a basic human need to understand the things that bring us joy and sorrow. For societies, the humanities are a mechanism for progress, the means by which our pursuit of justice is informed by our pursuit of truth.Footnote 4\n\nThus, humanistic inquiry occurs in all societies, which in turn establish educational institutions to house the humanities, from Plato’s Academy in Greece (established 387 BCE), the Library of Alexandria in Egypt (around 331 BCE), and the Imperial University in China (141 BCE) to the University of al-Qarawiyyin in Morocco (859), the University of Bologna in Italy (1088), and the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic (1538). So began the academic humanities, giving structure and support to an organically public endeavor while bringing with them the problems inherent to institutions.\n\nBut the humanities frequently surface in public life beyond academia. Paul’s Letters and the Qur’an are sacred texts that began as humanities scholarship. Confucianism became state ideology in the Han Dynasty. Philosopher Karl Marx inspired the politics of communism. Thomas Clarkson’s grad school paper, “An Essay on the Slavery and Commerce of the Human Species, Particularly the African,” contributed to the abolition of slavery in the British Empire. Mary Wollstonecraft’s A Vindication of the Rights of Woman was cited by Suffragettes. Eric Williams’s research on the economics of Britain’s Slavery Abolition Act of 1833 informed his service as the first Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago. Anti-colonial psychologist Franz Fanon inspired revolutionaries from Malcom X and Che Guevara to Ali Shariati and Steve Biko. Intersectionality shifted from Kimberlie Crenshaw’s legal term in academic journals to an activist praxis (“my feminism will be intersectional or it will be bullshit”). Philosopher Judith Butler’s notion of gender as performance anticipated the rise of preferred pronouns as a social practice. Influential youth activists such as Malala Yousafzai, Greta Thunberg, and the survivors of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School have drawn upon the core humanities curriculum of their secondary educations.Footnote 5\n\nThe public value of the humanities is evident in the field’s impact on individuals, communities, societies, and industries.Footnote 6\n\n- In the 1940s to 1960s, leading agitators for African independence held humanities degrees, including Leopold Sedar Senghor, Aimé Césaire, J. F. Ade Ajayi, Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o, and Wole Soyinka.Footnote 7\n\n- Ninety-seven percent of Australians (aged 15 and above) engaged with the arts in 2022.Footnote 8\n\n- Eighty-four percent of Americans say that history education is just as important as business and engineering.Footnote 9\n\n- The Acropolis in Athens, Greece is so popular that it recently capped visitor numbers at 20,000 per day.Footnote 10\n\n- Leading CEOs often have humanities degrees, including Jack Ma (Alibaba), Susan Wojcicki (YouTube), and Michael Eisner (Walt Disney Company).Footnote 11\n\n- One-hundred and fifty countries unanimously recognized culture as a “global public good” at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Conference in 2022.Footnote 12\n\n- There are more than 50 million jobs in the creative industries globally, generating annual revenues of over $2 trillion.Footnote 13\n\n- Psychologists have shown empirically that engaging in the humanities makes people happier.Footnote 14\n\nYet news coverage often depicts a “crisis in the humanities” – declining student enrolments, decreased funding, and shuttered departments.Footnote 15 That crisis is really only in the academic humanities – the professional fields that operate out of colleges and universities. The public humanities are thriving, if we think about the interpretive thoughts and conversations that happen in our daily lives, on the Internet, at the dinner table, in classrooms, on holidays, at the pub, in houses of worship, on TV, and with our friends.\n\nWhile the humanities have always informed public life, the term “public humanities” is only about fifty years old.Footnote 16 Rooted in U.S. higher education, its earliest mentions relate to funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities, established in 1965. Then came the founding of humanities centers in the 1970s (starting with the National Humanities Center in 1978) and public humanities graduate programs in the 2000s (starting with the John Nicholas Brown Center for Public Humanities and Cultural Heritage at Brown University in 2002). In this genealogy, paradoxically, “public humanities” is an academic endeavor.\n\nThis institutional form of the public humanities is open to four critiques:\n\n1. The top-down gifting of knowledge from an educated elite to the unlearned public is a classist inheritance from the Victorian era.\n\n2. The North-American-ness of the field limits less resolutely academic forms of public humanities that exist throughout the rest of the world.\n\n3. In its heavily institutionalized form, public humanities can be more oriented to serving the needs of academics than those of any publics.\n\n4. Not all public humanities is good public humanities.Footnote 17\n\nOn this last point, we note that Hitler cited Nietzsche. State propaganda is public humanities; culture wars are public humanities; sages on stages with inflated egos are public humanities. Public humanities is not the answer to all our problems. It’s the site of the struggle.\n\nMeanwhile, many of the best instances do not call themselves “public humanities” – as with The 1619 Project. This collaboration among New York Times journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones and academic historians addressed an issue of urgent social concern in the United States by bringing scholarship from the margins of academia to the center of mass media.",

Applied linguistics seeks to utilize the scientific findings of the study of language for practical purposes, such as developing methods of improving language education and literacy.\n\nLinguistic features may be studied through a variety of perspectives: synchronically (by describing the structure of a language at a specific point in time) or diachronically (through the historical development of a language over a period of time), in monolinguals or in multilinguals, among children or among adults, in terms of how it is being learnt or how it was acquired, as abstract objects or as cognitive structures, through written texts or through oral elicitation, and finally through mechanical data collection or practical fieldwork.[7]\n\nLinguistics emerged from the field of philology,  of which some branches are more qualitative and holistic in approach.[8] Today, philology and linguistics are variably described as related fields, subdisciplines, or separate fields of language study but, by and large, linguistics can be seen as an umbrella term.[9] Linguistics is also related to the philosophy of language, stylistics, rhetoric, semiotics, lexicography, and translation.\n\nMajor subdisciplines\n\nHistorical linguistics\n\nHistorical linguistics is the study of how language changes over history, particularly with regard to a specific language or a group of languages. Western trends in historical linguistics date back to roughly the late 18th century, when the discipline grew out of philology, the study of ancient texts and oral traditions.[10]\n\nHistorical linguistics emerged as one of the first few sub-disciplines in the field, and was most widely practised during the late 19th century.[11] Despite a shift in focus in the 20th century towards formalism and generative grammar, which studies the universal properties of language, historical research today still remains a significant field of linguistic inquiry. Subfields of the discipline include language change and grammaticalization.\n\nHistorical linguistics studies language change either diachronically (through a comparison of different time periods in the past and present) or in a synchronic manner (by observing developments between different variations that exist within the current linguistic stage of a language).[12]\n\nAt first, historical linguistics was the cornerstone of comparative linguistics, which involves a study of the relationship between different languages.[13] At that time, scholars of historical linguistics were only concerned with creating different categories of language families, and reconstructing prehistoric proto-languages by using both the comparative method and the method of internal reconstruction. Internal reconstruction is the method by which an element that contains a certain meaning is re-used in different contexts or environments where there is a variation in either sound or analogy.[13][better source needed]\n\nThe reason for this had been to describe well-known Indo-European languages, many of which had detailed documentation and long written histories. Scholars of historical linguistics also studied Uralic languages, another European language family for which very little written material existed back then. After that, there also followed significant work on the corpora of other languages, such as the Austronesian languages and the Native American language families.\n\nIn historical work, the uniformitarian principle is generally the underlying working hypothesis, occasionally also clearly expressed.[14] The principle was expressed early by William Dwight Whitney, who considered it imperative, a \"must\", of historical linguistics to \"look to find the same principle operative also in the very outset of that [language] history.\"[15]\n\nThe above approach of comparativism in linguistics is now, however, only a small part of the much broader discipline called historical linguistics. The comparative study of specific Indo-European languages is considered a highly specialized field today, while comparative research is carried out over the subsequent internal developments in a language: in particular, over the development of modern standard varieties of languages, and over the development of a language from its standardized form to its varieties.[citation needed]\n\nFor instance, some scholars also tried to establish super-families, linking, for example, Indo-European, Uralic, and other language families to a hypothetical Nostratic language group.[16] While these attempts are still not widely accepted as credible methods, they provide necessary information to establish relatedness in language change. This is generally hard to find for events long ago, due to the occurrence of chance word resemblances and variations between language groups. A limit of around 10,000 years is often assumed for the functional purpose of conducting research.[17] It is also hard to date various proto-languages. Even though several methods are available, these languages can be dated only approximately.[18]\n\nIn modern historical linguistics, we examine how languages change over time, focusing on the relationships between dialects within a specific period. This includes studying morphological, syntactical, and phonetic shifts. Connections between dialects in the past and present are also explored.[19]\n\nSyntax\n\nSyntax is the study of how words and morphemes combine to form larger units such as phrases and sentences. Central concerns of syntax include word order, grammatical relations, constituency,[20] agreement, the nature of crosslinguistic variation, and the relationship between form and meaning. There are numerous approaches to syntax that differ in their central assumptions and goals.\n\nMorphology\n\nMorphology is the study of words, including the principles by which they are formed, and how they relate to one another within a language.",

      "raw_content": "Origin of language\n\n\n\nThe origin of language, its relationship with human evolution, and its consequences have been subjects of study for centuries. Scholars wishing to study the origins of language draw inferences from evidence such as the fossil record, archaeological evidence, and the contemporary language diversity. They can also learn the studies of language acquisition, and comparisons between human language and systems of animal communication (particularly other primates).[1] Many argue for the close relation between the origins of language and the origins of modern human behavior, but there is little agreement about the facts and implications of this connection.\n\nThe shortage of direct, empirical evidence has caused many scholars to regard the entire topic as unsuitable for serious study; in 1866, the Linguistic Society of Paris banned any existing or future debates on the subject, a prohibition which remained influential across much of the Western world until the late twentieth century.[2] Various hypotheses have been developed on the emergence of language.[3] While Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection had provoked a surge of speculation on the origin of language over a century and a half ago, the speculations had not resulted in a scientific consensus by 1996.[4] Despite this, academic interest has returned to the topic in the early 1990s. Linguists, archaeologists, psychologists, and anthropologists have renewed the investigation into the origin of language with modern methods.[5]\n\nContents\n\nApproaches\n\nAttempts to explain the origin of language take a variety of forms:[6]\n\nMost linguistic scholars as of 2024[update] favor continuity-based theories, but they vary in how they hypothesize language development.[citation needed] Some among those who consider language as mostly innate avoid speculating about specific precursors in nonhuman primates, stressing simply that the language faculty must have evolved gradually.[7]\n\nThose who consider language as learned socially, such as Michael Tomasello, consider it developing from the cognitively controlled aspects of primate communication, mostly gestural rather than vocal.[8][9] Where vocal precursors are concerned, many continuity theorists envisage language as evolving from early human capacities for song.[10][11][12][13]\n\nNoam Chomsky, a proponent of discontinuity theory, argues that a single change occurred in humans before leaving Africa, coincident with the Great Leap approximately 100,000 years ago, in which a common language faculty developed in a group of humans and their descendants. Chomsky bases his argument on the observation that any human baby of any culture can be raised in a different culture and will completely assimilate the language and behavior of the new culture in which they were raised. This implies that no major change to the human language faculty has occurred since they left Africa.[14]\n\nTranscending the continuity-versus-discontinuity divide, some scholars view the emergence of language as the consequence of some kind of social transformation[15] that, by generating unprecedented levels of public trust, liberated a genetic potential for linguistic creativity that had previously lain dormant.[16][17][18] \"Ritual/speech coevolution theory\" exemplifies this approach.[19][20] Scholars in this intellectual camp point to the fact that even chimpanzees and bonobos have latent symbolic capacities that they rarely—if ever—use in the wild.[21] Objecting to the sudden mutation idea, these authors argue that even if a chance mutation were to install a language organ in an evolving bipedal primate, it would be adaptively useless under all known primate social conditions. A very specific social structure – one capable of upholding unusually high levels of public accountability and trust – must have evolved before or concurrently with language to make reliance on \"cheap signals\" (e.g. words) an evolutionarily stable strategy.\n\nSince the emergence of language lies so far back in human prehistory, the relevant developments have left no direct historical traces, and comparable processes cannot be observed today. Despite this, the emergence of new sign languages in modern times—Nicaraguan Sign Language, for example—may offer insights into the developmental stages and creative processes necessarily involved.[22] Another approach inspects early human fossils, looking for traces of physical adaptation to language use.[23][24] In some cases, when the DNA of extinct humans can be recovered, the presence or absence of genes considered to be language-relevant—FOXP2, for example—may prove informative.[25] Another approach, this time archaeological, involves invoking symbolic behavior (such as repeated ritual activity) that may leave an archaeological trace—such as mining and modifying ochre pigments for body-painting—while developing theoretical arguments to justify inferences from symbolism in general to language in particular.[26][27][28]\n\nThe time range for the evolution of language or its anatomical prerequisites extends, at least in principle, from the phylogenetic divergence of Homo (2.3 to 2.4 million years ago) from Pan (5 to 6 million years ago) to the emergence of full behavioral modernity some 50,000–150,000 years ago. Few dispute that Australopithecus probably lacked vocal communication significantly more sophisticated than that of great apes in general,[29] but scholarly opinions vary as to the developments since the appearance of Homo some 2.5 million years ago. Some scholars assume the development of primitive language-like systems (proto-language) as early as Homo habilis, while others place the development of symbolic communication only with Homo erectus (1.8 million years ago) or with Homo heidelbergensis (0.6 million years ago) and the development of language proper with Homo sapiens, currently estimated at less than 200,000 years ago.\n\nUsing statistical methods to estimate the time required to achieve the current spread and diversity in modern languages, Johanna Nichols—a linguist at the University of California, Berkeley—argued in 1998 that vocal languages must have begun diversifying in the human species at least 100,000 years ago.[30] Estimates of this kind are not universally accepted, but jointly considering genetic, archaeological, palaeontological, and much other evidence indicates that language likely emerged somewhere in sub-Saharan Africa during the Middle Stone Age, roughly contemporaneous with the speciation of Homo sapiens.[31]\n\nLanguage origin hypotheses\n\nEarly speculations\n\nI cannot doubt that language owes its origin to the imitation and modification, aided by signs and gestures, of various natural sounds, the voices of other animals, and man's own instinctive cries.\n\nIn 1861, historical linguist Max Müller published a list of speculative theories concerning the origins of spoken language:[33]\n\nMost scholars today consider all such theories not so much wrong—they occasionally offer peripheral insights—as naïve and irrelevant.[35][36] The problem with these theories is that they rest on the assumption that once early humans had discovered a workable mechanism for linking sounds with meanings, language would automatically have evolved.[citation needed]\n\nMuch earlier, medieval Muslim scholars developed theories on the origin of language.[37][38] Their theories were of five general types:[39]\n\nProblems of reliability and deception\n\nFrom the perspective of signalling theory, the main obstacle to the evolution of language-like communication in nature is not a mechanistic one. Rather, it is the fact that symbols—arbitrary associations of sounds or other perceptible forms with corresponding meanings—are unreliable and may as well be false.[40][41][42] The problem of reliability was not recognized at all by Darwin, Müller or the other early evolutionary theorists.\n\nAnimal vocal signals are, for the most part, intrinsically reliable.",

The origin of language is a hotly contested topic, with some languages tentatively traced back to the Paleolithic. However, archaeological and written records only extend the history of language into ancient times and the Neolithic.\n\nThe distribution of languages has changed substantially over time. Major regional languages like Elamite, Sogdian, Koine Greek, or Nahuatl in ancient, post-classical and early modern times have been overtaken by others due to changing balance of power, conflict and migration. The relative status of languages has also changed, as with the decline in prominence of French and German relative to English in the late 20th century.\n\nPrehistory\n\nPaleolithic (200,000–20,000 BP)\n\nThe highly diverse Nilo-Saharan languages, first proposed as a family by Joseph Greenberg in 1963 might have originated in the Upper Paleolithic.[1] Given the presence of a tripartite number system in modern Nilo-Saharan languages, linguist N.A. Blench inferred a noun classifier in the proto-language, distributed based on water courses in the Sahara during the \"wet period\" of the Neolithic Subpluvial.[2]\n\nMesolithic (20,000–8,000 BP)\n\nThroughout the 1990s and 2000s, researchers attempted to reconstruct the Proto-Afroasiatic language, suggesting it likely arose between 18,000 and 12,000 years ago in the Levant, suggesting that it may have descended from the Natufian culture and migrated into Africa before diverging into different languages.[3][4]\n\nNeolithic (12,000–6500 BP)\n\nPopulation genetics research in the 2000s suggests that the very earliest predecessors of the Dravidian languages may have been spoken in south-west Iran between 15,000 and 10,000 years ago before spreading to India much later.[5] The Eastern Sudanic group of Nilo-Saharan languages may have unified around 7000 years ago.[1]\n\nAryon Rodrigues hypothesizes the emergence of a Proto-Tupian language between the Guaporé and Aripuanã rivers, in the Madeira River basin (corresponding to the modern Brazilian state of Rondônia) around 5000 years ago.[relevant?][6]\n\nAncient history (3000 BCE–500 CE)\n\nAfrica\n\nBeginning in the Levant around the 11th century BC, Phoenicia became an early trading state and colonizing power, spreading its language to what is now Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco as well as southern Spain, the Balearic Islands, coastal areas of Sardinia and Corsica as well as the island of Cyprus. The Phoenician alphabet is the oldest abjad (consonantal alphabet)—and the ancestor of the Latin alphabet.[7]\n\nBetween 3000 and 4000 years ago, Proto-Bantu, spoken in parts of Central and West Africa in the vicinity of Cameroon split off from other Bantoid languages with the start of the Bantu expansion.[8]\nWell documented languages are primarily preserved in—or from—North Africa, where complex states formed and interacted with other parts of the Mediterranean world. Punic, a variant of Phoenician became a dominant language for perhaps two centuries from the 8th century to 6th century in the Carthaginian Empire.[9] The language maintained lengthy contacts with the rest of the Phoenician sprachraum until the defeat of the empire by Rome in 146 BC, but began to adopt more words and names from neighboring Berber languages over time. The Roman invaders showed appreciation for monumental Carthaginian inscriptions, translating them and giving them as gifts for Berber libraries. A form of the language, referred to by modern scholars as Latino-Punic continued for centuries afterward, with the same word structures and phonology but writing conducted in Latin script.[10]\n\nThe nature of Proto-Berber and the emergence of the Berber languages is unclear and may have begun around the time of Mesolithic Capsian culture.[11] Roger Blench suggests that Proto-Berber speakers spread into North Africa from the Nile River valley around 4000 to 5000 years ago, after splitting off from early Afroasiatic.[12] In this model, early Berbers borrowed many words from contact with Carthaginian Punic and Latin. Only the Zenaga language lacks Punic loanwords.\n\nThe Nubian civilization flourished along the southern reach of the Nile River, maintaining substantial trade and contact with first Egypt and then Rome. For 700 years people in the Kingdom of Kush spoke the Meroitic language, from 300 BCE to 400 CE. Inscribed in the Meroitic alphabet or hieroglyphics, the language is poorly understood due to a scarcity of bilingual texts. As a result, modern linguists have continuously debated whether the language was Nilo-Saharan or Afroasiatic.[13]\n\nDuring the Migration Period that brought on the fragmentation of the Roman Empire, Germanic groups briefly expanded out of Europe into North Africa. Speakers of the poorly attested, but presumably East Germanic Vandalic language took control of much of Spain and Portugal and then crossed into North Africa in the 430s, holding territory until the 6th century when they were placed under Byzantine rule following a military defeat in 536.\n\nAmericas\n\nThe Alaska Native Language Center indicates that the common ancestral language of the Inuit languages and of Aleut divided into the Inuit and Aleut branches at least 4,000 years ago.[14][15]\n\nIn Mesoamerica, the Oto-Manguean languages existed by at least 2000 BC, potentially originated several thousand years earlier in the Tehuacán culture of the Tehuacán valley. The undeciphered Zapotec script represents the oldest piece of Mesoamerican writing.[16]\n\nAsia\n\nThroughout ancient times, Asia witnessed the rise of several large, long lasting civilizations. Relatively sparse comparative linguistics research means that the origin of the Dravidian languages now spoken in southern India and a small portion of Pakistan is poorly understood. Proto-Dravidian was likely spoken in India as early as the 4th millennium BC before being partly displaced by Indo-Aryan languages.[17] The Indus Valley civilization is generally interpreted as Dravidian speaking.[18] Indo-Aryan speakers began to take over the plains of northern India spurring Sanskritization after 1500 BC.\n\nBenno Landsberger and other Assyriologists suggest that a hypothetical unclassified language termed Proto-Euphratean may have been spoken in southern Iraq during the Ubaid period from 5300 to 4700 BC, possibly by people belonging to the Samarran culture.[19]\n\nThe Gutian people, a group of nomadic invaders from the Zagros Mountains formed the Gutian dynasty and ruled Sumer.

      "raw_content": "Language\n\n\n\nLanguage is a structured system of communication that consists of grammar and vocabulary. It is the primary means by which humans convey meaning, both in spoken and signed forms, and may also be conveyed through writing. Human language is characterized by its cultural and historical diversity, with significant variations observed between cultures and across time.[1] Human languages possess the properties of productivity and displacement, which enable the creation of an infinite number of sentences, and the ability to refer to objects, events, and ideas that are not immediately present in the discourse. The use of human language relies on social convention and is acquired through learning.\n\nEstimates of the number of human languages in the world vary between 5,000 and 7,000. Precise estimates depend on an arbitrary distinction (dichotomy) established between languages and dialects.[2] Natural languages are spoken, signed, or both; however, any language can be encoded into secondary media using auditory, visual, or tactile stimuli – for example, writing, whistling, signing, or braille. In other words, human language is modality-independent, but written or signed language is the way to inscribe or encode the natural human speech or gestures.\n\nDepending on philosophical perspectives regarding the definition of language and meaning, when used as a general concept, \"language\" may refer to the cognitive ability to learn and use systems of complex communication, or to describe the set of rules that makes up these systems, or the set of utterances that can be produced from those rules. All languages rely on the process of semiosis to relate signs to particular meanings. Oral, manual and tactile languages contain a phonological system that governs how symbols are used to form sequences known as words or morphemes, and a syntactic system that governs how words and morphemes are combined to form phrases and utterances.\n\nThe scientific study of language is called linguistics. Critical examinations of languages, such as philosophy of language, the relationships between language and thought, how words represent experience, etc., have been debated at least since Gorgias and Plato in ancient Greek civilization. Thinkers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778) have argued that language originated from emotions, while others like Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) have argued that languages originated from rational and logical thought. Twentieth century philosophers such as Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889–1951) argued that philosophy is really the study of language itself. Major figures in contemporary linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky.\n\nLanguage is thought to have gradually diverged from earlier primate communication systems when early hominins acquired the ability to form a theory of mind and shared intentionality.[3][4] This development is sometimes thought to have coincided with an increase in brain volume, and many linguists see the structures of language as having evolved to serve specific communicative and social functions. Language is processed in many different locations in the human brain, but especially in Broca's and Wernicke's areas. Humans acquire language through social interaction in early childhood, and children generally speak fluently by approximately three years old. Language and culture are codependent. Therefore, in addition to its strictly communicative uses, language has social uses such as signifying group identity, social stratification, as well as use for social grooming and entertainment.\n\nLanguages evolve and diversify over time, and the history of their evolution can be reconstructed by comparing modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral languages must have had in order for the later developmental stages to occur. A group of languages that descend from a common ancestor is known as a language family; in contrast, a language that has been demonstrated not to have any living or non-living relationship with another language is called a language isolate. There are also many unclassified languages whose relationships have not been established, and spurious languages may have not existed at all. Academic consensus holds that between 50% and 90% of languages spoken at the beginning of the 21st century will probably have become extinct by the year 2100.[5][6][7]\n\nContents\n\nDefinitions\n\nThe English word language derives ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *dn̥ǵʰwéh₂s \"tongue, speech, language\" through Latin lingua, \"language; tongue\", and Old French language.[8] The word is sometimes used to refer to codes, ciphers, and other kinds of artificially constructed communication systems such as formally defined computer languages used for computer programming. Unlike conventional human languages, a formal language in this sense is a system of signs for encoding and decoding information. This article specifically concerns the properties of natural human language as it is studied in the discipline of linguistics.\n\nAs an object of linguistic study, \"language\" has two primary meanings: an abstract concept, and a specific linguistic system, e.g. \"French\". The Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, who defined the modern discipline of linguistics, first explicitly formulated the distinction using the French word langage for language as a concept, langue as a specific instance of a language system, and parole for the concrete use of speech in a particular language.[9]\n\nWhen speaking of language as a general concept, definitions can be used which stress different aspects of the phenomenon.[10] These definitions also entail different approaches and understandings of language, and they also inform different and often incompatible schools of linguistic theory.[11] Debates about the nature and origin of language go back to the ancient world. Greek philosophers such as Gorgias and Plato debated the relation between words, concepts and reality. Gorgias argued that language could represent neither the objective experience nor human experience, and that communication and truth were therefore impossible. Plato maintained that communication is possible because language represents ideas and concepts that exist independently of, and prior to, language.[12]\n\nDuring the Enlightenment and its debates about human origins, it became fashionable to speculate about the origin of language. Thinkers such as Rousseau and Johann Gottfried Herder argued that language had originated in the instinctive expression of emotions, and that it was originally closer to music and poetry than to the logical expression of rational thought. Rationalist philosophers such as Kant and René Descartes held the opposite view. Around the turn of the 20th century, thinkers began to wonder about the role of language in shaping our experiences of the world – asking whether language simply reflects the objective structure of the world, or whether it creates concepts that in turn impose structure on our experience of the objective world. This led to the question of whether philosophical problems are really firstly linguistic problems. The resurgence of the view that language plays a significant role in the creation and circulation of concepts, and that the study of philosophy is essentially the study of language, is associated with what has been called the linguistic turn and philosophers such as Wittgenstein in 20th-century philosophy. These debates about language in relation to meaning and reference, cognition and consciousness remain active today.[13]\n\nMental faculty, organ or instinct\n\nOne definition sees language primarily as the mental faculty that allows humans to undertake linguistic behaviour: to learn languages and to produce and understand utterances. This definition stresses the universality of language to all humans, and it emphasizes the biological basis for the human capacity for language as a unique development of the human brain.",

The word was first used in the middle of the 19th century to emphasize the difference between a newer approach to the study of language that was then developing and the more traditional approach of philology. The differences were and are largely matters of attitude, emphasis, and purpose. The philologist is concerned primarily with the historical development of languages as it is manifest in written texts and in the context of the associated literature and culture. The linguist, though he may be interested in written texts and in the development of languages through time, tends to give priority to spoken languages and to the problems of analyzing them as they operate at a given point in time.\n\nThe field of linguistics may be divided in terms of three dichotomies: synchronic versus diachronic, theoretical versus applied, and microlinguistics versus macrolinguistics. A synchronic description of a language describes the language as it is at a given time; a diachronic description is concerned with the historical development of the language and the structural changes that have taken place in it. The goal of theoretical linguistics is the construction of a general theory of the structure of language or of a general theoretical framework for the description of languages; the aim of applied linguistics is the application of the findings and techniques of the scientific study of language to practical tasks, especially to the elaboration of improved methods of language teaching. The terms microlinguistics and macrolinguistics are not yet well established, and they are, in fact, used here purely for convenience. The former refers to a narrower and the latter to a much broader view of the scope of linguistics. According to the microlinguistic view, languages should be analyzed for their own sake and without reference to their social function, to the manner in which they are acquired by children, to the psychological mechanisms that underlie the production and reception of speech, to the literary and the aesthetic or communicative function of language, and so on. In contrast, macrolinguistics embraces all of these aspects of language. Various areas within macrolinguistics have been given terminological recognition: psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, anthropological linguistics, dialectology, mathematical and computational linguistics, and stylistics. Macrolinguistics should not be identified with applied linguistics. The application of linguistic methods and concepts to language teaching may well involve other disciplines in a way that microlinguistics does not. But there is, in principle, a theoretical aspect to every part of macrolinguistics, no less than to microlinguistics.\n\nA large portion of this article is devoted to theoretical, synchronic microlinguistics, which is generally acknowledged as the central part of the subject; it will be abbreviated henceforth as theoretical linguistics.\n\nHistory of linguistics\n\nEarlier history\n\nNon-Western traditions\n\nLinguistic speculation and investigation, insofar as is known, has gone on in only a small number of societies. To the extent that Mesopotamian, Chinese, and Arabic learning dealt with grammar, their treatments were so enmeshed in the particularities of those languages and so little known to the European world until recently that they have had virtually no impact on Western linguistic tradition. Chinese linguistic and philological scholarship stretches back for more than two millennia, but the interest of those scholars was concentrated largely on phonetics, writing, and lexicography; their consideration of grammatical problems was bound up closely with the study of logic.\n\nCertainly the most interesting non-Western grammatical tradition—and the most original and independent—is that of India, which dates back at least two and one-half millennia and which culminates with the grammar of Panini, of the 5th century bce. There are three major ways in which the Sanskrit tradition has had an impact on modern linguistic scholarship. As soon as Sanskrit became known to the Western learned world, the unravelling of comparative Indo-European grammar ensued, and the foundations were laid for the whole 19th-century edifice of comparative philology and historical linguistics. But, for this, Sanskrit was simply a part of the data; Indian grammatical learning played almost no direct part. Nineteenth-century workers, however, recognized that the native tradition of phonetics in ancient India was vastly superior to Western knowledge, and this had important consequences for the growth of the science of phonetics in the West. Third, there is in the rules or definitions (sutras) of Panini a remarkably subtle and penetrating account of Sanskrit grammar. The construction of sentences, compound nouns, and the like is explained through ordered rules operating on underlying structures in a manner strikingly similar in part to modes of modern theory. As might be imagined, this perceptive Indian grammatical work held great fascination for 20th-century theoretical linguists. A study of Indian logic in relation to Paninian grammar alongside Aristotelian and Western logic in relation to Greek grammar and its successors could bring illuminating insights.\n\nWhereas in ancient Chinese learning a separate field of study that might be called grammar scarcely took root, in ancient India a sophisticated version of this discipline developed early alongside the other sciences. Even though the study of Sanskrit grammar may originally have had the practical aim of keeping the sacred Vedic texts and their commentaries pure and intact, the study of grammar in India in the 1st millennium bce had already become an intellectual end in itself.\n\n",

The functions of language include communication, the expression of identity, play, imaginative expression, and emotional release.\nCharacteristics of language\nDefinitions of language\nMany definitions of language have been proposed. Henry Sweet, an English phonetician and language scholar, stated: “Language is the expression of ideas by means of speech-sounds combined into words. Words are combined into sentences, this combination answering to that of ideas into thoughts.” The American linguists Bernard Bloch and George L. Trager formulated the following definition: “A language is a system of arbitrary vocal symbols by means of which a social group cooperates.” Any succinct definition of language makes a number of presuppositions and begs a number of questions. The first, for example, puts excessive weight on “thought,” and the second uses “arbitrary” in a specialized, though legitimate, way.\nA number of considerations (marked in italics below) enter into a proper understanding of language as a subject:\nEvery physiologically and mentally typical person acquires in childhood the ability to make use, as both sender and receiver, of a system of communication that comprises a circumscribed set of symbols (e.g., sounds, gestures, or written or typed characters).",

      "raw_content": "5 Theories on the Origins of Language\n\nWhat was the first language, and how, when, and where did it begin? Until recently, a sensible linguist would likely respond to such questions with a shrug and a sigh. As anthropology professor Bernard Campbell stated flatly in \"Humankind Emerging,\" we simply don't know—and never will—how or when language began.\n\nIt's hard to imagine a cultural phenomenon that's more important than the development of language. And yet no human attribute offers less conclusive evidence regarding its origins.\n\nThe absence of such evidence certainly hasn't discouraged speculation about the origins of language. Over the centuries, many theories have been put forward—and just about all of them have been challenged, discounted, and often ridiculed. Each theory accounts for only a small part of what we know about language.\n\nHere are five of the oldest and most common theories of how language began.\n\n1. The Bow-Wow Theory\n\nAccording to this theory, language began when our ancestors started imitating the natural sounds around them. The first speech was onomatopoeic—marked by echoic words such as moo, meow, splash, cuckoo, and bang.\n\nSo what's wrong with this theory? Well, relatively few words are onomatopoeic, and these words vary from one language to another. For instance, a dog's bark is heard as au au in Brazil, ham ham in Albania, and wang, wang in China. In addition, many onomatopoeic words are of recent origin, and not all are derived from natural sounds.\n\n2. The Ding-Dong Theory\n\nThis theory, favored by ancient philosophers Plato and Pythagoras, maintains that speech arose in response to the essential qualities of objects in the environment. The original sounds people made were supposedly in harmony with the world around them.\n\nApart from some rare instances of sound symbolism, there is no persuasive evidence, in any language, of an innate connection between sound and meaning.\n\n3. The La-La Theory\n\nDanish linguist Otto Jespersen suggested that language may have developed from sounds associated with love, play, and (especially) song.\n\nAs David Crystal notes in \"How Language Works,\" this theory still fails to account for \"... the gap between the emotional and the rational aspects of speech expression... .\"\n\n4. The Pooh-Pooh Theory\n\nThis theory holds that speech originated with interjections—spontaneous cries of pain (\"Ouch!\"), surprise (\"Oh!\"), and other emotions (\"Yabba dabba do!\").\n\nHowever, no language contains very many interjections, and, Crystal points out that the clicks, intakes of breath, and other noises used in this way \"bear little relationship to the vowels and consonants found in phonology.\"\n\n5. The Yo-He-Ho Theory\n\nAccording to this theory, language evolved from the grunts, groans, and snorts evoked by heavy physical labor.\n\nThough this notion may account for some of the rhythmic features of the language, it doesn't go very far in explaining where words come from.\n\nWill We Ever Discover the Origin of Language?\n\nAs American linguist Peter Farb wrote in \"Word Play: What Happens When People Talk,\" virtually all these theories \"have serious flaws, and none can withstand the scrutiny of present knowledge about the structure of language and about the evolution of our species.\"\n\nBut does this mean that all questions about the origin of language are unanswerable? Not necessarily. Over the past 20 years, scholars from such diverse fields as genetics, anthropology, and cognitive science have been engaged, as linguist Christine Kenneally says in her book \"The First Word,\" in \"a cross-discipline, multidimensional treasure hunt\" to find out how language began. It is, she says, \"the hardest problem in science today.\"\n\nThe Evolution of Human Language\n\nStill curious about language? There are several other theories about the origin and evolution of human language. Among other things considered, physical adaptations in humans, such as changes in teeth, lips, and the larynx, as well as theories on the role of gestures and social bonding, contribute to the ongoing debate on the evolution of language.\n\nFollow Us\n\n",

The convicted traitor was fastened by the feet to a hurdle, or wooden panel, and drawn behind a horse to the place of execution, where he was thenhanged(almost to the point of death),emasculated,disembowelled,beheaded, andquartered. His remains would then often be displayed in prominent places across the country, such asLondon Bridge, to serve as a warning of the fate of traitors. The punishment was only ever applied to men; for reasons of public decency, women convicted of high treason were insteadburned at the stake.It became astatutorypunishment in theKingdom of Englandfor high treason in 1352 underKing Edward III(1327–1377), although similar rituals are recorded during the reign ofKing Henry III(1216–1272). The same punishment applied to traitors against the king in Ireland from the 15th century onward; William Overy was hanged, drawn and quartered byLord LieutenantRichard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of Yorkin 1459, and from the reign ofKing Henry VIIit was made part of statutory law.Matthew Lambertwas among the most notable Irishmen to suffer this punishment, in 1581 inWexford.The severity of the sentence wasmeasured against the seriousness of the crime. As an attack on themonarch's authority, high treason was considered a deplorable act demanding the most extreme form of punishment. Although some convicts had their sentences modified and suffered a less ignominious end, over a period of several hundred years many men found guilty of high treason were subjected to the law's ultimate sanction.

The twenty-one signatories of the Ordinances are referred to as theLords Ordainers, or simply theOrdainers. English setbacks in theScottish war, combined with perceived extortionate royal fiscal policies, set the background for the writing of the Ordinances in which the administrative prerogatives of the king were largely appropriated by a baronial council. The Ordinances reflect theProvisions of Oxfordand theProvisions of Westminsterfrom the late 1250s, but unlike the Provisions, the Ordinances featured a new concern with fiscal reform, specifically  redirecting revenues from the king'shouseholdto theexchequer.Just as instrumental to their conception were other issues, particularly  discontent with the king'sfavourite,Piers Gaveston, whom the barons subsequently banished from the realm. Edward II accepted the Ordinances only under coercion, and a long struggle for their repeal ensued that did not end until EarlThomas of Lancaster, the leader of the Ordainers, was executed in 1322.

According to Encyclopædia Britannica, it is defined as \"the mechanism, process, institution, practice, or norm that supports the equality of all citizens before the law, secures a nonarbitrary form of government, and more generally prevents the arbitrary use of power.\"[4]\n\nUse of the phrase can be traced to 16th-century Britain. In the following century, Scottish theologian Samuel Rutherford employed it in arguing against the divine right of kings.[5] John Locke wrote that freedom in society means being subject only to laws written by a legislature that apply to everyone, with a person being otherwise free from both governmental and private restrictions of liberty. The phrase \"rule of law\" was further popularized in the 19th century by British jurist A. V. Dicey. However, the principle, if not the phrase itself, was recognized by ancient thinkers. Aristotle wrote: \"It is more proper that law should govern than any one of the citizens.\"[6][7]\n\nThe term rule of law is closely related to constitutionalism as well as Rechtsstaat. It refers to a political situation, not to any specific legal rule.[8][9][10] Distinct is the rule of man, where one person or group of persons rule arbitrarily.[11]\n\nHistory\n\nAlthough credit for popularizing the expression \"the rule of law\" in modern times is usually given to A. V. Dicey,[12][13] development of the legal concept can be traced through history to many ancient civilizations, including ancient Greece, Mesopotamia, India, and Rome.[14][15]\n\nEarly history (to 15th century)\n\nThe earliest conception of rule of law can be traced back to the Indian epics Ramayana and Mahabharata - the earliest versions of which date around to 8th or 9th centuries BC.[16][17][18] The Mahabharata deals with the concepts of Dharma (used to mean law and duty interchangeably), Rajdharma (duty of the king) and Dharmaraja. It states in one of its slokas that,\"The people should execute a king who does not protect them, but deprives them of their property and assets and who takes no advice or guidance from any one. Such a king is not a king but misfortune.\"[19][20]\n\nOther sources for the philosophy of rule of law can be traced to the Upanishads which state that, \"The law is the king of the kings. No one is higher than the law. Not even the king.\" Other commentaries include Kautilya's Arthashastra (4th-century BC), Manusmriti (dated to the 1st to 3rd century CE), Yajnavalkya-Smriti (dated between the 3rd and 5th century CE), Brihaspati Smriti (dated between 15 CE and 16 CE).[21][22]\n\nAncient Greece\n\nSeveral scholars have also traced the concept of the rule of law back to 4th-century BC Athens, seeing it either as the dominant value of the Athenian democracy,[23] or as one held in conjunction with the concept of popular sovereignty.[24] However, these arguments have been challenged and the present consensus is that upholding an abstract concept of the rule of law was not \"the predominant consideration\" of the Athenian legal system.[25] Aristotle, in his Politics, wrote: \"It is more proper that law should govern than any one of the citizens: upon the same principle, if it is advantageous to place the supreme power in some particular persons, they should be appointed to be only guardians, and the servants of the laws.\"[26]\n\nThe idea of the rule of law can be regarded as a modern iteration of the ideas of ancient Greek philosophers, who argued that the best form of government was rule by the best men.[27] Plato advocated a benevolent monarchy ruled by an idealized philosopher king, who was above the law.[27] Plato nevertheless hoped that the best men would be good at respecting established laws, explaining that \"Where the law is subject to some other authority and has none of its own, the collapse of the state, in my view, is not far off; but if law is the master of the government and the government is its slave, then the situation is full of promise and men enjoy all the blessings that the gods shower on a state.\"[28] Similarly, Aristotle flatly opposed letting the highest officials wield power beyond guarding and serving the laws.[27] In other words, Aristotle advocated the rule of law:\n\nIt is more proper that law should govern than any one of the citizens: upon the same principle, if it is advantageous to place the supreme power in some particular persons, they should be appointed to be only guardians, and the servants of the laws.[26]\n\nThe Roman statesman Cicero is often cited as saying, roughly: \"We are all servants of the laws in order to be free.\"[29] During the Roman Republic, controversial magistrates might be put on trial when their terms of office expired. Under the Roman Empire, the sovereign was personally immune (legibus solutus), but those with grievances could sue the treasury.[12]\n\nChina\n\nIn China, members of the school of legalism during the 3rd century BC argued for using law as a tool of governance, but they promoted \"rule by law\" as opposed to \"rule of law,\" meaning that they placed the aristocrats and emperor above the law.[30] In contrast, the Huang–Lao school of Daoism rejected legal positivism in favor of a natural law that even the ruler would be subject to.[31]\n\nThe ancient concept of rule of law can be distinguished from rule by law, according to political science professor Li Shuguang: \"The difference ... is that, under the rule of law, the law is preeminent and can serve as a check against the abuse of power.",

Many former colonies retain the common law system today. These common law systems are legal systems that give great weight to judicial precedent, and to the style of reasoning inherited from the English legal system.[10][11][12][13] Today, approximately one-third of the world's population lives in common law jurisdictions or in mixed legal systems that integrate common law and civil law.[14]\n\nTerminology\n\nAccording to Black's Law Dictionary, common law is \"the body of law derived from judicial decisions, rather than from statutes or constitutions.\"[15] Legal systems that rely on common law as precedent are known as \"common law jurisdictions.\"[15][11]\n\nUntil the early 20th century, common law was widely considered to derive its authority from ancient Anglo-Saxon customs. Well into the 19th century, common law was still defined as \"unwritten law\" (lex non scripta) in legal dictionaries including Bouvier's Law Dictionary and Black's Law Dictionary.[16] According to William Blackstone's declaratory theory the common law reaffirmed pre-existing customs but did not make new law. The term \"judge-made law\" was introduced by Jeremy Bentham as a criticism of this pretense of the legal profession.[17]\n\nMany notable writers, including A. V. Dicey, William Markby, Oliver Wendell Holmes, John Austin, Roscoe Pound, and Ezra Ripley Thayer, eventually adopted the modern definition of common law as \"case law\" or ratio decidendi, which serves as binding precedent.[17]\n\nBasic principles of common law\n\nCommon law adjudication\n\nIn a common law jurisdiction several stages of research and analysis are required to determine \"what the law is\" in a given situation.[18] First, one must ascertain the facts. Then, one must locate any relevant statutes and cases. Then one must extract the principles, analogies and statements by various courts of what they consider important to determine how the next court is likely to rule on the facts of the present case. More recent decisions, and decisions of higher courts or legislatures carry more weight than earlier cases and those of lower courts.[19] Finally, one integrates all the lines drawn and reasons given, and determines \"what the law is\". Then, one applies that law to the facts.\n\nIn practice, common law systems are considerably more complicated than the simplified system described above. The decisions of a court are binding only in a particular jurisdiction, and even within a given jurisdiction, some courts have more power than others. For example, in most jurisdictions, decisions by appellate courts are binding on lower courts in the same jurisdiction, and on future decisions of the same appellate court, but decisions of lower courts are only non-binding persuasive authority. Interactions between common law, constitutional law, statutory law and regulatory law also give rise to considerable complexity.\n\nCommon law evolves to meet changing social needs and improved understanding\n\n | This sectionpossibly containsoriginal research.Pleaseimprove itbyverifyingthe claims made and addinginline citations. Statements consisting only of original research should be removed.(February 2024)(Learn how and when to remove this message)\nOliver Wendell Holmes Jr. cautioned that \"the proper derivation of general principles in both common and constitutional law ... arise gradually, in the emergence of a consensus from a multitude of particularized prior decisions\".[20] Justice Cardozo noted the \"common law does not work from pre-established truths of universal and inflexible validity to conclusions derived from them deductively\", but \"[i]ts method is inductive, and it draws its generalizations from particulars\".[21]\n\nThe common law is more malleable than statutory law. First, common law courts are not absolutely bound by precedent, but can (when extraordinarily good reason is shown) reinterpret and revise the law, without legislative intervention, to adapt to new trends in political, legal and social philosophy. Second, the common law evolves through a series of gradual steps, that gradually works out all the details, so that over a decade or more, the law can change substantially but without a sharp break, thereby reducing disruptive effects.[22] In contrast to common law incrementalism, the legislative process is very difficult to get started, as the work begins much earlier than just introducing a bill. Once the legislation is introduced, the process to getting it passed is long, involving the committee system, debate, the potential of conference committee, voting, and President approval. Because of the involved process, many pieces must fall into place in order for it to be passed.[23]\n\nOne example of the gradual change that typifies evolution of the common law is the gradual change in liability for negligence. The traditional common law rule through most of the 19th century was that a plaintiff could not recover for a defendant's negligent production or distribution of a harmful instrumentality unless the two were parties to a contract (privity of contract). Thus, only the immediate purchaser could recover for a product defect, and if a part was built up out of parts from parts manufacturers, the ultimate buyer could not recover for injury caused by a defect in the part. In an 1842 English case, Winterbottom v Wright,[24] the postal service had contracted with Wright to maintain its coaches. Winterbottom was a driver for the post. When the coach failed and injured Winterbottom, he sued Wright. The Winterbottom court recognized that there would be \"absurd and outrageous consequences\" if an injured person could sue any person peripherally involved, and knew it had to draw a line somewhere, a limit on the causal connection between the negligent conduct and the injury. The court looked to the contractual relationships, and held that liability would only flow as far as the person in immediate contract (\"privity\") with the negligent party.\n\nA first exception to this rule arose in 1852, in the case of Thomas v. Winchester,[25] when New York's highest court held that mislabeling a poison as an innocuous herb, and then selling the mislabeled poison through a dealer who would be expected to resell it, put \"human life in imminent danger\". Thomas relied on this reason to create an exception to the \"privity\" rule. In 1909, New York held in Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co.",

      "raw_content": "Contents\n\nNatural law\n\nNatural law[1] (Latin: ius naturale, lex naturalis) is a philosophical and legal theory that posits the existence of a set of inherent laws derived from nature and universal moral principles, which are discoverable through reason. In ethics, natural law theory[2] asserts that certain rights and moral values are inherent in human nature and can be understood universally, independent of enacted laws or societal norms. In jurisprudence, natural law—sometimes referred to as iusnaturalism[3] or jusnaturalism,[4] but not to be confused with what is called simply naturalism in legal philosophy[5][6]—holds that there are objective legal standards based on morality that underlie and inform the creation, interpretation, and application of human-made laws. This contrasts with positive law (as in legal positivism),[7] which emphasizes that laws are rules created by human authorities and are not necessarily connected to moral principles. Natural law can refer to \"theories of ethics, theories of politics, theories of civil law, and theories of religious morality\",[8] depending on the context in which naturally-grounded practical principles are claimed to exist.\n\nIn Western tradition, natural law was anticipated by the pre-Socratics, for example, in their search for principles that governed the cosmos and human beings. The concept of natural law was documented in ancient Greek philosophy, including Aristotle,[9] and was mentioned in ancient Roman philosophy by Cicero. References to it are also found in the Old and New Testaments of the Bible, and were later expounded upon in the Middle Ages by Christian philosophers such as Albert the Great and Thomas Aquinas. The School of Salamanca made notable contributions during the Renaissance.\n\nAlthough the central ideas of natural law had been part of Christian thought since the Roman Empire, its foundation as a consistent system was laid by Aquinas, who synthesized and condensed his predecessors' ideas into his Lex Naturalis (lit. 'natural law').[10] Aquinas argues that because human beings have reason, and because reason is a spark of the divine, all human lives are sacred and of infinite value compared to any other created object, meaning everyone is fundamentally equal and bestowed with an intrinsic basic set of rights that no one can remove.\n\nModern natural law theory took shape in the Age of Enlightenment, combining inspiration from Roman law, Christian scholastic philosophy, and contemporary concepts such as social contract theory. It was used in challenging the theory of the divine right of kings, and became an alternative justification for the establishment of a social contract, positive law, and government—and thus legal rights—in the form of classical republicanism. John Locke was a key Enlightenment-era proponent of natural law, stressing its role in the justification of property rights and the right to revolution.[11] In the early decades of the 21st century, the concept of natural law is closely related to the concept of natural rights and has libertarian and conservative proponents.[12] Indeed, many philosophers, jurists and scholars use natural law synonymously with natural rights (Latin: ius naturale) or natural justice;[13] others distinguish between natural law and natural right.[14]\n\nSome scholars point out that the concept of natural law has been used by philosophers throughout history also in a different sense from those mentioned above, e.g. for the law of the strongest, which can be observed\nto hold among all members of the animal kingdom, or as the principle of self-preservation, inherent as an instinct in all living beings.[15]\n\nHistory\n\nAncient Greece\n\nPlato\n\nPlato did not have an explicit theory of natural law (he rarely used the phrase \"natural law\" except in Gorgias 484 and Timaeus 83e), but his concept of nature, according to John Wild, contains some of the elements of many natural law theories.[16] According to Plato, we live in an orderly universe.[17] The basis of this orderly universe or nature are the forms, most fundamentally the Form of the Good, which Plato calls \"the brightest region of Being\".[18] The Form of the Good is the cause of all things, and a person who sees it is led to act wisely.[19] In the Symposium, the Good is closely identified with the Beautiful,[20] and Plato describes how Socrates's experience of the Beautiful enabled him to resist the temptations of wealth and sex.[21] In the Republic, the ideal community is \"a city which would be established in accordance with nature\".[22]\n\nAristotle\n\nGreek philosophy emphasized the distinction between \"nature\" (physis, φúσις) and \"law\", \"custom\", or \"convention\" (nomos, νóμος).[citation needed] What the law commanded is expected to vary from place to place, but what is \"by nature\" should be the same everywhere. A \"law of nature\" therefore has the flavor more of a paradox than something that obviously existed.[14] Against the conventionalism that the distinction between nature and custom could engender, Socrates and his philosophic heirs, Plato and Aristotle, posited the existence of natural justice or natural right (Ancient Greek: dikaion physikon, δίκαιον φυσικόν, Latin: ius naturale). Of these, Aristotle is often said to be the father of natural law.[13]\n\nAristotle's association with natural law may be due to Thomas Aquinas's interpretation of his work.[23] But whether Aquinas correctly read Aristotle is in dispute.[citation needed] According to some, Aquinas conflates natural law and natural right, the latter of which Aristotle posits in Book V of the Nicomachean Ethics (Book IV of the Eudemian Ethics). According to this interpretation, Aquinas's influence was such as to affect a number of early translations of these passages in an unfortunate manner, though more recent translations render them more literally.[24] Aristotle notes that natural justice is a species of political justice, specifically the scheme of distributive and corrective justice that would be established under the best political community; if this took the form of law, it could be called a natural law, though Aristotle does not discuss this and suggests in the Politics that the best regime may not rule by law at all.[25]\n\nThe best evidence of Aristotle's having thought there is a natural law is in the Rhetoric, where Aristotle notes that, aside from the \"particular\" laws that each people has set up for itself, there is a \"common\" law that is according to nature.[26][edition needed] Specifically, he quotes Sophocles and Empedocles:\n\nUniversal law is the law of Nature. For there really is, as every one to some extent divines, a natural justice and injustice that is binding on all men, even on those who have no association or covenant with each other. It is this that Sophocles' Antigone clearly means when she says that the burial of Polyneices was a just act in spite of the prohibition: she means that it was just by nature:\n\n\"Not of to-day or yesterday it is,\nBut lives eternal: none can date its birth.\"\n\nAnd so Empedocles, when he bids us kill no living creature, he is saying that to do this is not just for some people, while unjust for others:\n\n\"Nay, but, an all-embracing law, through the realms of the sky\nUnbroken it stretcheth, and over the earth's immensity.\"[27]\n\nSome critics believe that this remark's context suggests only that Aristotle advised that it can be rhetorically advantageous to appeal to such a law, especially when the \"particular\" law of one's own city is averse to the case being made, not that there actually is such a law.[13] Moreover, they write that Aristotle considered two of the three candidates for a universally valid, natural law provided in this passage to be wrong.[14] Aristotle's paternity of natural law tradition is consequently disputed.\n\nStoic natural law\n\nThe development of this tradition of natural justice into one of natural law is usually attributed to the Stoics.",

      "raw_content": "Contents\n\nInternational law\n\nInternational law, also known as public international law, global law and the law of nations, is the set of rules, norms, legal customs and standards that states and other actors feel an obligation to, and generally do, obey in their mutual relations. In international relations, actors are simply the individuals and collective entities, such as states, international organizations, and non-state groups, which can make behavioral choices, whether lawful or unlawful. Rules are formal, typically written expectations that outline required behavior, while norms are informal, often unwritten guidelines about appropriate behavior that are shaped by custom and social practice.[1] It establishes norms for states across a broad range of domains, including war and diplomacy, economic relations, and human rights.\n\nInternational law differs from state-based domestic legal systems in that it operates largely through consent, since there is no universally accepted authority to enforce it upon sovereign states. States and non-state actors may choose to not abide by international law, and even to breach a treaty, but such violations, particularly of peremptory norms, can be met with disapproval by others and in some cases coercive action including diplomacy, economic sanctions, and war. The lack of a final authority in international law can also cause far reaching differences. This is partly the effect of states being able to interpret international law in a manner which they seem fit. This can lead to problematic stances which can have large local effects.[2]\n\nThe sources of international law include international custom (general state practice accepted as law), treaties, and general principles of law recognised by most national legal systems. Although international law may also be reflected in international comity—the practices adopted by states to maintain good relations and mutual recognition—such traditions are not legally binding. Since good relations are more important to maintain with more powerful states they can influence others more in the matter of what is legal and what not. This is because they can impose heavier consequences on other states which gives them a final say.[3] The relationship and interaction between a national legal system and international law is complex and variable. National law may become international law when treaties permit national jurisdiction to supranational tribunals such as the European Court of Human Rights or the International Criminal Court. Treaties such as the Geneva Conventions require national law to conform to treaty provisions. National laws or constitutions may also provide for the implementation or integration of international legal obligations into domestic law.\n\nTerminology\n\nThe modern term \"international law\" was originally coined by Jeremy Bentham in his 1789 book Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation to replace the older law of nations, a direct translation of the late medieval concepts of ius gentium, used by Hugo Grotius, and droits des gens, used by Emer de Vattel.[4][5] The definition of international law has been debated; Bentham referred specifically to relationships between states which has been criticised for its narrow scope.[6] Lassa Oppenheim defined it in his treatise as \"a law between sovereign and equal states based on the common consent of these states\" and this definition has been largely adopted by international legal scholars.[7]\n\nThere is a distinction between public and private international law; the latter is concerned with whether national courts can claim jurisdiction over cases with a foreign element and the application of foreign judgments in domestic law, whereas public international law covers rules with an international origin.[8] The difference between the two areas of law has been debated as scholars disagree about the nature of their relationship. Joseph Story, who originated the term \"private international law\", emphasised that it must be governed by the principles of public international law but other academics view them as separate bodies of law.[9][10] Another term, transnational law, is sometimes used to refer to a body of both national and international rules that transcend the nation state, although some academics emphasise that it is distinct from either type of law. It was defined by Philip Jessup as \"all law which regulates actions or events that transcend national frontiers\".[11]\n\nA more recent concept is supranational law, which was described in a 1969 paper as \"[a] relatively new word in the vocabulary of politics\".[12] Systems of supranational law arise when nations explicitly cede their right to make decisions to this system's judiciary and legislature, which then have the right to make laws that are directly effective in each member state.[12][13] This has been described as \"a level of international integration beyond mere intergovernmentalism yet still short of a federal system\".[12] The most common example of a supranational system is the European Union.[13]\n\nHistory\n\nWith origins tracing back to antiquity,[15] states have a long history of negotiating interstate agreements. An initial framework was conceptualised by the Ancient Romans and this idea of ius gentium has been used by various academics to establish the modern concept of international law. Among the earliest recorded examples are peace treaties between the Mesopotamian city-states of Lagash and Umma (approximately 3100 BCE), and an agreement between the Egyptian pharaoh, Ramesses II, and the Hittite king, Ḫattušili III, concluded in 1279 BCE.[14] Interstate pacts and agreements were negotiated and agreed upon by polities across the world, from the eastern Mediterranean to East Asia.[16] In Ancient Greece, many early peace treaties were negotiated between its city-states and, occasionally, with neighbouring states.[17] The Roman Empire established an early conceptual framework for international law, jus gentium, which governed the status of foreigners living in Rome and relations between foreigners and Roman citizens.[18][19] Adopting the Greek concept of natural law, the Romans conceived of jus gentium as being universal.[20] However, in contrast to modern international law, the Roman law of nations applied to relations with and between foreign individuals rather than among political units such as states.[21]\n\nBeginning with the Spring and Autumn period of the eighth century BCE, China was divided into numerous states that were often at war with each other. Rules for diplomacy and treaty-making emerged, including notions regarding just grounds for war, the rights of neutral parties, and the consolidation and partition of states; these concepts were sometimes applied to relations with barbarians along China's western periphery beyond the Central Plains.[22][23] The subsequent Warring States period saw the development of two major schools of thought, Confucianism and Legalism, both of which held that the domestic and international legal spheres were closely interlinked, and sought to establish competing normative principles to guide foreign relations.[23][24] Similarly, the Indian subcontinent was divided into various states, which over time developed rules of neutrality, treaty law, and international conduct, and established both temporary and permanent embassies.[25][26]\n\nFollowing the collapse of the western Roman Empire in the fifth century CE, Europe fragmented into numerous often-warring states for much of the next five centuries. Political power was dispersed across a range of entities, including the Church, mercantile city-states, and kingdoms, most of which had overlapping and ever-changing jurisdictions. As in China and India, these divisions prompted the development of rules aimed at providing stable and predictable relations.",

These laws, which provide the basis for Newtonian mechanics, can be paraphrased as follows:\n\nThe three laws of motion were first stated by Isaac Newton in his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), originally published in 1687.[3] Newton used them to investigate and explain the motion of many physical objects and systems.  In the time since Newton, new insights, especially around the concept of energy, built the field of classical mechanics on his foundations. Limitations to Newton's laws have also been discovered; new theories are necessary when objects move at very high speeds (special relativity), are very massive (general relativity), or are very small (quantum mechanics).\n\nPrerequisites\n\nNewton's laws are often stated in terms of point or particle masses, that is, bodies whose volume is negligible. This is a reasonable approximation for real bodies when the motion of internal parts can be neglected, and when the separation between bodies is much larger than the size of each. For instance, the Earth and the Sun can both be approximated as pointlike when considering the orbit of the former around the latter, but the Earth is not pointlike when considering activities on its surface.[note 1]\n\nThe mathematical description of motion, or kinematics, is based on the idea of specifying positions using numerical coordinates. Movement is represented by these numbers changing over time: a body's trajectory is represented by a function that assigns to each value of a time variable the values of all the position coordinates. The simplest case is one-dimensional, that is, when a body is constrained to move only along a straight line. Its position can then be given by a single number, indicating where it is relative to some chosen reference point. For example, a body might be free to slide along a track that runs left to right, and so its location can be specified by its distance from a convenient zero point, or origin, with negative numbers indicating positions to the left and positive numbers indicating positions to the right. If the body's location as a function of time is \n\n\n\ns\n(\nt\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s(t)}\n\n, then its average velocity over the time interval from \n\n\n\n\nt\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle t_{0}}\n\n to \n\n\n\n\nt\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle t_{1}}\n\n is[6] \n\n\n\n\n\n\nΔ\ns\n\n\nΔ\nt\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\ns\n(\n\nt\n\n1\n\n\n)\n−\ns\n(\n\nt\n\n0\n\n\n)\n\n\n\nt\n\n1\n\n\n−\n\nt\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\Delta s}{\\Delta t}}={\\frac {s(t_{1})-s(t_{0})}{t_{1}-t_{0}}}.}\n\nHere, the Greek letter \n\n\n\nΔ\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta }\n\n (delta) is used, per tradition, to mean \"change in\". A positive average velocity means that the position coordinate \n\n\n\ns\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s}\n\n increases over the interval in question, a negative average velocity indicates a net decrease over that interval, and an average velocity of zero means that the body ends the time interval in the same place as it began. Calculus gives the means to define an instantaneous velocity, a measure of a body's speed and direction of movement at a single moment of time, rather than over an interval. One notation for the instantaneous velocity is to replace \n\n\n\nΔ\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta }\n\n with the symbol \n\n\n\nd\n\n\n{\\displaystyle d}\n\n, for example,\n\n\n\nv\n=\n\n\n\nd\ns\n\n\nd\nt\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle v={\\frac {ds}{dt}}.}\n\nThis denotes that the instantaneous velocity is the derivative of the position with respect to time. It can roughly be thought of as the ratio between an infinitesimally small change in position \n\n\n\nd\ns\n\n\n{\\displaystyle ds}\n\n to the infinitesimally small time interval \n\n\n\nd\nt\n\n\n{\\displaystyle dt}\n\n over which it occurs.[7] More carefully, the velocity and all other derivatives can be defined using the concept of a limit.[6] A function \n\n\n\nf\n(\nt\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f(t)}\n\n has a limit of \n\n\n\nL\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L}\n\n at a given input value \n\n\n\n\nt\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle t_{0}}\n\n if the difference between \n\n\n\nf\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f}\n\n and \n\n\n\nL\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L}\n\n can be made arbitrarily small by choosing an input sufficiently close to \n\n\n\n\nt\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle t_{0}}\n\n. One writes, \n\n\n\n\nlim\n\nt\n→\n\nt\n\n0\n\n\n\n\nf\n(\nt\n)\n=\nL\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\lim _{t\\to t_{0}}f(t)=L.}\n\nInstantaneous velocity can be defined as the limit of the average velocity as the time interval shrinks to zero:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd\ns\n\n\nd\nt\n\n\n\n=\n\nlim\n\nΔ\nt\n→\n0\n\n\n\n\n\ns\n(\nt\n+\nΔ\nt\n)\n−\ns\n(\nt\n)\n\n\nΔ\nt\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {ds}{dt}}=\\lim _{\\Delta t\\to 0}{\\frac {s(t+\\Delta t)-s(t)}{\\Delta t}}.}\n\n Acceleration is to velocity as velocity is to position: it is the derivative of the velocity with respect to time.[note 2] Acceleration can likewise be defined as a limit:\n\n\n\na\n=\n\n\n\nd\nv\n\n\nd\nt\n\n\n\n=\n\nlim\n\nΔ\nt\n→\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nv\n(\nt\n+\nΔ\nt\n)\n−\nv\n(\nt\n)\n\n\nΔ\nt\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a={\\frac {dv}{dt}}=\\lim _{\\Delta t\\to 0}{\\frac {v(t+\\Delta t)-v(t)}{\\Delta t}}.}\n\nConsequently, the acceleration is the second derivative of position,[7] often written \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd\n\n2\n\n\ns\n\n\nd\n\nt\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {d^{2}s}{dt^{2}}}}\n\n.\n\nPosition, when thought of as a displacement from an origin point, is a vector: a quantity with both magnitude and direction.[9]: 1  Velocity and acceleration are vector quantities as well. The mathematical tools of vector algebra provide the means to describe motion in two, three or more dimensions. Vectors are often denoted with an arrow, as in  \n\n\n\n\n\n\ns\n→\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\vec {s}}}\n\n, or in bold typeface, such as \n\n\n\n\n\ns\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\bf {s}}}\n\n. Often, vectors are represented visually as arrows, with the direction of the vector being the direction of the arrow, and the magnitude of the vector indicated by the length of the arrow. Numerically, a vector can be represented as a list; for example, a body's velocity vector might be \n\n\n\n\nv\n\n=\n(\n\n3\n \nm\n\n/\n\ns\n\n,\n\n4\n \nm\n\n/\n\ns\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {v} =(\\mathrm {3~m/s} ,\\mathrm {4~m/s} )}\n\n, indicating that it is moving at 3 metres per second along the horizontal axis and 4 metres per second along the vertical axis. The same motion described in a different coordinate system will be represented by different numbers, and vector algebra can be used to translate between these alternatives.[9]: 4\n\nThe study of mechanics is complicated by the fact that household words like energy are used with a technical meaning.",

      "raw_content": "common law\n\nOur editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article.\n\ncommon law,  the body of customary law, based upon judicial decisions and embodied in reports of decided cases, that has been administered by the common-law courts of England since the Middle Ages. From it has evolved the type of legal system now found also in the United States and in most of the member states of the Commonwealth (formerly the British Commonwealth of Nations). In this sense common law stands in contrast to the legal system derived from civil law, now widespread in continental Europe and elsewhere. In another, narrower, sense, common law is contrasted to the rules applied in English and American courts of equity and also to statute law. A standing expository difficulty is that, whereas the United Kingdom is a unitary state in international law, it comprises three major (and other minor) legal systems, those of England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Historically, the common-law system in England (applied to Wales since 1536) has directly influenced that in Ireland but only partially influenced the distinct legal system in Scotland, which is therefore, except as regards international matters, not covered in this article. Beginning in 1973 the legal systems in the United Kingdom experienced integration into the system of European Union (EU) law, which had direct effects upon the domestic law of its constituent states—the majority of which had domestic systems that were influenced by the civil-law tradition and that cultivated a more purposive technique of legislative interpretation than was customary in the English common law. However, the United Kingdom exited the EU in 2020. The regime of human rights represented by the European Convention on Human Rights (1950) has exercised a similar influence in the United Kingdom since the passage by Parliament of the Human Rights Act 1998.\n\nThe origin of the common law\n\nThe English common law originated in the early Middle Ages in the King’s Court (Curia Regis), a single royal court set up for most of the country at Westminster, near London. Like many other early legal systems, it did not originally consist of substantive rights but rather of procedural remedies. The working out of these remedies has, over time, produced the modern system in which rights are seen as primary over procedure. Until the late 19th century, English common law continued to be developed primarily by judges rather than legislators.\n\nThe common law of England was largely created in the period after the Norman Conquest of 1066. The Anglo-Saxons, especially after the accession of Alfred the Great (871), had developed a body of rules resembling those being used by the Germanic peoples of northern Europe. Local customs governed most matters, while the church played a large part in government. Crimes were treated as wrongs for which compensation was made to the victim.\n\nThe Norman Conquest did not bring an immediate end to Anglo-Saxon law, but a period of colonial rule by the mainly Norman conquerors produced change. Land was allocated to feudal vassals of the king, many of whom had joined the conquest with this reward in mind. Serious wrongs were regarded mainly as public crimes rather than as personal matters, and the perpetrators were punished by death and forfeiture of property. The requirement that, in cases of sudden death, the local community should identify the body as English (“presentment of Englishry”)—and, therefore, of little account—or face heavy fines reveals a state of unrest between the Norman conquerors and their English subjects. Government was centralized, a bureaucracy built up, and written records maintained. Controversy exists regarding the extent to which the efficient government of the Anglo-Norman realm was due to the legacy of Anglo-Saxon institutions or to the ruthlessness of the Norman invaders. Elements of the Anglo-Saxon system that survived were the jury, ordeals (trials by physical test or combat), the practice of outlawry (putting a person beyond the protection of the law), and writs (orders requiring a person to appear before a court; see below The development of a centralized judiciary). Important consolidation occurred during the reign of Henry II (1154–89). Royal officials roamed the country, inquiring about the administration of justice. Church and state were separate and had their own law and court systems. This led to centuries of rivalry over jurisdiction, especially since appeals from church courts, before the Reformation, could be taken to Rome.\n\nThe Normans spoke French and had developed a customary law in Normandy. They had no professional lawyers or judges; instead, literate clergymen acted as administrators. Some of the clergy were familiar with Roman law and the canon law of the Christian church, which was developed in the universities of the 12th century. Canon law was applied in the English church courts, but the revived Roman law was less influential in England than elsewhere, despite Norman dominance in government. This was due largely to the early sophistication of the Anglo-Norman system. Norman custom was not simply transplanted to England; upon its arrival, a new body of rules, based on local conditions, emerged.\n\n",

      "raw_content": "Strategic management\n\nIn the field of management, strategic management involves the formulation and implementation of the major goals and initiatives taken by an organization's  managers on behalf of stakeholders, based on consideration of resources and an assessment of the internal and external environments in which the organization operates.[1][2][3][4] Strategic management provides overall direction to an enterprise and involves specifying the organization's objectives, developing policies and plans to achieve those objectives, and then allocating resources to implement the plans.[5] Academics and practicing managers have developed numerous models and frameworks to assist in strategic decision-making in the context of complex environments and competitive dynamics.[6] Strategic management is not static in nature; the models can include a feedback loop to monitor execution and to inform the next round of planning.[7][8][9]\n\nMichael Porter identifies three principles underlying strategy:[10]\n\nCorporate strategy involves answering a key question from a portfolio perspective: \"What business should we be in?\" Business strategy involves answering the question: \"How shall we compete in this business?\"[11][12] Alternatively, corporate strategy may be thought of as the strategic management of a corporation (a particular legal structure of a business), and business strategy as the strategic management of a business.\n\nManagement theory and practice often make a distinction between strategic management and operational management, where operational management is concerned primarily with improving efficiency and controlling costs within the boundaries set by the organization's strategy.[citation needed]\n\nContents\n\nDefinitions\n\nStrategy has been practiced whenever an advantage was gained by planning the sequence and timing of the deployment of resources while simultaneously taking into account the probable capabilities and behavior of competition.\n\nIn 1988, Henry Mintzberg described the many different definitions and perspectives on strategy reflected in both academic research and in practice.[14][15] He examined the strategic process and concluded it was much more fluid and unpredictable than people had thought. Because of this, he could not point to one process that could be called strategic planning. Instead Mintzberg concludes that there are five types of strategies:\n\nIn 1998, Mintzberg developed these five types of management strategy into 10 \"schools of thought\" and grouped them into three categories. The first group is normative. It consists of the schools of informal design and conception, the formal planning, and analytical positioning. The second group, consisting of six schools, is more concerned with how strategic management is actually done, rather than prescribing optimal plans or positions. The six schools are entrepreneurial, visionary, cognitive, learning/adaptive/emergent, negotiation, corporate culture and business environment. The third and final group consists of one school, the configuration or transformation school, a hybrid of the other schools organized into stages, organizational life cycles, or \"episodes\".[16]\n\nMichael Porter defined strategy in 1980 as the \"...broad formula for how a business is going to compete, what its goals should be, and what policies will be needed to carry out those goals\" and the \"...combination of the ends (goals) for which the firm is striving and the means (policies) by which it is seeking to get there.\" He continued that: \"The essence of formulating competitive strategy is relating a company to its environment.\"[17]\n\nSome complexity theorists define strategy as the unfolding of the internal and external aspects of the organization that results in actions in a socio-economic context.[18][19][20]\n\nMichael D. Watkins (2007) argued that strategic management operates as a critical bridge between an organization's mission, vision, and execution. He asserted that if the mission statement and goals answer the 'what' question, and if the vision statement answers the 'why' questions, then strategy provides answers to the 'how' question of business management. In other words, strategy encompasses the methods, frameworks, and decision-making processes that enable a company to translate its aspirations into concrete actions and competitive success.[21]\n\nApplication\n\nStrategy is defined as \"the determination of the basic long-term goals of an enterprise, and the adoption of courses of action and the allocation of resources necessary for carrying out these goals\".[22] Strategies are established to set direction, focus effort, define or clarify the organization, and provide consistency or guidance in response to the environment.[23]\n\nStrategic management involves the related concepts of strategic planning and strategic thinking. Strategic planning is analytical in nature and refers to formalized procedures to produce the data and analyses used as inputs for strategic thinking, which synthesizes the data resulting in the strategy. Strategic planning may also refer to control mechanisms used to implement the strategy once it is determined. In other words, strategic planning happens around the strategic thinking or strategy making activity.[24]\n\nStrategic management is often described as involving two major processes: formulation and implementation of strategy. While described sequentially below, in practice the two processes are iterative and each provides input for the other.[24]\n\nFormulation\n\nFormulation of strategy involves analyzing the environment in which the organization operates, then making a series of strategic decisions about how the organization will fulfill its mission. Formulation ends with a series of goals or objectives and measures for the organization to pursue. Environmental analysis includes the:\n\nStrategic decisions are based on insight from the environmental assessment and are responses to strategic questions about how the organization will compete, such as:\n\nThe answers to these and many other strategic questions result in the organization's strategy and a series of specific short-term and long-term goals or objectives and related measures.[24]\n\nImplementation\n\nThe second major process of strategic management is implementation, which involves decisions regarding how the organization's resources (i.e., people, process and IT systems) will be aligned and mobilized towards the objectives. Implementation results in how the organization's resources are structured (such as by product or service or geography), leadership arrangements, communication, incentives, and monitoring mechanisms to track progress towards objectives, among others.[24]\n\nRunning the day-to-day operations of the business is often referred to as \"operations management\" or specific terms for key departments or functions, such as \"logistics management\" or \"marketing management\", which take over once strategic management decisions are implemented.[24]\n\nHistorical development\n\nOrigins\n\nThe strategic management discipline originated in the 1950s and 1960s. Among the numerous early contributors, the most influential were Peter Drucker, Philip Selznick, Alfred Chandler, Igor Ansoff,[26] and Bruce Henderson.[6] The discipline draws from earlier thinking and texts on 'strategy' dating back thousands of years. Prior to 1960, the term \"strategy\" was primarily used regarding war and politics, not business.[27] Many companies built strategic planning functions to develop and execute the formulation and implementation processes during the 1960s.[28]\n\nPeter Drucker was a prolific management theorist and author of dozens of management books, with a career spanning five decades. He addressed fundamental strategic questions in a 1954 book The Practice of Management writing: \"... the first responsibility of top management is to ask the question 'what is our business?' and to make sure it is carefully studied and correctly answered.",

This can look like:\n\n\n\nCreating goals and objectives\n\nEstablishing schedules\n\nDeveloping strategies to increase performance, productivity, and efficiency\n\nEnsuring compliance with company policies and industry regulations\n\nMentoring employees\n\nMonitoring budgets, productivity levels, and performance\n\nResolving customer problems\n\nTraining staff\n\n\n\n4 key functions of a manager\n\nManagers have several functions within an organization. You'll usually see these functions divided into four interconnected groups. Understanding them can help you identify your strengths and areas of need so that you can choose the proper training to improve your skills.\n\n1. Planning\n\nThe first function of a manager is to set goals. These goals may be for individual employees, departments, or the entire organization, depending on the manager's level of responsibility. In addition to setting goals, managers often develop action items along with strategies and resources to complete tasks and meet goals.Â\n\n2. Organizing\n\nMeeting organizational goals requires putting the right people in the right places. Managers can play an important role in choosing workers for positions and projects. Knowing how to group people and help them build relationships often significantly affects how well the group works together. Sometimes managers need to train employees for specific tasks to ensure they have the knowledge and skills they need to succeed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Motivating\n\nManagers help motivate employees to show up and stay productive. This includes sharing a common vision, encouraging them to develop their strengths, and inspiring them to do their best work at all times. Having effective communication skills is essential for filling this role.Â\n\n4. Evaluating\n\nManagers typically spend time measuring the success of their teams and how well they meet goals. The more they understand what works and doesn't work, the better prepared they are to make decisions in the future. Managers must understand and adjust strategies to meet company goals.\n\nWatch this video on the process of performance management, an important part of helping employees reach their potential:\n\n\n\nRead more: What Is Management Science? + How to Enter This Field\n\n\n\n5 management styles\n\nThe way you choose to manage your team or department can have a direct effect on how they meet their goals. What you say and do may send powerful messages to employees about how you value their contributions and your level of trust in them. The list below highlights some of the more common styles used by managers.\n\n1. Authoritative\n\nAuthoritative leaders tend to make decisions without feedback from others. This approach works well when you need to respond quickly to a situation and don't have time for debate. If you rely on this approach too much, you may see high levels of turnover within the organization and stalled innovation.\n\n2. Coaching\n\nSome managers view their role as that of a coach who sees the potential in employees and wants to help them grow. This can effectively build strong teams and create an environment where employees feel comfortable experimenting. Employees typically have a sense of autonomy under this style, but those needing more direction may feel neglected.\n\n3. Democratic\n\nDemocratic managers value the input of employees in the decision-making process and usually believe having more ideas is better than having a few. This management style may help empower and motivate employees to work toward common goals. However, sorting through all of the voices and finding a consensus to make a decision can take time.\n\n4. Transformational\n\nIn a transformational management style, managers prioritize innovation and growth. These managers encourage employees to discover just what they're capable of achieving. Workers with transformational leaders tend to be happy and dedicated to their work, but they must be able to adapt to sudden changes.\n\n5. Visionary\n\nA visionary leader knows how to ensure every team member understands the company's vision and is working toward a common goal. These leaders tend to be excellent communicators and typically give workers plenty of autonomy as long as they effectively execute the vision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevels of management\n\nIn many organizations, management falls into one of three levels: top, middle, and low. Managers in smaller companies may fill roles at more than one level, while larger organizations may have several managers within each level.\n\n\n\nTop: Top-level management typically has an administrative role, and their decisions affect the entire organization even though they sometimes arenât involved in the day-to-day operations. They may have the title of chief executive officer (CEO) or serve on the board of directors.\n\n\n\nMiddle: You find people with executive roles at the middle management level. They work with both top-level management and supervisors to help workers meet objectives and boost the company's productivity. At this level, they may be called regional managers or general managers.\n\n\n\nLow: The final level of management often has a supervisory role. These managers have titles like shift supervisor, branch manager, or team leader. They work with individuals and teams to meet goals determined by upper management. They typically have less influence over company policy compared to the other management levels, but the most interaction with direct reports.\n\nRead more: 11 Key Project Management Skills\n\nCareers in management\n\nManagers work in almost every type of company and industry. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) expects management positions to grow faster than average by 2032 as entrepreneurs start new companies and existing organizations expand their operations [1]. The following management job titles show how varied these positions can be.\n\nAdvertising, promotions, and marketing managers\n\nMedian annual salary (US): $138,730 [2]\n\nJob outlook (projected growth from 2022 to 2032): 6 percentÂ\n\n\n\nAs an advertising, promotions, or marketing manager, you help companies promote their products and services through strategic campaigns. You'll typically need a bachelor's in marketing, communications, or business to qualify for this type of position. Before becoming a manager, you may build work experience as a sales representative, social media specialist, marketing assistant, or public relations specialist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstruction managers\n\nMedian annual salary (US): $101,480 [3]\n\nJob outlook (projected growth from 2022 to 2032): 5 percentÂ\n\nConstruction managers typically divide their time between the office and a construction site.

      "raw_content": "Contents\n\nForest management\n\nForest management is a branch of forestry concerned with overall administrative, legal, economic, and social aspects, as well as scientific and technical aspects, such as silviculture, forest protection, and forest regulation. This includes management for timber, aesthetics, recreation, urban values, water, wildlife, inland and nearshore fisheries, wood products, plant genetic resources, and other forest resource values.[1] Management objectives can be for conservation, utilisation, or a mixture of the two. Techniques include timber extraction, planting and replanting of different species, building and maintenance of roads and pathways through forests, and preventing fire.\n\nMany tools like remote sensing, GIS and photogrammetry[2][3] modelling have been developed to improve forest inventory and management planning.[4] Scientific research plays a crucial role in helping forest management. For example, climate modeling,[5][6][7] biodiversity research,[8][9] carbon sequestration research,[6][10][11] GIS applications,[12][13] and long-term monitoring[7][14] help assess and improve forest management, ensuring its effectiveness and success.\n\nRole of forests\n\nThe forest is a natural system that can supply different products and services. Forests supply water, mitigate climate change, provide habitats for wildlife including many pollinators which are essential for sustainable food production, provide timber and fuelwood, serve as a source of non-wood forest products including food and medicine, and contribute to rural livelihoods.[15]\n\nForests include market and non-market products. Marketable products include goods that have a market price. Timber is the main one, with prices that range from a few hundred dollars per thousand board feet (MBF) to several thousand dollars for a veneer log. Others include grazing and fodder, specialty crops such as mushrooms or berries, usage fees for recreation or hunting, and biomass for bioenergy production. Forests also provide some non-market values which have no current market price. Examples of non-market goods would be improving water quality, air quality, aesthetics, and carbon sequestration.\n\nThe working of this system is influenced by the natural environment: climate, topography, soil, etc., and also by human activity. The actions of humans in forests constitute forest management.[16] In developed societies, this management tends to be elaborated and planned in order to achieve the objectives that are considered desirable.[citation needed]\n\nAims\n\nSome forests have been and are managed to obtain traditional forest products such as firewood, fiber for paper, and timber, with little thinking for other products and services. Nevertheless, as a result of the progression of environmental awareness, management of forests for multiple use is becoming more common.[17]\n\nForests provide a variety of ecosystem services: cleaning the air, accumulating carbon, filtering water, and reducing flooding and erosion.[18] Forests are the most biodiverse land-based ecosystem, and provide habitat for a vast array of animals, birds, plants and other life. They can provide food and material and also opportunities for recreation and education. Research has found that forest plantations \"may result in reduced diversity and abundance of pollinators compared with natural forests that have greater structural and plant species diversity.\"[19]\n\nMonitoring and planning\n\nForesters develop and implement forest management plans relying on mapped resources, inventories showing an area's topographical features as well as its distribution of trees (by species) and other plant covers. Plans also include landowner objectives, roads, culverts, proximity to human habitation, water features and hydrological conditions, and soil information. Forest management plans typically include recommended silvicultural treatments and a timetable for their implementation. Application of digital maps in Geographic Information systems (GIS) that extracts and integrates different information about forest terrains, soil type and tree covers, etc. using, e.g. laser scanning enhances forest management plans in modern systems.[20]\n\nForest management plans include recommendations to achieve the landowner's objectives and desired future conditions for the property subject to ecological, financial, logistical (e.g. access to resources), and other constraints.  On some properties, plans focus on producing quality wood products for processing or sale. Hence, tree species, quantity, and form, all central to the value of harvested products quality and quantity, tend to be important components of silvicultural plans.\n\nGood management plans include consideration of future conditions of the stand after any recommended harvests treatments, including future treatments (particularly in intermediate stand treatments), and plans for natural or artificial regeneration after final harvests.\n\nThe objectives of landowners and leaseholders influence plans for harvest and subsequent site treatment. In Britain, plans featuring \"good forestry practice\" must always consider the needs of other stakeholders such as nearby communities or rural residents living within or adjacent to woodland areas. Foresters consider tree felling and environmental legislation when developing plans. Plans instruct the sustainable harvesting and replacement of trees.[21] They indicate whether road building or other forest engineering operations are required.\n\nAgriculture and forest leaders are also trying to understand how the climate change legislation will affect what they do. The information gathered will provide the data that will determine the role of agriculture and forestry in a new climate change regulatory system.[22]\n\nForest inventory\n\nForest inventory is the systematic collection of data and forest information for assessment or analysis. An estimate of the value and possible uses of timber is an important part of the broader information required to sustain ecosystems.[23][24] When taking forest inventory the following are important things to measure and note: species, diameter at breast height (DBH), height, site quality, age, and defects. From the data collected one can calculate the number of trees per acre, the basal area, the volume of trees in an area, and the value of the timber. Inventories can be done for other reasons than just calculating the value. A forest can be cruised to visually assess timber and determine potential fire hazards and the risk of fire.[25] The results of this type of inventory can be used in preventive actions and also awareness. Wildlife surveys can be undertaken in conjunction with timber inventory to determine the number and type of wildlife within a forest.\n\nWildlife considerations\n\nThe abundance and diversity of birds, mammals, amphibians and other wildlife are affected by strategies and types of forest management.[26] Forests are important because they provide these species with food, space and water.[27] Forest management is also important as it helps in conservation and utilization of the forest resources.Forest clearing to aid specific species of wildlife has been criticized because it can fragment forests leading to deleterious effects.[28][citation needed]\n\nApproximately 50 million hectares (or 24%) of European forest land is protected for biodiversity and landscape protection. Forests allocated for soil, water, and other ecosystem services encompass around 72 million hectares (32% of European forest area).[29][30][31] Over 90% of the world's forests regenerate organically, and more than half are covered by forest management plans or equivalents.[29][32]\n\nManagement intensity\n\nForest management varies in intensity from a leave alone, natural situation to a highly intensive regime with silvicultural interventions.",

This involves determining how to use the resource today while maintaining its health, productivity, and benefits for the future, integrating various factors and stakeholder needs.",

Supply Chain Management draws heavily from the areas of operations management, logistics, procurement, and information technology, and strives for an integrated approach.",
      "raw_content": "Supply chain management\n\nIn commerce, supply chain management (SCM) deals with a system of procurement (purchasing raw materials/components), operations management, logistics and marketing channels, through which raw materials can be developed into finished products and delivered to their end customers.[2][3] A more narrow definition of supply chain management is the \"design, planning, execution, control, and monitoring of supply chain activities with the objective of creating net value, building a competitive infrastructure, leveraging worldwide logistics, synchronising supply with demand and measuring performance globally\".[4][5] This can include the movement and storage of raw materials, work-in-process inventory, finished goods, and end to end order fulfilment from the point of origin to the point of consumption. Interconnected, interrelated or interlinked networks, channels and node businesses combine in the provision of products and services required by end customers in a supply chain.[6]\n\nSCM is the broad range of activities required to plan, control and execute a product's flow from materials to production to distribution in the most economical way possible. SCM encompasses the integrated planning and execution of processes required to optimize the flow of materials, information and capital in functions that broadly include demand planning, sourcing, production, inventory management and logistics—or storage and transportation.[7]\n\nSupply chain management strives for an integrated, multidisciplinary, multimethod approach.[8] Current [when?] research in supply chain management is concerned with topics related to resilience, sustainability, and risk management,[9] among others. Some suggest that the \"people dimension\" of SCM, ethical issues, internal integration, transparency/visibility, and human capital/talent management are topics that have, so far, been underrepresented on the research agenda.[10]\n\nContents\n\nMission\n\nSupply chain management, techniques with the aim of coordinating all parts of SC, from supplying raw materials to delivering and/or resumption of products, tries to minimize total costs with respect to existing conflicts among the chain partners. An example of these conflicts is the interrelation between the sale department desiring to have higher inventory levels to fulfill demands and the warehouse for which lower inventories are desired to reduce holding costs.[11]\n\nOrigin of the term and definitions\n\nIn 1982, Keith Oliver, a consultant at Booz Allen Hamilton, introduced the term \"supply chain management\" to the public domain in an interview for the Financial Times.[12] In 1983 WirtschaftsWoche in Germany published for the first time the results of an implemented and so called \"Supply Chain Management project\", led by Wolfgang Partsch.[13]\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the term \"supply chain management\" gained popularity when a flurry of articles and books came out on the subject. Supply chains were originally defined as encompassing all activities associated with the flow and transformation of goods from raw materials through to the end user or final consumer, as well as the associated information flows. Mentzer et al. consider it worthy of note that the final consumer was included within these early definitions.[14]: 2  Supply chain management was then further defined as the integration of supply chain activities through improved supply chain relationships to achieve a competitive advantage.[12]\n\nIn the late 1990s, \"supply chain management\" (SCM) rose to prominence, and operations managers began to use it in their titles with increasing regularity.[15][16][17] A supply chain, as opposed to supply chain management, is a set of firms who move materials \"forward\",[18] or a set of organizations, directly linked by one or more upstream and downstream flows of products, services, finances, or information from a source to a customer. Supply chain management is the management of such a chain.[14]\n\nOther commonly accepted definitions of supply chain management include:\n\nMentzer et al. make a further distinction between \"supply chain management\" and a \"supply chain orientation\". The latter term involves a recognition that a business strategy cannot be fulfilled without managing the activities of suppliers and customers upstream and downstream, whereas the former term is used for \"the actual implementation of this orientation\".[14]\n\nSupply chain visibility, in its origins, was concerned with knowledge of the location, production stage and expected delivery date of incoming products and materials, so that production could be planned,[24] but the development of the term has enabled it to be used to plan orders using knowledge of potential supplies, and to track post-production processes as far as delivery to customers.[25] The UK Government also uses the term \"supply chain visibility\" in conjunction with its mandate to ensure that potential suppliers have visibility into future supply opportunities. The government's action note on supply chain visibility covers obligations and appropriate contractual wording requiring prime suppliers to advertise sub-contracting opportunities and to report on their spend with small and medium-sized enterprises and voluntary/community organisations within their supply chains.[26]\n\nSupply chain management software includes tools or modules used to execute supply chain transactions, manage supplier relationships, and control associated business processes.[27] The overall goal of the software is to improve supply chain performance by monitoring a company's supply chain network from end-to-end (suppliers, transporters, returns, warehouses, retailers, manufacturers, and customers).[27]\n\nIn some cases, a supply chain includes the collection of goods after consumer use for recycling or the reverse logistics processes for returning faulty or unwanted products back to producers up the value chain.[28]\n\nFunctions\n\nSupply chain management is a cross-functional approach that includes managing the movement of raw materials into an organization, certain aspects of the internal processing of materials into finished goods, and the movement of finished goods out of the organization and toward the end consumer. As organizations strive to focus on core competencies and become more flexible, they reduce ownership of raw materials sources and distribution channels. These functions are increasingly being outsourced to other firms that can perform the activities better or more cost effectively. The effect is to increase the number of organizations involved in satisfying customer demand, while reducing managerial control of daily logistics operations. Less control and more supply chain partners lead to the creation of the concept of supply chain management.[29] Supply chain management is concerned with improving trust and collaboration among supply chain partners, thus improving inventory visibility and the velocity of inventory movement.[30][31]\n\nImportance\n\nOrganizations increasingly find that they must rely on effective supply chains, or networks, to compete in the global market and networked economy.[32] In Peter Drucker's (1998) new management paradigms, this concept of business relationships extends beyond traditional enterprise boundaries and seeks to organize entire business processes throughout a value chain of multiple companies. According to Drucker, \"the greatest change in corporate culture—and the way business is being conducted—may be the accelerated growth of relationships based not on ownership, but on partnership.\"[33] This approach allows companies to leverage the strengths and capabilities of various partners to achieve greater efficiency and innovation, ultimately enhancing overall business performance.",

These activities are different from operative functions like marketing, finance, purchase etc. Rather these activities are common to each and every manger irrespective of his level or status.\nDifferent experts have classified functions of management.\nAccording to George & Jerry, “There are four fundamental functions of management i.e. planning, organizing, actuating and controlling”.\nAccording to Henry Fayol, “To manage is to forecast and plan, to organize, to command, & to control”.\nWhereas Luther Gullick has given a keyword ’POSDCORB’ where P stands for Planning, O for Organizing, S for Staffing, D for Directing, Co for Co-ordination, R for reporting & B for Budgeting.\nBut the most widely accepted are functions of management given by KOONTZ and O’DONNEL i.e. Planning, Organizing, Staffing, Directing and Controlling.\nFor theoretical purposes, it may be convenient to separate the function of management but practically these functions are overlapping in nature i.e. they are highly inseparable. Each function blends into the other & each affects the performance of others.\n\n\nPlanning\nIt is the basic function of management. It deals with chalking out a future course of action & deciding in advance the most appropriate course of actions for achievement of pre-determined goals.\nAccording to KOONTZ, “Planning is deciding in advance - what to do, when to do & how to do. It bridges the gap from where we are & where we want to be”.\nA plan is a future course of actions. It is an exercise in problem solving & decision making.\nPlanning is determination of courses of action to achieve desired goals. Thus, planning is a systematic thinking about ways & means for accomplishment of pre-determined goals.\nPlanning is necessary to ensure proper utilization of human & non-human resources. It is all pervasive, it is an intellectual activity and it also helps in avoiding confusion, uncertainties, risks, wastages etc.\nKnow more about - Planning Function of Management\nOrganizing\nIt is the process of bringing together physical, financial and human resources and developing productive relationship amongst them for achievement of organizational goals.\nAccording to Henry Fayol, “To organize a business is to provide it with everything useful or its functioning i.e. raw material, tools, capital and personnel’s”.\nTo organize a business involves determining & providing human and non-human resources to the organizational structure.

In many of these relations, managers deal directly with their associates. In some companies, however, employees are represented by unions, meaning that managers bargain with representative associations. Such collective-bargaining relationships are generally described as labour relations.\n\nCurrent practice shows wide variation in the range of responsibilities assigned to human resource or industrial-relations departments. Personnel responsibilities typically include: (1) organizing—devising and revising organizational structures of authority and functional responsibility and facilitating two-way, reciprocal, vertical, and horizontal communication; (2) planning—forecasting personnel requirements in terms of numbers and special qualifications, scheduling inputs, and anticipating the need for appropriate managerial policies and programs; (3) staffing, or manning—analyzing jobs, developing job descriptions and specifications, appraising and maintaining an inventory of available capabilities, recruiting, selecting, placing, transferring, demoting, promoting, and thus assuring qualified manpower when and where it is needed; (4) training and development—assisting team members in their continuing personal growth, from pre-employment, preparatory job training to executive development programs; (5) collective bargaining—negotiating agreements and following through in day-to-day administration; (6) rewarding—providing financial and nonfinancial incentives for individual commitment and contribution; (7) general administration—developing appropriate styles and patterns of leadership throughout the organization; (8) auditing, reviewing, and researching—evaluating current performance and procedures in order to facilitate control and improve future practice.\n\nExamples of specific tasks include monitoring grievance settlements, maintaining safety and accident control programs, administering employee benefits and services, forecasting future personnel requirements, recommending changes in organizational structures, supervising formal in-house communication, conducting employee attitude and morale surveys, and overseeing compliance with legal requirements for the employment relationship.\n\nIndividual human resource or personnel departments may be assigned varying degrees of responsibility in a few, many, or all of these areas. In areas assigned to them, personnel departments exercise various levels of authority. Some officers and departments create policies and make major decisions and determinations, while others make less significant contributions. The person in charge of human resources may be a member of a company’s executive committee; if so, he or she may be expected to lead and assume responsibility for all manpower management policy and programs. Other personnel departments are essentially “staff,” or advisory; their activities are restricted to recommending, consulting, and providing such specified technical and professional services as are requested by operating managers.\n\n",

      "raw_content": "What Is Strategic Management?\n\nInvestopedia / Alex Dos Diaz\n\nStrategic management strategies help companies restructure, set new goals, implement revised approaches, and determine results.\n\nWhat Is Strategic Management?\n\nStrategic management evaluates and may reorganize company resources to achieve new goals and objectives. Strategic management looks at the competitive environment and internal organization, evaluates strategies, and ensures that management rolls out new approaches across the company.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nManagement Styles\n\nOrganizational leaders commonly focus on learning from past strategies and examining the current environment. Strategic management may include an analytic process, where all threats and opportunities are accounted for, or merely applying new guiding principles.\n\nThe skills and competencies of employees, business culture, and organizational structure influence how an organization can achieve its objectives. Inflexible companies may find it difficult to succeed in a changing business environment. Creating a barrier between strategies and their implementation can make it difficult for managers to determine whether objectives have been efficiently met.\n\nWhile an organization’s upper management is ultimately responsible for its strategy, the strategies are often sparked by actions and ideas from lower-level managers and employees. An organization may have several employees devoted to strategy, rather than relying solely on the chief executive officer (CEO) for guidance.\n\nImportant\n\nParticipative leadership occurs when management includes team members in the strategic decision-making process.\n\n\n\nStrategic Management Steps\n\nStrategic management helps organizations turn visions into action to reach business goals and objectives. A prescriptive approach outlines how strategies are developed, while a descriptive approach focuses on how they are implemented. Most organizations generally follow a series of steps that include:\n\nExamples of Strategic Management\n\nConsider a large company that wants to achieve more ambitious online sales rates. To meet this goal, the company will develop a strategy, communicate the plan, apply it across various units and departments, integrate it with employee goals, and execute it accordingly. If an effective strategy is created, it will help the company achieve its targets through a single, coordinated process.\n\nSuppose a for-profit technical college wishes to increase new student enrollment and enrolled student graduation rates over the next three years. The purpose is to make the college known as the best buy for a student's money and increase revenue. The school may evaluate its financials to create high-tech classrooms and hire the most qualified instructors. The college may also devote resources to marketing and recruitment.\n\nWhy Is Strategic Management Important?\n\nStrategic management allows a company to analyze areas for operational improvement. It may follow an analytical process—identifying specific threats and specific opportunities—unique to the company. A company may choose general strategic management guidelines that apply to any company.\n\nWhat Are the Key Elements of Strategic Management?\n\nStrategic management is not a one-size-fits-all strategy. However, there are key elements that are found to be critical. These include goal setting, industry and organizational analyses, strategy formation, strategy implementation; and the measurement, monitoring, and controlling of strategies.\n\nWhat Internal Changes May Be Implemented in Strategic Management?\n\nSome action steps that companies may take to execute their strategic management plans include realigning financial and personnel resources or changing the methods to create, sell, and deploy products and services.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nStrategic management is the assembling and management of resources to achieve a company's goals and objectives. Companies create and adapt a strategic management process that works best for the firm. Strategic management does not end with implementation but is commonly reevaluated well into the organization's future.\n\nHarvard University. \"Strategic Leadership.\"\n\nStrategic Planet. \"The Strategic Management Process.\"\n\nHarvard University. \"A Manager's Guide to Successful Strategy Implementation.\"\n\nRelated Articles\n\n",

P4 is short for \"predictive, preventive, personalized and participatory\".\n\nWhile the tailoring of treatment to patients dates back at least to the time of Hippocrates, the usage of the term has risen in recent years thanks to the development of new diagnostic and informatics approaches that provide an understanding of the molecular basis of disease, particularly genomics. This provides a clear biomarker on which to stratify related patients.[1][2][3]\n\nAmong the 14 Grand Challenges for Engineering, an initiative sponsored by National Academy of Engineering (NAE), personalized medicine has been identified as a key and prospective approach to \"achieve optimal individual health decisions\", therefore overcoming the challenge to \"engineer better medicines\".[4][5]\n\nDevelopment of concept\n\nIn personalised medicine, diagnostic testing is often employed for selecting appropriate and optimal therapies based on the patient's genetics or their other molecular or cellular characteristics.[citation needed] The use of genetic information has played a major role in certain aspects of personalized medicine (e.g. pharmacogenomics), and the term was first coined in the context of genetics, though it has since broadened to encompass all sorts of personalization measures,[6] including the use of proteomics,[7] imaging analysis, nanoparticle-based theranostics,[8] among others.\n\nDifference between precision medicine and personalized medicine\n\nPrecision medicine is a medical model that proposes the customization of healthcare, with medical decisions, treatments, practices, or products being tailored to a subgroup of patients, instead of a one‐drug‐fits‐all model.[9][10] In precision medicine, diagnostic testing is often employed for selecting appropriate and optimal therapies based on the context of a patient's genetic content or other molecular or cellular analysis.[11] Tools employed in precision medicine can include molecular diagnostics, imaging, and analytics.[10][12]\n\nPrecision medicine and personalized medicine (also individualized medicine) are analogous, applying a person's genetic profile to guide clinical decisions about the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of a disease.[13] Personalized medicine is established on discoveries from the Human Genome Project.[13]\n\nIn explaining the distinction from the similar term of personalized medicine, the United States President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology writes:[14]\n\nPrecision medicine refers to the tailoring of medical treatment to the individual characteristics of each patient. It does not literally mean the creation of drugs or medical devices that are unique to a patient, but rather the ability to classify individuals into subpopulations that differ in their susceptibility to a particular disease, in the biology or prognosis of those diseases they may develop, or in their response to a specific treatment. Preventive or therapeutic interventions can then be concentrated on those who will benefit, sparing expense and side effects for those who will not.[14]\n\nThe use of the term \"precision medicine\" can extend beyond treatment selection to also cover creating unique medical products for particular individuals—for example, \"...patient-specific tissue or organs to tailor treatments for different people.\"[15] Hence, the term in practice has so much overlap with \"personalized medicine\" that they are often used interchangeably, even though the latter is sometimes misinterpreted as involving a unique treatment for each individual.[16]\n\nBackground\n\nBasics\n\nEvery person has a unique variation of the human genome.[17] Although most of the variation between individuals has no effect on health, an individual's health stems from genetic variation with behaviors and influences from the environment.[18][11]\n\nModern advances in personalized medicine rely on technology that confirms a patient's fundamental biology, DNA, RNA, or protein, which ultimately leads to confirming disease. For example, personalised techniques such as genome sequencing can reveal mutations in DNA that influence diseases ranging from cystic fibrosis to cancer. Another method, called RNA-seq, can show which RNA molecules are involved with specific diseases. Unlike DNA, levels of RNA can change in response to the environment. Therefore, sequencing RNA can provide a broader understanding of a person's state of health. Recent studies have linked genetic differences between individuals to RNA expression,[19] translation,[20] and protein levels.[21]\n\nThe concepts of personalised medicine can be applied to new and transformative approaches to health care. Personalised health care is based on the dynamics of systems biology and uses predictive tools to evaluate health risks and to design personalised health plans to help patients mitigate risks, prevent disease and to treat it with precision when it occurs. The concepts of personalised health care are receiving increasing acceptance with the Veterans Administration committing to personalised, proactive patient driven care for all veterans.[22] In some instances personalised health care can be tailored to the markup of the disease causing agent instead of the patient's genetic markup; examples are drug resistant bacteria or viruses.[23]\n\nPrecision medicine often involves the application of panomic analysis and systems biology to analyze the cause of an individual patient's disease at the molecular level and then to utilize targeted treatments (possibly in combination) to address that individual patient's disease process. The patient's response is then tracked as closely as possible, often using surrogate measures such as tumor load (versus true outcomes, such as five-year survival rate), and the treatment finely adapted to the patient's response.[24][25] The branch of precision medicine that addresses cancer is referred to as \"precision oncology\".[26][27] The field of precision medicine that is related to psychiatric disorders and mental health is called \"precision psychiatry.\"[28][29]\n\nInter-personal difference of molecular pathology is diverse, so as inter-personal difference in the exposome, which influence disease processes through the interactome within the tissue microenvironment, differentially from person to person. As the theoretical basis of precision medicine, the \"unique disease principle\"[30] emerged to embrace the ubiquitous phenomenon of heterogeneity of disease etiology and pathogenesis. The unique disease principle was first described in neoplastic diseases as the unique tumor principle.[31] As the exposome is a common concept of epidemiology, precision medicine is intertwined with molecular pathological epidemiology, which is capable of identifying potential biomarkers for precision medicine.",

Unlike modern medicine, which employs the scientific method to test plausible therapies by way of responsible and ethical clinical trials, producing repeatable evidence of either effect or of no effect, alternative therapies reside outside of mainstream medicine[n 1][n 2] and do not originate from using the scientific method, but instead rely on testimonials, anecdotes, religion, tradition, superstition, belief in supernatural \"energies\", pseudoscience, errors in reasoning, propaganda, fraud, or other unscientific sources. Frequently used terms for relevant practices are New Age medicine, pseudo-medicine, unorthodox medicine, holistic medicine, fringe medicine, and unconventional medicine, with little distinction from quackery.\n\nSome alternative practices are based on theories that contradict the established science of how the human body works; others appeal to the supernatural or superstitious to explain their effect or lack thereof. In others, the practice has plausibility but lacks a positive risk–benefit outcome probability. Research into alternative therapies often fails to follow proper research protocols (such as placebo-controlled trials, blind experiments and calculation of prior probability), providing invalid results. History has shown that if a method is proven to work, it eventually ceases to be alternative and becomes mainstream medicine.\n\nMuch of the perceived effect of an alternative practice arises from a belief that it will be effective, the placebo effect, or from the treated condition resolving on its own (the natural course of disease). This is further exacerbated by the tendency to turn to alternative therapies upon the failure of medicine, at which point the condition will be at its worst and most likely to spontaneously improve. In the absence of this bias, especially for diseases that are not expected to get better by themselves such as cancer or HIV infection, multiple studies have shown significantly worse outcomes if patients turn to alternative therapies. While this may be because these patients avoid effective treatment, some alternative therapies are actively harmful (e.g. cyanide poisoning from amygdalin, or the intentional ingestion of hydrogen peroxide) or actively interfere with effective treatments.\n\nThe alternative medicine sector is a highly profitable industry with a strong lobby,[1] and faces far less regulation over the use and marketing of unproven treatments. Complementary medicine (CM), complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), integrated medicine or integrative medicine (IM), and holistic medicine attempt to combine alternative practices with those of mainstream medicine. Traditional medicine practices become \"alternative\" when used outside their original settings and without proper scientific explanation and evidence. Alternative methods are often marketed as more \"natural\" or \"holistic\" than methods offered by medical science, that is sometimes derogatorily called \"Big Pharma\" by supporters of alternative medicine. Billions of dollars have been spent studying alternative medicine, with few or no positive results and many methods thoroughly disproven.\n\nDefinitions and terminology\n\nThe terms alternative medicine, complementary medicine, integrative medicine, holistic medicine, natural medicine, unorthodox medicine, fringe medicine, unconventional medicine, and new age medicine are used interchangeably as having the same meaning and are almost synonymous in most contexts.[3][4][5][6] Terminology has shifted over time, reflecting the preferred branding of practitioners.[7] For example, the United States National Institutes of Health department studying alternative medicine, currently named the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), was established as the Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM) and was renamed the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) before obtaining its current name. Therapies are often framed as \"natural\" or \"holistic\", implicitly and intentionally suggesting that conventional medicine is \"artificial\" and \"narrow in scope\".[1][8]\n\nThe meaning of the term \"alternative\" in the expression \"alternative medicine\", is not that it is an effective alternative to medical science (though some alternative medicine promoters may use the loose terminology to give the appearance of effectiveness).[9][10] Loose terminology may also be used to suggest meaning that a dichotomy exists when it does not (e.g.",

      "raw_content": "Contents\n\nMedicine in the medieval Islamic world\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the history of medicine, \"Islamic medicine\", also known as \"Arabian medicine\" is the science of medicine developed in the Middle East, and usually written in Arabic, the lingua franca of Islamic civilization.[1][2]\n\nIslamic medicine adopted, systematized and developed the medical knowledge of classical antiquity, including the major traditions of Hippocrates, Galen and Dioscorides.[3] During the post-classical era, Middle Eastern medicine was the most advanced in the world, integrating concepts of Modern Greek, Roman, Mesopotamian and Persian medicine as well as the ancient Indian tradition of Ayurveda, while making numerous advances and innovations. Islamic medicine, along with knowledge of classical medicine, was later adopted in the medieval medicine of Western Europe, after European physicians became familiar with Islamic medical authors during the Renaissance of the 12th century.[4]\n\nMedieval Islamic physicians largely retained their authority until the rise of medicine as a part of the natural sciences, beginning with the Age of Enlightenment, nearly six hundred years after their textbooks were opened by many people. Aspects of their writings remain of interest to physicians even today.[5][page needed]\n\nOverview\n\nMedicine was a central part of medieval Islamic culture. This period was called the Golden Age of Islam and lasted from the eighth century to the fourteenth century.[6] The economic and social standing of the patient determined to a large extent the type of care sought and the expectations of the patients varied along with the approaches of the practitioners.[7]\n\nResponding to circumstances of time and place/location, Islamic physicians and scholars created an extensive and complex medical literature exploring, analyzing, and synthesizing the theory and practice of medicine[citation needed] Islamic medicine was initially built on tradition, chiefly the theoretical and practical knowledge developed in Arabia in the time of Muhammad, ancient Hellenistic medicine such as Unani, ancient Indian medicine such as Ayurveda, and the ancient Iranian Medicine of the Academy of Gundishapur. The works of ancient Greek and Roman physicians Hippocrates,[8] Galen and Dioscorides also had a lasting impact on Middle Eastern medicine.[9] Intellectual thirst, open-mindness, and vigor were at an all-time high in this era. During the Golden Age of Islam, classical learning was sought out, systematised and improved upon by scientists and scholars with such diligence that Arab science became the most advanced of its day.[6] Ophthalmology has been described as the most successful branch of medicine researched at the time, with the works of Ibn al-Haytham retaining an authority in the field until early modern times.[10]\n\nOverall, Islamic Medicine is a combination of medicines from Greece, Persia, Syria, India, and Byzantine. The literary and scientific lingua franca was adapted, changed and most important “islamicized”.The effect of it was not only spread in Islamic lands, but was also spread in Europe, Asia, China, and the Far East.[11]\n\nHistory, origins and sources\n\nṬibb an-Nabawī – Prophetic Medicine\n\nThe adoption by the newly forming Islamic society of the medical knowledge of the surrounding, or newly conquered, \"heathen\" civilizations had to be justified as being in accordance with the beliefs of Islam. Early on, the study and practice of medicine was understood as an act of piety, founded on the principles of īmān (faith) and tawakkul (trust).[2][12]\n\nThe Prophet not only instructed sick people to take medicine, but he himself invited expert physicians for this purpose.\n\nMuhammad's opinions on health issues and habits in regard to the leading of a healthy life were collected early on and edited as a separate corpus of writings under the title Ṭibb an-Nabī (\"The Medicine of the Prophet\"). In the 14th century, Ibn Khaldun, in his work Muqaddimah provides a brief overview over what he called \"the art and craft of medicine\", separating the science of medicine from religion:[13]\n\nYou'll have to know that the origin of all maladies goes back to nutrition, as the Prophet – God bless him! – says with regard to the entire medical tradition, as commonly known by all physicians, even if this is contested by the religious scholars. These are his words: \"The stomach is the House of Illness, and abstinence is the most important medicine. The cause of every illness is poor digestion.\"\n\nIbn Khaldun says that there was a medicine which was practiced at that time, though it is not connected to the religion. This type of medicine which was taken from Bedouins was not rely on science.[11]\n\nThe Sahih al-Bukhari, a collection of prophetic traditions, or hadith by Muhammad al-Bukhari refers to a collection of Muhammad's opinions on medicine, by his younger contemporary Anas bin-Malik. Anas writes about two physicians who had treated him by cauterization and mentions that the prophet wanted to avoid this treatment and had asked for alternative treatments. Later on, there are reports of the caliph ʿUthmān ibn ʿAffān fixing his teeth with a wire made of gold. He also mentions that the habit of cleaning one's teeth with a small wooden toothpick dates back to pre-Islamic times.[14]\n\nThe \"Prophetic medicine\" was rarely mentioned by the classical authors of Islamic medicine, but lived on in the materia medica for some centuries. In his Kitāb aṣ-Ṣaydalah (Book of Remedies) from the 10./11. century, Al-Biruni refers to collected poems and other works dealing with, and commenting on, the materia medica of the old Arabs.[14]\n\nThe most famous physician was Al-Ḥariṯ ben-Kalada aṯ-Ṯaqafī, who lived at the same time as the prophet. He is supposed to have been in touch with the Academy of Gondishapur, perhaps he was even trained there. He reportedly had a conversation once with Khosrow I Anushirvan about medical topics.[15]\n\nPhysicians during the early years of Islam\n\nMost likely, the Arabian physicians became familiar with the Graeco-Roman and late Hellenistic medicine through direct contact with physicians who were practicing in the newly conquered regions rather than by reading the original or translated works. The translation of the capital of the emerging Islamic world to Damascus may have facilitated this contact, as Syrian medicine was part of that ancient tradition. The names of two Christian physicians are known: Ibn Aṯāl worked at the court of Muawiyah I, the founder of the Umayyad dynasty. The caliph abused his knowledge in order to get rid of some of his enemies by way of poisoning. Likewise, Abu l-Ḥakam, who was responsible for the preparation of drugs, was employed by Muawiah. His son, grandson, and great-grandson were also serving the Umayyad and Abbasid caliphate.[14]\n\nThese sources testify to the fact that the physicians of the emerging Islamic society were familiar with the classical medical traditions already at the times of the Umayyads. The medical knowledge likely arrived from Alexandria, and was probably transferred by Syrian scholars, or translators, finding its way into the Islamic world.[14]\n\nMedicine during the Islamic Period\n\nThe Islamic medical tradition arose during the medieval period (c. 650–1500) and had a major impact on humans along with setting the foundation for future medicine including the current modern Western medicine.[16] This tradition had a lasting impact in that it contributed to the European medicine along with continuing to influence medical practices today.[16]\n\n7th–9th century: The adoption of earlier traditions\n\nVery few sources provide information about how the expanding Islamic society received any medical knowledge. A physician called Abdalmalik ben Abgar al-Kinānī from Kufa in Iraq is supposed to have worked at the medical school of Alexandria before he joined ʿUmar ibn ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz's court. ʿUmar transferred the medical school from Alexandria to Antioch.",

      "raw_content": "medicine\n\nOur editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article.\n\nmedicine,  the practice concerned with the maintenance of health and the prevention, alleviation, or cure of disease.\n\nThe World Health Organization at its 1978 international conference held in the Soviet Union produced the Alma-Ata Health Declaration, which was designed to serve governments as a basis for planning health care that would reach people at all levels of society. The declaration reaffirmed that\n\nhealth, which is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, is a fundamental human right and that the attainment of the highest possible level of health is a most important world-wide social goal whose realization requires the action of many other social and economic sectors in addition to the health sector.\n\nIn its widest form, the practice of medicine—that is to say, the promotion and care of health—is concerned with this ideal.\n\nOrganization of health services\n\nIt is generally the goal of most countries to have their health services organized in such a way to ensure that individuals, families, and communities obtain the maximum benefit from current knowledge and technology available for the promotion, maintenance, and restoration of health. In order to play their part in this process, governments and other agencies are faced with numerous tasks, including the following: (1) They must obtain as much information as is possible on the size, extent, and urgency of their needs; without accurate information, planning can be misdirected. (2) These needs must then be revised against the resources likely to be available in terms of money, manpower, and materials; developing countries may well require external aid to supplement their own resources. (3) Based on their assessments, countries then need to determine realistic objectives and draw up plans. (4) Finally, a process of evaluation needs to be built into the program; the lack of reliable information and accurate assessment can lead to confusion, waste, and inefficiency.\n\nHealth services of any nature reflect a number of interrelated characteristics, among which the most obvious, but not necessarily the most important from a national point of view, is the curative function; that is to say, caring for those already ill. Others include special services that deal with particular groups (such as children or pregnant women) and with specific needs such as nutrition or immunization; preventive services, the protection of the health both of individuals and of communities; health education; and, as mentioned above, the collection and analysis of information.\n\nLevels of health care\n\nIn the curative domain there are various forms of medical practice. They may be thought of generally as forming a pyramidal structure, with three tiers representing increasing degrees of specialization and technical sophistication but catering to diminishing numbers of patients as they are filtered out of the system at a lower level. Only those patients who require special attention either for diagnosis or treatment should reach the second (advisory) or third (specialized treatment) tiers where the cost per item of service becomes increasingly higher. The first level represents primary health care, or first contact care, at which patients have their initial contact with the health-care system.\n\nPrimary health care is an integral part of a country’s health maintenance system, of which it forms the largest and most important part. As described in the declaration of Alma-Ata, primary health care should be “based on practical, scientifically sound and socially acceptable methods and technology made universally accessible to individuals and families in the community through their full participation and at a cost that the community and country can afford to maintain at every stage of their development.” Primary health care in the developed countries is usually the province of a medically qualified physician; in the developing countries first contact care is often provided by nonmedically qualified personnel.\n\nThe vast majority of patients can be fully dealt with at the primary level. Those who cannot are referred to the second tier (secondary health care, or the referral services) for the opinion of a consultant with specialized knowledge or for X-ray examinations and special tests. Secondary health care often requires the technology offered by a local or regional hospital. Increasingly, however, the radiological and laboratory services provided by hospitals are available directly to the family doctor, thus improving his service to patients and increasing its range. The third tier of health care, employing specialist services, is offered by institutions such as teaching hospitals and units devoted to the care of particular groups—women, children, patients with mental disorders, and so on. The dramatic differences in the cost of treatment at the various levels is a matter of particular importance in developing countries, where the cost of treatment for patients at the primary health-care level is usually only a small fraction of that at the third level; medical costs at any level in such countries, however, are usually borne by the government.\n\nIdeally, provision of health care at all levels will be available to all patients; such health care may be said to be universal. The well-off, both in relatively wealthy industrialized countries and in the poorer developing world, may be able to get medical attention from sources they prefer and can pay for in the private sector. The vast majority of people in most countries, however, are dependent in various ways upon health services provided by the state, to which they may contribute comparatively little or, in the case of poor countries, nothing at all.\n\n",

      "raw_content": "List of medical roots, suffixes and prefixes\n\nThis is a list of roots, suffixes, and prefixes used in medical terminology, their meanings, and their etymologies. Most of them are combining forms in Neo-Latin and hence international scientific vocabulary. There are a few general rules about how they combine. First, prefixes and suffixes, most of which are derived from ancient Greek or classical Latin, have a droppable vowel, usually -o-. As a general rule, this vowel almost always acts as a joint-stem to connect two consonantal roots (e.g. arthr- + -o- + -logy = arthrology), but generally, the -o- is dropped when connecting to a vowel-stem (e.g. arthr- + -itis = arthritis, instead of arthr-o-itis). Second, medical roots generally go together according to language, i.e., Greek prefixes occur with Greek suffixes and Latin prefixes with Latin suffixes. Although international scientific vocabulary is not stringent about segregating combining forms of different languages, it is advisable when coining new words not to mix different lingual roots.\n\n\n\nPrefixes and suffixes\n\nThe following is an alphabetical list of medical prefixes and suffixes, along with their meanings, origins, and English examples.\n\nA\n\nAffix | Meaning | Origin language and etymology | Example(s)\na-,an- | not, without (alpha privative) | Greekἀ-/ἀν-(a-/an-), not, without | analgesic,apathy,anencephaly\nab- | from;

      "raw_content": "history of medicine\n\nOur editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article.\n\nhistory of medicine,  the development of the prevention and treatment of disease from prehistoric and ancient times to the 21st century.\n\nMedicine and surgery before 1800\n\nEarly medicine and folklore\n\nUnwritten history is not easy to interpret, and, although much may be learned from a study of the drawings, bony remains, and surgical tools of early humans, it is difficult to reconstruct their mental attitude toward the problems of disease and death. It seems probable that, as soon as they reached the stage of reasoning, they discovered by the process of trial and error which plants might be used as foods, which of them were poisonous, and which of them had some medicinal value. Folk medicine or domestic medicine, consisting largely in the use of vegetable products, or herbs, originated in this fashion and still persists.\n\nBut that is not the whole story. Humans did not at first regard death and disease as natural phenomena. Common maladies, such as colds or constipation, were accepted as part of existence and dealt with by means of such herbal remedies as were available. Serious and disabling diseases, however, were placed in a very different category. These were of supernatural origin. They might be the result of a spell cast upon the victim by some enemy, visitation by a malevolent demon, or the work of an offended god who had either projected some object—a dart, a stone, a worm—into the body of the victim or had abstracted something, usually the soul of the patient. The treatment then applied was to lure the errant soul back to its proper habitat within the body or to extract the evil intruder, be it dart or demon, by counterspells, incantations, potions, suction, or other means.\n\nOne curious method of providing the disease with means of escape from the body was by making a hole, 2.5 to 5 cm across, in the skull of the victim—the practice of trepanning, or trephining. Trepanned skulls of prehistoric date have been found in Britain, France, and other parts of Europe and in Peru. Many of them show evidence of healing and, presumably, of the patient’s survival. The practice still exists among some tribal people in parts of Algeria, in Melanesia, and perhaps elsewhere, though it is fast becoming extinct.\n\nMagic and religion played a large part in the medicine of prehistoric or early human society. Administration of a vegetable drug or remedy by mouth was accompanied by incantations, dancing, grimaces, and all the tricks of the magician. Therefore, the first doctors, or “medicine men,” were witch doctors or sorcerers. The use of charms and talismans, still prevalent in modern times, is of ancient origin.\n\nApart from the treatment of wounds and broken bones, the folklore of medicine is probably the most ancient aspect of the art of healing, for primitive physicians showed their wisdom by treating the whole person, soul as well as body. Treatments and medicines that produced no physical effects on the body could nevertheless make a patient feel better when both healer and patient believed in their efficacy. This so-called placebo effect is applicable even in modern clinical medicine.\n\nThe ancient Middle East and Egypt\n\nThe establishment of the calendar and the invention of writing marked the dawn of recorded history. The clues to early knowledge are few, consisting only of clay tablets bearing cuneiform signs and seals that were used by physicians of ancient Mesopotamia. In the Louvre Museum in France, a stone pillar is preserved on which is inscribed the Code of Hammurabi, who was a Babylonian king of the 18th century bce. This code includes laws relating to the practice of medicine, and the penalties for failure were severe. For example, “If the doctor, in opening an abscess, shall kill the patient, his hands shall be cut off”; if, however, the patient was a slave, the doctor was simply obliged to supply another slave.\n\nGreek historian Herodotus stated that every Babylonian was an amateur physician, since it was the custom to lay the sick in the street so that anyone passing by might offer advice. Divination, from the inspection of the liver of a sacrificed animal, was widely practiced to foretell the course of a disease. Little else is known regarding Babylonian medicine, and the name of not a single physician has survived.\n\nWhen the medicine of ancient Egypt is examined, the picture becomes clearer. The first physician to emerge is Imhotep, chief minister to King Djoser in the 3rd millennium bce, who designed one of the earliest pyramids, the Step Pyramid at Ṣaqqārah, and who was later regarded as the Egyptian god of medicine and identified with the Greek god Asclepius. Surer knowledge comes from the study of Egyptian papyri, especially the Ebers papyrus and Edwin Smith papyrus discovered in the 19th century. The former is a list of remedies, with appropriate spells or incantations, while the latter is a surgical treatise on the treatment of wounds and other injuries.\n\nContrary to what might be expected, the widespread practice of embalming the dead body did not stimulate study of human anatomy. The preservation of mummies has, however, revealed some of the diseases suffered at that time, including arthritis, tuberculosis of the bone, gout, tooth decay, bladder stones, and gallstones; there is evidence too of the parasitic disease schistosomiasis, which remains a scourge still. There seems to have been no syphilis or rickets.\n\nThe search for information on ancient medicine leads naturally from the papyri of Egypt to Hebrew literature. Though the Bible contains little on the medical practices of ancient Israel, it is a mine of information on social and personal hygiene. The Jews were indeed pioneers in matters of public health.\n\n",

Their contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine entered and shaped the Greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity, whereby formal attempts were made to provide explanations of events in the physical world based on natural causes, while further advancements, including the introduction of the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, were made during the Golden Age of India.[15]: 12 [16][17][18] Scientific research deteriorated in these regions after the fall of the Western Roman Empire during the Early Middle Ages (400–1000 CE), but in the Medieval renaissances (Carolingian Renaissance, Ottonian Renaissance and the Renaissance of the 12th century) scholarship flourished again. Some Greek manuscripts lost in Western Europe were preserved and expanded upon in the Middle East during the Islamic Golden Age,[19] Later, Byzantine Greek scholars contributed to their transmission by bringing Greek manuscripts from the declining Byzantine Empire to Western Europe at the beginning of the Renaissance.\n\nThe recovery and assimilation of Greek works and Islamic inquiries into Western Europe from the 10th to 13th centuries revived natural philosophy,[20][21][22] which was later transformed by the Scientific Revolution that began in the 16th century[23] as new ideas and discoveries departed from previous Greek conceptions and traditions.[24][25] The scientific method soon played a greater role in knowledge creation and in the 19th century many of the institutional and professional features of science began to take shape,[26][27] along with the changing of \"natural philosophy\" to \"natural science\".[28]\n\nNew knowledge in science is advanced by research from scientists who are motivated by curiosity about the world and a desire to solve problems.[29][30] Contemporary scientific research is highly collaborative and is usually done by teams in academic and research institutions,[31] government agencies,[32] and companies.[33] The practical impact of their work has led to the emergence of science policies that seek to influence the scientific enterprise by prioritising the ethical and moral development of commercial products, armaments, health care, public infrastructure, and environmental protection.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe word science has been used in Middle English since the 14th century in the sense of \"the state of knowing\". The word was borrowed from the Anglo-Norman language as the suffix -cience, which was borrowed from the Latin word scientia, meaning \"knowledge, awareness, understanding\", a noun derivative of sciens meaning \"knowing\", itself the present active participle of sciō, \"to know\".[34]\n\nThere are many hypotheses for science's ultimate word origin. According to Michiel de Vaan, Dutch linguist and Indo-Europeanist, sciō may have its origin in the Proto-Italic language as *skije- or *skijo- meaning \"to know\", which may originate from Proto-Indo-European language as *skh1-ie, *skh1-io, meaning \"to incise\". The Lexikon der indogermanischen Verben proposed sciō is a back-formation of nescīre, meaning \"to not know, be unfamiliar with\", which may derive from Proto-Indo-European *sekH- in Latin secāre, or *skh2-, from *sḱʰeh2(i)- meaning \"to cut\".[35]\n\nIn the past, science was a synonym for \"knowledge\" or \"study\", in keeping with its Latin origin. A person who conducted scientific research was called a \"natural philosopher\" or \"man of science\".[36] In 1834, William Whewell introduced the term scientist in a review of Mary Somerville's book On the Connexion of the Physical Sciences,[37] crediting it to \"some ingenious gentleman\" (possibly himself).[38]\n\nHistory\n\nEarly history\n\nScience has no single origin. Rather, scientific thinking emerged gradually over the course of tens of thousands of years,[39][40] taking different forms around the world, and few details are known about the very earliest developments. Women likely played a central role in prehistoric science,[41] as did religious rituals.[42] Some scholars use the term \"protoscience\" to label activities in the past that resemble modern science in some but not all features;[43][44][45] however, this label has also been criticised as denigrating,[46] or too suggestive of presentism, thinking about those activities only in relation to modern categories.[47]\n\nDirect evidence for scientific processes becomes clearer with the advent of writing systems in the Bronze Age civilisations of Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia (c. 3000–1200 BCE), creating the earliest written records in the history of science.[15]: 12–15 [16] Although the words and concepts of \"science\" and \"nature\" were not part of the conceptual landscape at the time, the ancient Egyptians and Mesopotamians made contributions that would later find a place in Greek and medieval science: mathematics, astronomy, and medicine.[48][15]: 12  From the 3rd millennium BCE, the ancient Egyptians developed a non-positional decimal numbering system,[49] solved practical problems using geometry,[50] and developed a calendar.[51] Their healing therapies involved drug treatments and the supernatural, such as prayers, incantations, and rituals.[15]: 9\n\nThe ancient Mesopotamians used knowledge about the properties of various natural chemicals for manufacturing pottery, faience, glass, soap, metals, lime plaster, and waterproofing.[52] They studied animal physiology, anatomy, behaviour, and astrology for divinatory purposes.[53] The Mesopotamians had an intense interest in medicine and the earliest medical prescriptions appeared in Sumerian during the Third Dynasty of Ur.[52][54] They seem to have studied scientific subjects which had practical or religious applications and had little interest in satisfying curiosity.[52]\n\nClassical antiquity\n\nIn classical antiquity, there is no real ancient analogue of a modern scientist. Instead, well-educated, usually upper-class, and almost universally male individuals performed various investigations into nature whenever they could afford the time.[55] Before the invention or discovery of the concept of phusis or nature by the pre-Socratic philosophers, the same words tend to be used to describe the natural \"way\" in which a plant grows,[56] and the \"way\" in which, for example, one tribe worships a particular god. For this reason, it is claimed that these men were the first philosophers in the strict sense and the first to clearly distinguish \"nature\" and \"convention\".",

      "raw_content": "What is Natural Sciences?\n\nLast updated: Nov 27, 2024\n\nIf you've ever asked yourself how animals survive in the wild, what fuels a rocket launch, or why some chemicals react explosively while others donât, youâre already on the path of a natural scientist.\n\nNatural sciences focus on applying scientific methods through hands-on experiments, observations, and data analysis. They focus on discovering the laws and patterns that explain how the universe and everything within it functions, from the smallest particles to the largest ecosystems.\n\nBy studying areas like ecosystems in biology, chemical reactions in chemistry, and the law of physics, students gain a clear and practical understanding of how the natural world operates. This approach encourages curiosity, and critical thinking, and prepares them to tackle some of the worldâs most pressing issues, from climate change to medical breakthroughs.\n\nIn this blog, weâll explore what makes natural sciences courses and science summer school programmes from Oxford Summer courses so exciting, dive into their different branches, and highlight the skills youâll develop that are essential for any budding scientist.\n\nPlus, weâll look at the career paths when you study these subjects. If you're a student eager to make sense of the world or a parent looking for inspiring science programmes, this guide will show you why you should consider natural sciences.\n\nLetâs get started!\n\nWhat is Natural Sciences?\n\nNatural sciences courses give you the chance to dive deeper into how the world works and explore the fascinating connections between living things, ecosystems, matter, and energy. Itâs all about understanding the big picture and the smaller details that make our universe so incredible.\n\nWith natural sciences, you can focus on the topics that interest you most. Here are a few exciting fields you can explore:\n\nStudying natural sciences doesnât just answer questions about natureâit helps explain everyday things like why animals behave the way they do, how technology works, and the impact of the environment around us. Itâs about tackling big questions, solving real-world problems, and uncovering how everything is connected. Natural sciences let you see the world with fresh eyes, helping you understand the amazing way it all fits together!\n\nWhy study Natural Sciences?\n\nHereâs a quick snapshot of why you should consider studying natural sciences at university:\n\n1. Freedom of Choice\n\nAs you build a solid foundation in all the scientific disciplines, you'll have the chance to explore various fields and discover what type of scientist you truly want to become. You might even find yourself drawn to subjects you hadn't previously considered as you experiment with new areas of study.\n\nDonât worry about balancing your interests â by the end of your third year, youâll have the opportunity to choose three subjects from a wide selection of 18, allowing plenty of room for creativity. You may decide to do physics, chemistry, or pharmacology and psychology, or any number of other exciting combinations. While itâs always a challenge to juggle so many disparate courses it is good to know that the final choice is ultimately up to you.\n\n2. Passion for Science\n\nWhen applying to study natural sciences, the key thing admissions tutors want to see is your passion for science.\n\nAt GCSE and A-Level, you've likely studied general \"Science,\" but since this isn't a university degree option, it can be tricky to know what to apply for when the time comes.\n\nIn your first year of natural science courses, youâll experience a broad range of subjects, with opportunities to specialise in your second year and focus entirely on one area by the third year. The subjects are generally divided into biological and physical sciences, but you can also opt for a broader study path if you prefer.\n\nThe best part? You donât have to decide right away. If you choose to go to a science summer school like Oxford Summer Courses, you can explore multiple scientific fields without committing to your preference right away. This flexibility is particularly useful if you're passionate about several areas of science, making it easier than applying for different subjects at different universities with just one personal statement.\n\n3. Cultivates a Passion for Learning\n\nThe thrill of discovering more of the world around us - whether thatâs understanding how fish breathe underwater or why the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, sparks curiosity in students and inspires them to explore the wonders of the natural world.\n\n4. Heart of technology\n\nBy understanding how the natural world works, scientists can create new technologies, materials, medicines, and solutions that improve our lives.\n\nFor example:\n\nKey Skills Youâll Learn in Natural Sciences\n\nOne of the most valuable skills youâll develop if you study natural sciences is scientific thinking. This means learning how to approach questions step by step, using observation, experimentation, and analysis. You'll figure out how to break down complicated problems, test ideas (hypotheses), and interpret the results you get.\n\nYou'll also strengthen your critical thinking. This involves paying close attention to details, recognising patterns, and analysing data to make sense of what you observe. For example, youâll learn how to collect and organise information, then use it to draw meaningful conclusions.\n\nAs you go deeper into your studies, problem-solving becomes second nature. Whether you're tackling real-world issues or scientific questions, youâll learn how to identify problems, come up with creative solutions, and test them through experimentation. You'll also hone your logical reasoning skills, applying deductive and inductive reasoning to draw valid conclusions based on evidence.\n\nThese skills - critical thinking, problem-solving, and analysis -are not just for science; they can be applied to many areas of life. They help you approach challenges with a clear, logical mindset and make smart decisions based on facts, not assumptions.\n\nStudying natural sciences also gives you a flexible mindset, helping you see how different fields of science connect. Along the way, youâll develop strong communication and organisation skills - important for explaining complex ideas and managing projects.\n\nUltimately, the skills you gain from natural sciences will prepare you not only for a career in science but also for handling challenges in any field. You'll leave the course with the tools to think critically, solve problems creatively, and apply what youâve learned to all kinds of situations.\n\nFamous Scientists and Their Work\n\nSome of the most groundbreaking ideas in science come from influential scientists whose discoveries changed how we understand the world.\n\nTake Isaac Newton, for example. He formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation, explaining how everything from falling apples to the movements of planets could be described by the same principles.\n\nHis work laid the foundation for classical mechanics and shaped the way we view forces and movement. Today, Newtonâs laws remain fundamental to physics, influencing everything from space travel to how we build structures on Earth.\n\nCharles Darwin is another figure whose work dramatically changed our perspective. His theory of evolution by natural selection explained how species adapt and change over generations.\n\nBefore Darwin, there was little understanding of how life evolved. His ideas not only transformed biology but also challenged the way we think about lifeâs diversity on Earth. Evolutionary theory now forms the backbone of modern biological sciences, influencing fields like genetics, ecology, and medicine.\n\nIn chemistry, Marie Curie broke new ground with her discovery of radioactivity. She identified two elements, polonium, and radium, and her research advanced our understanding of atomic science.",

In elementary school, you might learn basics about the Earth, in high school you’ll begin to explore biology, and then at the university level, the sky’s the limit.\n\nBut did you know that there are five major types of natural sciences? Each one looks at different aspects of our world (and some beyond) with the purpose of researching and making sense of it all. Let’s take a closer look at what natural science is, including its meaning, the different branches, and natural science courses you can take.\n\n\n\nSource: Unsplash Alt text: view of a satellite and earth from space in the study of space science\n\nNatural Science: Definition\n\nThere’s no one answer to the question “What is natural science?” Natural science is made up of different branches, like physics, chemistry, or biology. However, the one thing they mostly all have in common is that, in general, natural science deals with matter in the same way.\n\nAccording to Merriam Webster’s definition of natural science, it’s any science that deals with “matter, energy, and their interrelations and transformations or with objectively measurable phenomena.”\n\nThe Meaning of Natural Science\n\nNow that we’ve defined natural science, you probably want a deeper understanding of what it really means, at its core.\n\nNatural science is based completely around events and phenomena that occur naturally.\n\nHumans have a curiosity as to why certain things occur in nature, and this is where natural science comes in. Researchers and scientists explore these natural events to better understand them and why they took place.\n\nThis research can then be used to predict future events or explain why and how things happen in nature so that we can protect or even mimic these processes.\n\nNatural science should not be confused with social science, which seeks to understand humans, not nature. Natural science helps humans understand the world around them and to seek explanations for the seemingly unexplainable, whether that’s weather patterns or how stars and galaxies are formed.\n\nHowever, one similarity between social science and natural science is their ultimate goal: to learn. As humans, we want to understand and learn more about the world around us and the people in them, and this concept is shared between many types of sciences.\n\nThe Two Main Subjects in Natural Sciences\n\nNatural science can be further broken down into two categories: life sciences and physical sciences.\n\nLife science refers to things like biology or human anatomy, in other words, sciences that revolve around all living things on Earth.\n\nPhysical science covers the rest of the natural sciences, like chemistry and physics, for example, so the areas that aren’t directly related to life.\n\nStill, there are five primary branches that make up natural sciences, with each one falling into one of these two categories.\n\nThe Five Main Branches of Natural Science\n\n\n\nSource: Unsplash Alt text: beakers in a lab used by chemists who study natural science\n\nJust as social science has different branches like psychology, history, or anthropology, natural science also has different branches. Let’s take a closer look at each one to understand what they entail.\n\n1. Biology\n\nAs we established earlier, biology falls under the life sciences category since it deals with living organisms on earth. Biologists can study a variety of different types of lives, from humans to animals, plants, or even microorganisms.\n\nBiology seeks to understand the lives of all organisms, such as their physical being as well as their place in the world and how they interact with the environment.\n\nThere are many different topics you can study that fall under the umbrella of biologies, such as food science, animal biology, agriculture, or human biology.\n\n2. Chemistry\n\nChemistry works with matter and studies how atoms come together and react to each other. Part of chemistry is researching things like chemical behavior, reactions, properties of different matter, their structure, and composition.\n\nChemists will perform experiments to study how matter bonds or interacts with each other for the purpose of discovery.\n\nThere are a lot of different things you can accomplish with chemistry, like creating new medicines, studying chemicals in the environment, and creating new compounds.\n\n3. Earth Sciences\n\nEarth sciences is one branch of natural science, but it itself is made up of a few different types of sciences, namely geology, oceanography, geography, atmospheric sciences, and planetary science.\n\nEach one of these focuses on a different area of what makes the earth what it is. For example, atmospheric scientists work closely with climate scientists to look at the world’s atmosphere and its effect on the ecosystem.\n\nAll the earth science fields look at different natural phenomena that occur on Earth and aim to understand them better.\n\n4. Physics\n\nPhysics is the study of the properties of matter and energy. In physics, scientists look at aspects of motion, force, time, energy, space, and more to understand how the world works.\n\nPhysicists can study many different elements relating to nature and energy and might focus on topics like how heat and light work, radiation, mechanics, electricity, and more.\n\nIn fact, within physics, you can study something as small as atom structure or something as large as galaxies.\n\n5. Space Sciences\n\nThis will also be referred to by some as astronomy, but it’s a lot more than just astronomy since space sciences involve everything from studying planets to planning space exploration.\n\nThere’s so much still unknown about the universe beyond planet Earth, and this branch of science is focused on learning more about all the natural phenomena that occur in space.\n\nSome of the topics that make up space sciences are fields like aerospace engineering, cosmology, astrobiology, planetary science, and more.\n\nWhat Does Studying Natural Science Involve?\n\nLike many subjects in the field of science, you’ll need to have a good understanding of mathematics. Many subjects like physics and chemistry used advanced mathematics to work on experiments.\n\nThe number of degrees you need might depend on the field you choose to study in, but in general, your focus will begin to narrow the further you get into your studies. You can start off by studying more than one of the natural sciences, and then, as your interests change, you’ll begin to narrow down your field of study as you go into a master’s or PhD program.\n\nCommon Natural Science Courses\n\nThis list will give you a small taste of some of the courses you might be able to take when you study one or more of the branches of natural science. Of course, this list isn’t exhaustive as the topics you can study are vast and varied, but this should give you a good idea of what to expect.\n\nTo Wrap Up\n\nNatural science involves five different branches that are each made up of thrilling fields of science. Each one serves its own purpose and is meant to look at a different element of our world, but when pieced together, it shows us a bigger picture of the universe and of ourselves.\n\nIf you’re interested in both natural and social sciences, we suggest finding a field of study that combines the two. At University of the People (UoPeople), we offer a Health Science degree where you can study natural sciences, like biology and human anatomy, and social sciences, like sociology. The best part? This bachelor’s degree is entirely tuition-free and can be done entirely online.",

However, studying nature to understand it purely for its own sake seems to have had its start among the pre-Socratic philosophers of the 6th century BCE, such as Thales and Anaximander.\n\nHow is science related to math?\nScience uses mathematics extensively as a powerful tool in the further understanding of phenomena. Sometimes scientific discoveries have inspired mathematicians, and at other times scientists have realized that forms of mathematics that were developed without any regard for their usefulness could be applied to understanding the physical world.\n\nWhere was science invented?\nAll peoples have studied the natural world, but most ancient peoples studied it for practical purposes, such as paying attention to natural cycles to know when to plant crops. It does not seem to have been until the 6th century BCE that the pre-Socratic philosophers (who lived in what is now Turkey and Greece) began seeking to understand nature as an end in itself.\nNews •\nAntibody therapy provides protection against severe H5N1 avian flu in monkeys • Jan. 31, 2025, 12:25 AM ET (News-Medical) ...(Show more)\nImmune cells orchestrate glucagon production during fasting • Jan. 16, 2025, 5:49 PM ET (News-Medical)\nNew NCERT textbooks will connect Science and Maths with arts, music: Manjul Bhargava • Jan. 12, 2025, 12:08 AM ET (The Hindu)\nShow less\n\nUnderstanding scientific hypotheses, theories, and modelsKara Rogers, senior biomedical sciences editor of Encyclopædia Britannica, discussing the difference between a scientific hypothesis and a scientific theory.(more)\nSee all videos for this article\nscience, any system of knowledge that is concerned with the physical world and its phenomena and that entails unbiased observations and systematic experimentation.

Nurses comprise the largest component of most healthcare environments.[2][3] There are shortages of qualified nurses in many countries.[4]\n\nNurses develop a plan of care, working collaboratively with physicians, therapists, patients, patients' families, and other team members that focuses on treating illness to improve quality of life.\n\nIn the United Kingdom and the United States, clinical nurse specialists and nurse practitioners diagnose health problems and prescribe medications and other therapies, depending on regulations that vary by state.[5] Nurses may help coordinate care performed by other providers or act independently as nursing professionals. In addition to providing care and support, nurses educate the public and promote health and wellness.[6]\n\nIn the U.S., nurse practitioners are nurses with a graduate degree in advanced practice nursing, and are permitted to prescribe medications. They practice independently in a variety of settings in more than half of the United States. In the postwar period, nurse education has diversified, awarding advanced and specialized credentials, and many traditional regulations and roles are changing.[7][8]\n\nHistory\n\nPremodern\n\nNursing historians face challenges of determining whether care provided to the sick or injured in antiquity is called nursing care.[9] In the fifth century BC, for example, the Hippocratic Collection in places described skilled care and observation of patients by male \"attendants,\" who may have provided care now provided by nurses.[10] Around 600 BC in India, it is recorded in Sushruta Samhita, Book 3, Chapter V about the role of the nurse[citation needed] as \"the different parts or members of the body as mentioned before including the skin, cannot be correctly described by one who is not well versed in anatomy. Hence, anyone desirous of acquiring a thorough knowledge of anatomy should prepare a dead body and carefully, observe, by dissecting it, and examining its different parts.\"\n\nIn the Middle Ages, members of religious orders such as nuns and monks often provided nursing-like care.[11] Examples exist in Christian,[12] Islamic,[13] Buddhist,[14] and other traditions. The biblical figure of Phoebe is described in many sources as \"the first visiting nurse\".[15][16] These traditions were influential in the development of the ethos of modern nursing. Its religious roots remain in evidence in many countries. One example in the United Kingdom is the use of the historical title \"sister\" to refer to a senior nurse.[17]\n\nDuring the Reformation, Protestant reformers shut down monasteries and convents, allowing a few hundred municipal hospices to remain in operation in northern Europe. Nuns who had been serving as nurses were given pensions or told to marry and stay home.[18] Nursing care went to the inexperienced as traditional caretakers, rooted in the Roman Catholic Church, were removed from their positions. The nursing profession in Europe was extinguished for approximately 200 years.[19]\n\n19th century\n\nDuring the Crimean War, Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna called for women to join the Order of Exaltation of the Cross (Krestodvizhenskaya Obshchina) for a year of service in military hospitals. The first section of twenty-eight \"sisters\", headed by Aleksandra Petrovna Stakhovich, the Directress of the Order, reached Crimea early in November 1854.[20]\n\nFlorence Nightingale laid the foundations of professional nursing after the Crimean War,[22] in light of a comprehensive statistical study she made of sanitation in India, leading her to emphasize the importance of sanitation. \"After 10 years of sanitary reform, in 1873, Nightingale reported that mortality among the soldiers in India had declined from 69 to 18 per 1,000\".[23]: 107\n\nNightingale believed that nursing was a social freedom and mission for women. She believed that any educated woman could help improve the care of the ill.[24] Her Notes on Nursing (1859) was a popular call to action. The Nightingale model of nursing education led to one of the first schools of nursing to be connected to a hospital and medical school. It spread widely in Europe and North America after 1870.[25]\n\nNightingale included five factors that helped nurses in her time who worked amidst poor sanitation and little education. These factors include fresh air, clean water, a working drainage system, cleanliness, and good light. Nightingale believed that a clean working environment was important in caring for patients. In the 19th century, this theory was ideal for helping patients, providing a guide for nurses to alter the environment around patients for the betterment of their health.[26]\n\nNightingale's recommendations built upon the successes of Jamaican \"doctresses\" such as Mary Seacole, who like Nightingale, served in the Crimean War. Seacole practised hygiene and the use of herbs in healing wounded soldiers and those suffering from diseases in the 19th century in the Crimea, Central America, and Jamaica. Her predecessors had great success as healers in the Colony of Jamaica in the 18th century, and they included Seacole's mother (Mrs. Grant), Sarah Adams, Cubah Cornwallis, and Grace Donne, the mistress and doctress to Jamaica's wealthiest planter, Simon Taylor.[27]\n\nOther important nurses in the development of the profession include:\n\nRed Cross chapters, which began appearing after the establishment of the International Committee of the Red Cross in 1863, offered employment and professionalization opportunities for nurses (despite Nightingale's initial objections).[29] Catholic orders such as Little Sisters of the Poor, Sisters of Mercy, Sisters of St. Mary, St. Francis Health Services, Inc. and Sisters of Charity built hospitals and provided nursing services during this period.[citation needed][30] The modern deaconess movement began in Germany in 1836.[31] Within a half century, over 5,000 deaconesses had surfaced in Europe.[32]\n\nFormal use of nurses in the military began in the latter half of the nineteenth century. Nurses saw active duty in the First Boer War, the Egyptian Campaign (1882),[33] and the Sudan Campaign (1883).[34]\n\n20th century\n\nIn the 19th and early 20th century, nursing was considered a woman's profession, just as doctoring was a profession for men. With increasing expectations of workplace equality during the late 20th century, nursing became an officially gender-neutral profession, though in practice the percentage of male nurses remained well below that of female physicians in the 21st century.[35][36]\n\nHospital-based training became standard in the US in the early 1900s, with an emphasis on practical experience. The Nightingale-style school began to disappear. Hospitals and physicians saw women in nursing as a source of free/inexpensive labor. Exploitation of nurses was not uncommon by employers, physicians, and education providers.[37]\n\nMany nurses saw active duty in the First World War, but the profession transformed again during the Second World War. British nurses of the Army Nursing Service were part of every overseas campaign.",

Nursing is also responsible for encouraging the health of individuals, families, and communities in medical and community settings. Nurses are actively involved in health care research, management, policy deliberations, and patient advocacy. Nurses with postbaccalaureate preparation assume independent responsibility for providing primary health care and specialty services to individuals, families, and communities.\n\nProfessional nurses work both independently and in collaboration with other health care professionals such as physicians. Professional nurses supervise the work of nurses who have limited licenses, such as licensed practical nurses (LPNs) in the United States and enrolled nurses (ENs) in Australia. Professional nurses also oversee the work of nursing assistants in various settings.\n\nNursing is the largest, the most diverse, and one of the most respected of all the health care professions. There are more than 2.9 million registered nurses in the United States alone, and many more millions worldwide. While true demographic representation remains an elusive goal, nursing does have a higher proportional representation of racial and ethnic minorities than other health care professions. In some countries, however, men still remain significantly underrepresented.\n\nThe demand for nursing remains high, and projections suggest that such demand will substantively increase. Advances in health care technology, rising expectations of people seeking care, and reorganization of health care systems require a greater number of highly educated professionals. Demographic changes, such as large aging populations in many countries of the world, also fuel this demand.\n\nHistory of nursing\n\nAlthough the origins of nursing predate the mid-19th century, the history of professional nursing traditionally begins with Florence Nightingale. Nightingale, the well-educated daughter of wealthy British parents, defied social conventions and decided to become a nurse. The nursing of strangers, either in hospitals or in their homes, was not then seen as a respectable career for well-bred ladies, who, if they wished to nurse, were expected to do so only for sick family and intimate friends. In a radical departure from these views, Nightingale believed that well-educated women, using scientific principles and informed education about healthy lifestyles, could dramatically improve the care of sick patients. Moreover, she believed that nursing provided an ideal independent calling full of intellectual and social freedom for women, who at that time had few other career options.\n\nIn 1854 Nightingale had the opportunity to test her beliefs during Britain’s Crimean War. Newspaper stories reporting that sick and wounded Russian soldiers nursed by religious orders fared much better than British soldiers inflamed public opinion. In response, the British government asked Nightingale to take a small group of nurses to the military hospital at Scutari (modern-day Üsküdar, Turk.). Within days of their arrival, Nightingale and her nurses had reorganized the barracks hospital in accordance with 19th-century science: walls were scrubbed for sanitation, windows opened for ventilation, nourishing food prepared and served, and medications and treatments efficiently administered. Within weeks death rates plummeted, and soldiers were no longer sickened by infectious diseases arising from poor sanitary conditions. Within months a grateful public knew of the work of the “Lady with the Lamp,” who made nightly rounds comforting the sick and wounded. By the end of the 19th century, the entire Western world shared Nightingale’s belief in the worth of educated nurses.\n\nNightingale’s achievements overshadowed other ways to nurse the sick. For centuries, most nursing of the sick had taken place at home and had been the responsibility of families, friends, and respected community members with reputations as effective healers. During epidemics, such as cholera, typhus, and smallpox, men took on active nursing roles. For example, Stephen Girard, a wealthy French-born banker, won the hearts of citizens of his adopted city of Philadelphia for his courageous and compassionate nursing of the victims of the 1793 yellow fever epidemic.\n\nAs urbanization and industrialization spread, those without families to care for them found themselves in hospitals where the quality of nursing care varied enormously. Some patients received excellent care. Women from religious nursing orders were particularly known for the quality of the nursing care they provided in the hospitals they established. Other hospitals depended on recovering patients or hired men and women for the nursing care of patients. Sometimes this care was excellent; other times it was deplorable, and the unreliability of hospital-based nursing care became a particular problem by the late 19th century, when changes in medical practices and treatments required competent nurses. The convergence of hospitals’ needs, physicians’ wishes, and women’s desire for meaningful work led to a new health care professional: the trained nurse.\n\nHospitals established their own training schools for nurses. In exchange for lectures and clinical instructions, students provided the hospital with two or three years of skilled free nursing care. This hospital-based educational model had significant long-term implications. It bound the education of nurses to hospitals rather than colleges, a tie that was not definitively broken until the latter half of the 20th century. The hospital-based training model also reinforced segregation in society and in the health care system. For instance, African American student nurses were barred from almost all American hospitals and training schools. They could seek training only in schools established by African American hospitals. Most of all, the hospital-based training model strengthened the cultural stereotyping of nursing as women’s work. Only a few hospitals provided training to maintain men’s traditional roles within nursing.\n\nStill, nurses transformed hospitals. In addition to the skilled, compassionate care they gave to patients, they established an orderly, routine, and systemized environment within which patients healed. They administered increasingly complicated treatments and medication regimes. They maintained the aseptic and infection-control protocols that allowed more complex and invasive surgeries to proceed. In addition, they experimented with different models of nursing interventions that humanized increasingly technical and impersonal medical procedures.\n\nOutside hospitals, trained nurses quickly became critical in the fight against infectious diseases. In the early 20th century, the newly discovered “germ theory” of disease (the knowledge that many illnesses were caused by bacteria) caused considerable alarm in countries around the world. Teaching methods of preventing the spread of diseases, such as tuberculosis, pneumonia, and influenza, became the domain of the visiting nurses in the United States and the district nurses in the United Kingdom and Europe. These nurses cared for infected patients in the patients’ homes and taught families and communities the measures necessary to prevent spreading the infection. They were particularly committed to working with poor and immigrant communities, which often had little access to other health care services. The work of these nurses contributed to a dramatic decline in the mortality and morbidity rates from infectious diseases for children and adults.\n\nAt the same time, independent contractors called private-duty nurses cared for sick individuals in their homes.",

It includes the promotion of health, the prevention of illness, and the care of ill, disabled and dying people. Nurses play a critical role in health care and are often the unsung heroes in health care facilities and emergency response. They are often the first to detect health emergencies and work on the front lines of disease prevention and the delivery of primary health care, including promotion, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation.\n\nIn many countries, nurses make up half of all health care professionals and have a vital role in how health actions are organized and applied, both at the front-line and managerial levels.  They are often the first and sometimes only health professional a patient will see and the quality of their initial assessment and subsequent care is vital to strong health outcomes.\n\nDespite the critical role they play in health care, there is a shortage of nurses worldwide that is expected to rise as the population grows. Initiatives to expand health care services, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, are succeeding in providing access to previously underserved communities, which furthers the need for trained nurses. Every country needs a competent, motivated, well-distributed and supported health workforce as part of the global drive for universal health coverage, and nurses are central to these efforts.\n\nNurses and midwives account for nearly 50% of the global health workforce. However, they also represent 50% of the global shortage of health workers, which is estimated at 4 million. Since in most countries nurses and midwives form the bulk\r\n    of the clinical health workforce, developing and strengthening human resources for health means recognizing that nursing and midwifery services play a vital role in improving health service delivery. Nursing also represents a significant share of\r\n    the female workforce; globally, 70% of health and social workers are women. Achieving the goal of health care for all will require huge efforts to reduce the shortage of health workers around the world.\n\nWHO recognizes the vital role that nurses play in primary\r\n    health care delivery worldwide – including research, disease prevention,\r\n    treating the injured, palliative care and more – which is represented through\r\n    several World Health Assembly resolutions.

She was appointed to the role in December 2022, taking over from Elizabeth Iro, the first Chief Nursing Officer at WHO, who held the position from 2017-2022. A key role of the Office is to provide leadership to nurses and midwives worldwide.\n\nThrough the Department of Human Resources for Health (HRH), WHO works on many fronts to promote the role of nurses in health care delivery and expand the global health work force. The Department aims to facilitate the integration of nursing and midwifery services into other WHO programmes and provide evidence-based information on the global health workforce to assist countries and partners in collaborate efforts. WHO also supports technical efforts for capacity building at both the policy level and through in-country programmes, and works to forge networks and effective partnerships to help meet the global need for health care workers.\n\nNews\n\nWHO launches new guide to help boost quality in health services\n\nBuilding a healthier world by women and for women is key to achieving gender equality\n\nWorld Health Day 2025 to spotlight women and babies’ survival, urging solidarity at a critical moment for global health\n\nNew study measuring laws protecting health and care workers highlights innovations and gaps\n\nLatest publications\n\nWHO recommendations on maternal health: guidelines approved by the WHO Guidelines Review Committee, 2nd...\n\nThis document provides a summary of all WHO recommendations on maternal health based on guidelines approved by the WHO Guidelines Review Committee.

Absenteeism is habitual absence from work.\n\nDirect care - Care provided personally by a member of staff. May involve any aspect of health care including treatments, counselling and education regarding people who use services. \n\nIndirect care - Nursing interventions that are performed to benefit people who use services but do not involve direct contact with these individuals and communities.\n\nIndependent employer - Any independent contractor, employer organisations that may or may not be commissioned by the public sector. This will include private health care providers, most social care providers; GP practices; out of hours/call centres; social enterprises and community interest companies; charities, private surgical, mental health and learning disability hospitals; independent treatment centres; public/private schools; private industry.\n\nMissed care - Required care for people who use or need services that is omitted in part or fully, or care that is delayed. \n\nNurse-patient/staff ratios - Number of people who need or use services assigned to an individual or team of nurses; based upon the acuity and/or dependency of the service user for nursing care.\n\nNurse retention - A strategy which focuses on preventing nurse turnover and keeping nurses in an organisation's employment.\n\nNursing establishment - The total number of staff to provide sufficient resource to deploy a planned roster that will enable nurses to provide care to people who need or use services that meets all reasonable requirements in the relevant situation. This includes: a resource to cover all staff absences, and other staff functions that reduce the time available to care for people who need services. Supernumerary persons such as students and sisters/charge nurses/managers should not be included in the planned roster.\n\nNurse staffing - Rota and whole time equivalent (WTE) for a nursing team. The nurse staffing level refers to both the required establishment and the actual staffing level per shift/allocated workday. The maintenance of the nurse staffing level should be funded from the organisation’s revenue allocation. \n\nNursing workforce - The total number of nursing staff, of all levels of experience and qualification, currently working within an organisation, sector or country. \n\nPatient acuity - Acuity can be defined as the measurement of the intensity of nursing care that is required by a person in need of service. An acuity-based staffing system regulates the number of nurses on a shift according to the individual's needs and not according to numbers of people who use or need services.\n\nPatient/client dependency - Measuring the differing reliance of individual people who use services on nursing staff, a means to classify patients in order to predict staffing needs.",

      "raw_content": "Jean Watson: Theory of Human Caring\n\nUpdated on\n\nApril 30, 2024\n\nBy\n\nAngelo Gonzalo, BSN, RN\n\nContents\n\nDr. Jean Watson is a nurse theorist who developed “Philosophy and Theory of Transpersonal Caring” or “Caring Science” and founder of Watson Caring Science Institute. Get to know about Dr. Watson’s nursing theory, its major concepts, assumptions, and application to nursing in this study guide.\n\nBiography of Jean Watson\n\nJean Watson (June 10, 1940 – present) is an American nurse theorist and nursing professor known for her “Philosophy and Theory of Transpersonal Caring.” She has also written numerous texts, including Nursing: The Philosophy and Science of Caring. Watson’s study on caring has been integrated into education and patient care to various nursing schools and healthcare facilities worldwide.\n\nEarly Life\n\nJean Watson was born Margaret Jean Harmon and grew up in Welch, West Virginia, in the Appalachian Mountains. She was the youngest of eight children and was surrounded by an extended family–community environment. Watson attended high school in West Virginia and then the Lewis Gale School of Nursing in Roanoke, Virginia, where she graduated in 1961.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nAfter her graduation in 1961, Jean Watson married her husband, Douglas, and moved west to his native state of Colorado. In 1997, she experienced an accidental injury that resulted in the loss of her left eye, and soon after, in 1998, her husband, whom she considers as her physical and spiritual partner, and her best friend passed away and left Watson and their two grown daughters, Jennifer and Julie, and five grandchildren.\n\nWatson states that she is “attempting to integrate these wounds into my life and work. One of the gifts through the suffering was the privilege of experiencing and receiving my own theory through the care from my husband and loving nurse friends and colleagues.” These two personal life-altering events contributed to writing her third book, Postmodern Nursing and Beyond.\n\nEducation\n\nJean Watson ardently and quickly progressed through her nursing education, earning her bachelor’s degree in nursing in 1964, a master of science in psychiatric and mental health nursing in 1966, and a Ph.D. in educational psychology and counseling in 1973, all from the University of Colorado at Boulder.\n\nCareer and Appointments\n\nAfter Jean Watson concluded her doctoral degree, she has served in both faculty and administrative positions in the School of Nursing faculty, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver. In 1981 and 1982, she pursued international sabbatical studies in New Zealand, Australia, India, Thailand, and Taiwan.\n\nIn the 1980s, Watson and colleagues established the Center for Human Caring at the University of Colorado, the nation’s first interdisciplinary center committed to using human caring knowledge for clinical practice, scholarship, administration, and leadership. At the center, Watson and others sponsor clinical, educational, and community scholarship activities and human caring projects. These activities involve national and international scholars in residence and international connections with colleagues around the world, such as Australia, Brazil, Canada, Korea, Japan, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Scandinavia, Thailand, and Venezuela, among others. Activities such as these continue at the University of Colorado’s International Certificate Program in Caring Healing, where Watson offers her theory courses for doctoral students.\n\nWatson served as chairperson and assistant dean of the undergraduate program at the University of Colorado School of Nursing. She was involved in the planning and implementing of the nursing Ph.D. program and served as coordinator and director of the Ph.D. program between 1978 and 1981. From 1983 to 1990, she was Dean of University of Colorado School of Nursing and Associate Director of Nursing Practice at University Hospital. During her deanship, she was instrumental in developing a post-baccalaureate nursing curriculum in human caring, health, and healing that led to a Nursing Doctorate (ND), a professional clinical doctoral degree that in 2005 became the Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) degree.\n\nBetween 1993 and 1996, Watson served as a member of the Executive Committee and the Governing Board and as an officer for the NLN, and she was elected president from 1995 to 1996.\n\nIn 2005, she took a sabbatical for a walking pilgrimage in the Spanish El Camino. And in 2008, Watson created a non-profit foundation: Watson Caring Science Institute, to further the work of Caring Science in the world.\n\nPhilosophy and Theory of Transpersonal Caring\n\nWatson’s Philosophy and Science of Caring is concerned with how nurses express care to their patients. Her theory stresses the humanistic aspects of nursing as they intertwine with scientific knowledge and nursing practice.\n\nThe nursing model states that “nursing is concerned with promoting health, preventing illness, caring for the sick, and restoring health.” It focuses on health promotion, as well as the treatment of diseases. According to Watson, caring is central to nursing practice and promotes health better than a simple medical cure. She believes that a holistic approach to health care is central to the practice of caring in nursing.\n\nAccording to her theory, caring can be demonstrated and practiced by nurses. Caring for patients promotes growth; a caring environment accepts a person as they are and looks to what they may become.\n\nWatson also defined three of the four metaparadigm concepts in nursing, including the person or human being, health, and nursing. She referred to the human beings as a valued person in and of themselves to be cared for, respected, nurtured, understood, and assisted; in general, a person’s philosophical view as a fully functional integrated self. A human is viewed as greater than and different from the sum of his or her parts. Meanwhile, health is defined as a high level of overall physical, mental, and social functioning, a general adaptive-maintenance level of daily functioning, the absence of illness, or the presence of efforts leading to the absence of illness. And nursing is a science of persons and health-illness experience mediated by professional, personal, scientific, and ethical care interactions.\n\nShe does not define the fourth metaparadigm concept of the environment but instead devised 10 caring needs specific carative factors critical to the caring human experience that need to be addressed by nurses with their patients when in a caring role.\n\n10 Carative Factors\n\nWatson’s 10 carative factors are: (1) forming humanistic-altruistic value systems, (2) instilling faith-hope, (3) cultivating a sensitivity to self and others, (4) developing a helping-trust relationship, (5) promoting an expression of feelings, (6) using problem-solving for decision-making, (7) promoting teaching-learning, (8) promoting a supportive environment, (9) assisting with the gratification of human needs, and (10) allowing for existential-phenomenological forces. The first three factors form the “philosophical foundation” for the science of caring, and the remaining seven come from that foundation.\n\nIn assisting with the gratification of human needs, Watson’s hierarchy of needs begins with lower-order biophysical needs or survival needs, including the need for food and fluid, elimination, and ventilation. Next are the lower-order psychophysical needs or functional needs, including the need for activity, inactivity, and sexuality. The higher-order psychosocial needs or integrative needs include the need for achievement and affiliation. And finally, the higher-order intrapersonal-interpersonal need or growth-seeking need, which is self-actualization.\n\nThe nursing process outlined in Watson’s model contains the same steps as the scientific research process: assessment, plan, intervention, and evaluation.",

The concept of health takes into account physical, psychological, and social well-being, among other factors.[4]\nPublic health is an interdisciplinary field. For example, epidemiology, biostatistics, social sciences and management of health services are all relevant. Other important sub-fields include environmental health, community health, behavioral health, health economics, public policy, mental health, health education, health politics, occupational safety, disability, oral health, gender issues in health, and sexual and reproductive health.[5] Public health, together with primary care, secondary care, and tertiary care, is part of a country's overall healthcare system. Public health is implemented through the surveillance of cases and health indicators, and through the promotion of healthy behaviors. Common public health initiatives include promotion of hand-washing and breastfeeding, delivery of vaccinations, promoting ventilation and improved air quality both indoors and outdoors, suicide prevention, smoking cessation, obesity education, increasing healthcare accessibility and distribution of condoms to control the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.\nThere is a significant disparity in access to health care and public health initiatives between developed countries and developing countries, as well as within developing countries. In developing countries, public health infrastructures are still forming. There may not be enough trained healthcare workers, monetary resources, or, in some cases, sufficient knowledge to provide even a basic level of medical care and disease prevention.[6][7] A major public health concern in developing countries is poor maternal and child health, exacerbated by malnutrition and poverty coupled with governments' reluctance in implementing public health policies. Developed nations are at greater risk of certain public health crises, including childhood obesity, although overweight populations in low- and middle-income countries are catching up.[8]\nFrom the beginnings of human civilization, communities promoted health and fought disease at the population level.[9][10] In complex, pre-industrialized societies, interventions designed to reduce health risks could be the initiative of different stakeholders, such as army generals, the clergy or rulers. Great Britain became a leader in the development of public health initiatives, beginning in the 19th century, due to the fact that it was the first modern urban nation worldwide.[11] The public health initiatives that began to emerge initially focused on sanitation (for example, the Liverpool and London sewerage systems), control of infectious diseases (including vaccination and quarantine) and an evolving infrastructure of various sciences, e.g. statistics, microbiology, epidemiology, sciences of engineering.[11]\nDefinition[edit]\nA community health worker in Korail Basti, a slum in Dhaka, Bangladesh\nPublic health has been defined as \"the science and art of preventing disease\", prolonging life and improving quality of life through organized efforts and informed choices of society, organizations (public and private), communities and individuals.[2] The public can be as small as a handful of people or as large as a village or an entire city. The concept of health takes into account physical, psychological, and social well-being. As such, according to the World Health Organization, \"health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\".[4]\nRelated terms[edit]\nThe WHO is the predominant agency associated with global health.\nPublic health is related to global health which is the health of populations in the worldwide context.[12] It has been defined as \"the area of study, research and practice that places a priority on improving health and achieving equity in \"Health for all\" people worldwide\".[13] International health is a field of health care, usually with a public health emphasis, dealing with health across regional or national boundaries.[14] Public health is not the same as public healthcare (publicly funded health care).\nThe term preventive medicine is related to public health. The American Board of Preventive Medicine separates three categories of preventive medicine: aerospace health, occupational health, and public health and general preventative medicine. Jung, Boris and Lushniak argue that preventive medicine should be considered the medical specialty for public health but note that the American College of Preventive Medicine and American Board of Preventive Medicine do not prominently use the term \"public health\".[15]: 1  Preventive medicine specialists are trained as clinicians and address complex health needs of a population such as by assessing the need for disease prevention programs, using the best methods to implement them, and assessing their effectiveness.[15]: 1, 3 \nSince the 1990s many scholars in public health have been using the term population health.[16]: 3  There are no medical specialties directly related to population health.[15]: 4  Valles argues that consideration of health equity is a fundamental part of population health. Scholars such as Coggon and Pielke express concerns about bringing general issues of wealth distribution into population health. Pielke worries about \"stealth issue advocacy\" in population health.[16]: 163  Jung, Boris and Lushniak consider population health to be a concept that is the goal of an activity called public health practiced through the specialty preventive medicine.[15]: 4 \nLifestyle medicine uses individual lifestyle modification to prevent or revert disease and can be considered a component of preventive medicine and public health. It is implemented as part of primary care rather than a specialty in its own right.[15]: 3  Valles argues that the term social medicine has a narrower and more biomedical focus than the term population health.[16]: 7 \nPurpose[edit]\nThe purpose of a public health intervention is to prevent and mitigate diseases, injuries, and other health conditions. The overall goal is to improve the health of individuals and populations, and to increase life expectancy.[17][18]\nComponents[edit]\nPublic health is a complex term, composed of many elements and different practices. It is a multi-faceted, interdisciplinary field.[11] For example, epidemiology, biostatistics, social sciences and management of health services are all relevant. Other important sub-fields include environmental health, community health, behavioral health, health economics, public policy, mental health, health education, health politics, occupational safety, disability, gender issues in health, and sexual and reproductive health.",

From the normal human interactions involved in dealing with the many problems of social life, there has emerged a recognition of the importance of community action in the promotion of health and the prevention and treatment of disease, and this is expressed in the concept of public health.\n\nComparable terms for public health medicine are social medicine and community medicine; the latter has been widely adopted in the United Kingdom, and the practitioners are called community physicians. The practice of public health draws heavily on medical science and philosophy and concentrates especially on manipulating and controlling the environment for the benefit of the public. It is concerned therefore with housing, water supplies, and food. Noxious agents can be introduced into these through farming, fertilizers, inadequate sewage disposal and drainage, construction, defective heating and ventilating systems, machinery, and toxic chemicals. Public health medicine is part of the greater enterprise of preserving and improving the public health. Community physicians cooperate with diverse groups, from architects, builders, sanitary and heating and ventilating engineers, and factory and food inspectors to psychologists and sociologists, chemists, physicists, and toxicologists. Occupational medicine is concerned with the health, safety, and welfare of persons in the workplace. It may be viewed as a specialized part of public health medicine since its aim is to reduce the risks in the environment in which persons work.\n\nThe venture of preserving, maintaining, and actively promoting public health requires special methods of information-gathering (epidemiology) and corporate arrangements to act upon significant findings and put them into practice. Statistics collected by epidemiologists attempt to describe and explain the occurrence of disease in a population by correlating factors such as diet, environment, radiation exposure, or cigarette smoking with the incidence and prevalence of disease. The government, through laws and regulations, creates agencies to oversee and formally inspect and monitor water supplies, food processing, sewage treatment, drains, and pollution. Governments also are concerned with the control of epidemic and pandemic diseases, establishing guidelines for appropriate medical responses and isolation procedures, and issuing travel warnings to prevent the spread of disease from affected areas.\n\nVarious public health agencies have been established to help control and monitor disease within societies, on both national and international levels. For example, the United Kingdom’s Public Health Act of 1848 established a special public health ministry for England and Wales. In the United States, public health is studied and coordinated on a national level by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Internationally, the World Health Organization (WHO) plays an equivalent role. WHO is especially important in providing assistance for the implementation of organizational and administrative methods of handling problems associated with health and disease in less-developed countries worldwide. Within these countries, health problems, limitations of resources, education of health personnel, and other factors must be taken into account in designing health service systems.\n\nAdvances in science and medicine in developed countries, including the generation of vaccines and antibiotics, have been fundamental in bringing vital aid to countries afflicted by a high burden of disease. Yet, despite the expansion of resources and improvements in the mobilization of these resources to the most severely afflicted areas, the incidence of preventable disease and of neglected tropical disease remains exceptionally high worldwide. Reducing the impact and prevalence of these diseases is a major goal of international public health. The persistence of such diseases in the world, however, serves as an important indication of the difficulties that health organizations and societies continue to confront.\n\nHistory of public health\n\nA review of the historical development of public health, which began in ancient times, emphasizes how various public health concepts have evolved. Historical public health measures included quarantine of leprosy victims in the Middle Ages and efforts to improve sanitation following the 14th-century plague epidemics. Population increases in Europe brought with them increased awareness of infant deaths and a proliferation of hospitals. These developments in turn led to the establishment of modern public health agencies and organizations, designed to control disease within communities and to oversee the availability and distribution of medicines.\n\nBeginnings in antiquity\n\nMost of the world’s ancient peoples practiced cleanliness and personal hygiene, often for religious reasons, including, apparently, a wish to be pure in the eyes of their gods. The Bible, for example, has many adjurations and prohibitions about clean and unclean living. Religion, law, and custom were inextricably interwoven. For thousands of years societies looked upon epidemics as divine judgments on the wickedness of humankind. The idea that pestilence is due to natural causes, such as climate and physical environment, however, gradually developed. This great advance in thought took place in Greece during the 5th and 4th centuries bce and represented the first attempt at a rational, scientific theory of disease causation. An association between malaria and swamps, for example, was established very early (503–403 bce), even though the reasons for the association were obscure. In the book Airs, Waters, and Places, thought to have been written by Greek physician Hippocrates in the 5th or 4th century bce, the first systematic attempt was made to set forth a causal relationship between human diseases and the environment. Until the new sciences of bacteriology and immunology emerged well into the 19th century, this book provided a theoretical basis for the comprehension of endemic disease (that persisting in a particular locality) and epidemic disease (that affecting a number of people within a relatively short period).\n\n",

Public health experts assess the needs of particular groups, or populations, rather than the needs of any one person. This makes public health different from healthcare, which involves diagnosing and treating individuals. Such a big-picture approach allows public health efforts to benefit lots of people at once — including you and those you love.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\n\nFor example, data might show that swimming pool accidents are a leading cause of injury or death for children in a certain community. In response, public health experts may help community leaders develop a plan to offer free swim classes. They may also craft educational materials on water safety for parents. Such changes can help you and your family in ways that complement advice from your pediatrician.\n\nPublic health experts don’t focus on one specific family or child. Instead, they zoom out to understand the health of entire populations. Over time, across many communities, this can have a big impact.\n\nWho works in public health?\n\nPublic health professionals, also sometimes called public health workers or experts, include:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat are public health issues?\n\nPublic health issues are aspects of the world around us that affect how long we live and/or our quality of life. Public health issues don’t affect everyone equally. That’s why experts typically study groups of people, defined by things like zip code, race or age. They want to understand what issues a certain group faces and how to make things better.\n\nIn an ideal world, we wouldn't have barriers to care. This means everyone has fair and equal access to the resources they need to support their health. We’re not there yet, but public health as a field is dedicated to moving us as far as possible in that direction.\n\nPublic health issues change over time. This is because new health risks can emerge. Plus, advances in medicine make some diseases less of a concern than they were in the past. Public health issues also vary by country.\n\nIn the U.S., public health experts are currently developing strategies to:\n\nThese are just some examples. Public health is a vast, far-reaching field. It addresses long-standing issues while also responding to emerging needs.\n\nWhat is the public health system?\n\nIn the U.S., the public health system is a large network of public health agencies at all levels of government. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lead public health efforts at the national level. There are also departments of public health at local, state, tribal and territorial levels that serve people in those areas.\n\nWhen it comes to public health, it truly takes a village to keep all the wheels turning. You might be familiar with your local health department or know about the CDC. But you might not know that these agencies partner with many other groups and organizations. For example, governmental health agencies might team up with:\n\nThis collaboration is vital for building a world where everyone gets the health services they need.\n\nWhat services does the public health system provide?\n\nThe public health system provides a broad range of services to try and give everyone a fair chance at being as healthy as possible.

Pursuing this major allows you to earn a Bachelor of Science in Public Health (BSPH) degree. After earning your BSPH, you may choose to earn your MPH or seek a job in the field.\n\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\n\nPublic health is a professional field, but it’s also so much more. It’s the combined efforts of people who look for opportunities to help others lead their healthiest possible lives. If you’re reading this and thinking, “I care about helping others stay healthy and safe,” then you’re already invested in public health. Even if you don’t have a degree or formal training, you can make a difference in others’ lives through what you say and do every day.\n\nFor example, if you know someone has trouble making it to medical appointments, offer to drive them. Set up weekly walks with a neighbor who says they’d like to move around more. Check on loved ones who live alone and bring a nutritious, home-cooked meal. Share educational resources with your family or friends.

Public health fulfills its mission through organized, interdisciplinary efforts that address the physical, mental, and environmental health concerns of communities and populations at risk for disease and injury.\n\nImage Credit: VectorMine/Shutterstock.com\n\nRooted in the foundational definitions of pioneers like C.E.A. Winslow and Donald Acheson, public health operates across diverse domains, from epidemiology's study of disease patterns to biostatistics' role in data-driven decision-making. Effective health service administration and governance ensure the equitable distribution of public health resources and services.\n\nWhat is public health?\n\nPublic health was defined by C.E.A. Winslow (1920) as \"the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life, and promoting health and efficiency through organized community efforts and informed choices of society, organizations, public and private communities, and individuals.\" 1\n\nIn 1988, Donald Achenson described public health as \"the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life, and promoting human health through organized efforts and informed choices of society, organizations (both public and private), communities, and individuals.\" 2\n\nThe following are the three main roles of public health: Identifying health issues and priorities by evaluating and monitoring the wellbeing of at-risk groups and communities; Creating public policies to address these regional and national health goals and concerns in partnership with community and government leaders; Ensuring that all populations have access to appropriate and affordable health promotion and disease prevention services, as well as monitoring the success of this care.3\n\nKey concepts and components of public health\n\nEpidemiology\n\nIn the scientific field of epidemiology, the distribution (frequency and pattern) and factors of health-related population events are examined, and this research is then applied to prevent and control health problems.\n\nThe epidemiologist's role involves gathering relevant data from the field, analyzing and summarizing complex epidemiological data, and developing various strategies for controlling and preventing health issues.4 They identify health issues within affected communities, determine the source and method of illness transmission, collect information from clinical studies and disease surveys, conduct interview studies, and examine intricate epidemiological data to conclude.\n\nEpidemiologists also develop action plans to address population health emergencies by producing reports that outline various disease factors. Another aspect of epidemiology involves presenting and disseminating epidemiological data to formulate public health policies. Their work forms the basis for numerous initiatives aimed at raising public health awareness.4\n\nImage Credit: Flash Vector/Shutterstock.com\n\nBiostatistics\n\nThe theoretical foundation for deriving knowledge from data, even in the face of unpredictability and uncertainty, comes from statistical reasoning.5 Most empirical research in clinical medicine and public health relies heavily on it; the greatest studies include biostatistical input on everything from study design to data analysis and reporting.\n\nBiostatistics involves complex problem-solving using mathematics, probability, and technological skills like computing. An understanding of the sources of bias, which form the foundation of statistical theory and methodology, is also essential. Developing these skills, along with the ability to conceptualize issues and navigate the complexities between intricate procedures and real-world health challenges, requires in-depth training. The fields of epidemiology and health services research heavily depend on biostatistical methods.5\n\nHealth service administration\n\nThe effective management of health services and the execution of policies are essential components of health service administration. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, health-service administrators in certain facilities are responsible for scheduling employees, hiring and onboarding new employees, and resource management. A health services administrator may be in charge of the facility's overall management in smaller settings.6\n\nHealth services administration is the discipline that integrates science, business, and policy to manage the financial and human resources required to provide high-quality public health services. Health systems are facing many difficulties in the current global health environment, such as population increase, aging populations, and rising rates of chronic illnesses.\n\nThis means that instead of focusing on acute interventions, health managers and leaders at the community level must adjust health services to prioritize long-term care and prevention. Increases in communicable and non-communicable diseases are occurring in countries all over the world, from Asia and Europe to Africa. This has an impact on how health systems must develop and distribute resources.7\n\nFor societies to perform vital public health tasks, they need to have the necessary infrastructure and resources in place. This system, which is led by public health service administration and governance, makes up the infrastructure of public health. In order to accomplish the fundamental tasks of public health, governance and management collaborate.8\n\nEnvironmental health\n\nOur health is impacted by the environment in many different ways. Human health can be greatly impacted by events connected to climate change or environmental contaminants. Up to 24% of all fatalities globally in 2016 were linked to environmental factors. A few of the contributing factors are growing heat waves and extreme weather, air, water, and sanitation pollution, hazardous chemical exposure, and more. Estimating the disease burden resulting from environmental variables requires knowledge of exposure and exposure-response interactions.9\n\nThe ability of ecosystems to deliver commodities and services that can be converted into economic advantages for humans, such as values linked to improving health and reducing mortality, is threatened by climate change and anthropogenic forcing. Human health is already suffering from the detrimental effects of this deterioration, and things could get much worse over the next 50 years.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nPolicies pertaining to the environment and health should be linked because of their close relationship. Improving air quality and ensuring sufficient sources of safe drinking water have a substantial positive impact on people's health and wellbeing. Bathing water quality is also found to have significant societal advantages, which justifies the expenditures of abatement measures. Mitigating the effects of climate change is crucial for improving public health.10\n\nSocial and behavioral sciences\n\nPublic health outcomes are frequently shaped by individual behavioral patterns, even though the influence of public health is measured at the population level. Policymakers and practitioners can benefit from behavioral science's understanding of how and why various groups choose behaviors, as well as how those choices can either lessen or increase inequality. Behavioral science can help enhance the whole healthcare system and produce positive health outcomes. 11\n\nThe majority of today's public health issues are related to community and individual habits, which differ greatly depending on the situation. Sneezing into one's elbow, for instance, might be a personal, reflexive habit that uses minimal outside resources.",

      "raw_content": "Health promotion\n\n“Health promotion is the process of enabling people to increase control over, and to improve their health.” Health Promotion Glossary, 1998\n\nA brief history of Health Promotion\n\nThe first International Conference on Health Promotion was held in Ottawa in 1986, and was primarily a response to growing expectations for a new public health movement around the world. It launched a series of actions among international organizations, national governments and local communities to achieve the goal of \"Health For All\" by the year 2000 and beyond. The basic strategies for health promotion identified in the Ottawa Charter were: advocate (to boost the factors which encourage health), enable (allowing all people to achieve health equity) and mediate (through collaboration across all sectors).\n\nSince then, the WHO Global Health Promotion Conferences have established and developed the global principles and action areas for health promotion. Most recently, the 9th global conference (Shanghai 2016), titled ‘Promoting health in the Sustainable Development Goals: Health for all and all for health’, highlighted the critical links between promoting health and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Whilst calling for bold political interventions to accelerate country action on the SDGs, the Shanghai Declaration provides a framework through which governments can utilize the transformational potential of health promotion.\n\n\n\nPromoting Healthier Populations\n\nThe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provides a bold and ambitious agenda for the future. WHO is committed to helping the world meet the SDGs by championing health across all the goals. WHO’s core mission is to promote health, alongside keeping the world safe and serving the vulnerable. Beyond fighting disease, we will work to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages, leaving no-one behind.\n\nOur target is 1 billion more people enjoying better health and well-being by 2023.\n\nStrengthen governance and policies to make healthy choices accessible and affordable to all, and create sustainable systems that make whole-of-society collaboration real. This approach is based on the rationale that health is determined by multiple factors outside the direct control of the health sector (e.g. education, income, and individual living conditions) and that decisions made in other sectors can affect the health of individuals and shape patterns of disease distribution and mortality.\n\nImproving health literacy in populations provides the foundation on which citizens are enabled to play an active role in improving their own health, engage successfully with community action for health, and push governments to meet their responsibilities in addressing health and health equity.\n\nThe settings approach has roots in the WHO Health for All strategy and, more specifically, the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion. Healthy Settings key principles include community participation, partnership, empowerment and equity. The Healthy Cities programme is the best-known example of a successful Healthy Settings programme.\n\nBringing together all societal and personal influences to raise awareness of and demand for health care, assist in the delivery of resources and services, and cultivate sustainable individual and community involvement.\n\n\n\nNews\n\nWorldwide rally for maternal and newborn health marks World Health Day 2025\n\nWHO and Italian National Institute of Health sign memorandum of understanding to improve care for healthy ageing\n\nAwards for outstanding contributions to public health presented during the Seventy-seventh World Health Assembly\n\nNew report maps efforts to improve \r\nadolescent health and well-being\n\nLatest publications\n\nAntimicrobial resistance prevention and education in schools: a brief for education policy-makers and...\n\nAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a threat to global health, food security and achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The term was formerly used to refer to the field of sociology, the original \"science of society\", established in the 18th century. In addition to sociology, it now encompasses a wide array of academic disciplines, including anthropology, archaeology, economics, geography, history, linguistics, management, communication studies, psychology, culturology and political science.[1]\nPositivist social scientists use methods resembling those used in the natural sciences as tools for understanding societies, and so define science in its stricter modern sense. Interpretivist or speculative social scientists, by contrast, may use social critique or symbolic interpretation rather than constructing empirically falsifiable theories, and thus treat science in its broader sense.[2] In modern academic practice, researchers are often eclectic, using multiple methodologies (for instance, by combining both quantitative and qualitative research).[3] The term social research has also acquired a degree of autonomy as practitioners from various disciplines share similar goals and methods.[4]\nHistory[edit]\nMain article: History of the social sciences\nThe history of the social sciences began in the Age of Enlightenment after 1651,[5] which saw a revolution within natural philosophy, changing the basic framework by which individuals understood what was scientific. Social sciences came forth from the moral philosophy of the time and were influenced by the Age of Revolutions, such as the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution.[6] The social sciences developed from the sciences (experimental and applied), or the systematic knowledge-bases or prescriptive practices, relating to the social improvement of a group of interacting entities.[7][8]\nThe beginnings of the social sciences in the 18th century are reflected in the grand encyclopedia of Diderot, with articles from Jean-Jacques Rousseau and other pioneers. The growth of the social sciences is also reflected in other specialized encyclopedias. The term \"social science\" was coined in French by Mirabeau in 1767, before becoming a distinct conceptual field in the nineteenth century.[9] Social science was influenced by positivism,[6] focusing on knowledge based on actual positive sense experience and avoiding the negative; metaphysical speculation was avoided. Auguste Comte used the term science sociale to describe the field, taken from the ideas of Charles Fourier; Comte also referred to the field as social physics.[6][10]\nFollowing this period, five paths of development sprang forth in the social sciences, influenced by Comte in other fields.[6] One route that was taken was the rise of social research. Large statistical surveys were undertaken in various parts of the United States and Europe. Another route undertaken was initiated by Émile Durkheim, studying \"social facts\", and Vilfredo Pareto, opening metatheoretical ideas and individual theories. A third means developed, arising from the methodological dichotomy present, in which social phenomena were identified with and understood; this was championed by figures such as Max Weber.[11] The fourth route taken, based in economics, was developed and furthered economic knowledge as a hard science. The last path was the correlation of knowledge and social values; the antipositivism and verstehen sociology of Max Weber firmly demanded this distinction. In this route, theory (description) and prescription were non-overlapping formal discussions of a subject.[12][13]\nThe foundation of social sciences in the West implies conditioned relationships between progressive and traditional spheres of knowledge. In some contexts, such as the Italian one, sociology slowly affirms itself and experiences the difficulty of affirming a strategic knowledge beyond philosophy and theology.[14]\nAround the start of the 20th century, Enlightenment philosophy was challenged in various quarters. After the use of classical theories since the end of the scientific revolution, various fields substituted mathematics studies for experimental studies and examining equations to build a theoretical structure. The development of social science subfields became very quantitative in methodology. The interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary nature of scientific inquiry into human behaviour, social and environmental factors affecting it, made many of the natural sciences interested in some aspects of social science methodology.[15] Examples of boundary blurring include emerging disciplines like social research of medicine, sociobiology, neuropsychology, bioeconomics and the history and sociology of science. Increasingly, quantitative research and qualitative methods are being integrated in the study of human action and its implications and consequences. In the first half of the 20th century, statistics became a free-standing discipline of applied mathematics.[16] Statistical methods were used confidently.\nIn the contemporary period, Karl Popper and Talcott Parsons influenced the furtherance of the social sciences.[6] Researchers continue to search for a unified consensus on what methodology might have the power and refinement to connect a proposed \"grand theory\" with the various midrange theories that, with considerable success, continue to provide usable frameworks for massive, growing data banks; for more, see consilience. The social sciences will for the foreseeable future be composed of different zones in the research of, and sometimes distinct in approach toward, the field.[6]\nThe term \"social science\" may refer either to the specific sciences of society established by thinkers such as Comte, Durkheim, Marx, and Weber, or more generally to all disciplines outside of \"noble science\" and arts. By the late 19th century, the academic social sciences were constituted of five fields: jurisprudence and amendment of the law, education, health, economy and trade, and art.[7]\nAround the start of the 21st century, the expanding domain of economics in the social sciences has been described as economic imperialism.[17]\nA distinction is usually drawn between the social sciences and the humanities. Classicist Allan Bloom writes in The Closing of the American Mind (1987):\nSocial science and humanities have a mutual contempt for one another, the former looking down on the latter as unscientific, the latter regarding the former as philistine. […] The difference comes down to the fact that social science really wants to be predictive, meaning that man is predictable, while the humanities say that he is not.[18]\nBranches[edit]\nFor a topical guide, see Outline of social science § Branches of social science.\nThe social science disciplines are branches of knowledge taught and researched at the college or university level. Social science disciplines are defined and recognized by the academic journals in which research is published, and the learned social science societies and academic departments or faculties to which their practitioners belong.",

Framing can manifest in thought or interpersonal communication. Frames in thought consist of the mental representations, interpretations, and simplifications of reality. Frames in communication consist of the communication of frames between different actors.[1] Framing is a key component of sociology, the study of social interaction among humans. Framing is an integral part of conveying and processing data daily. Successful framing techniques can be used to reduce the ambiguity of intangible topics by contextualizing the information in such a way that recipients can connect to what they already know. Framing is mistaken in the world outside of communication as bias, or arguments around nature vs nurture. While biases and how a person is raised might add to stereotypes or anecdotes gathered, those are just possible cultural and biological influences within the set of concepts that is framing.[2]\n\nIn social theory, framing is a schema of interpretation, a collection of anecdotes and stereotypes, that individuals rely on to understand and respond to events.[3] In other words, people build a series of mental \"filters\" through biological and cultural influences. They then use these filters to make sense of the world. The choices they then make are influenced by their creation of a frame. Framing involves social construction of a social phenomenon – by mass media sources, political or social movements, political leaders, or other actors and organizations. Participation in a language community necessarily influences an individual's perception of the meanings attributed to words or phrases. Politically, the language communities of advertising, religion, and mass media are highly contested, whereas framing in less-sharply defended language communities might evolve[citation needed] imperceptibly and organically over cultural time frames, with fewer overt modes of disputation.\n\nOne can view framing in communication as positive or negative – depending on the audience and what kind of information is being presented. The framing may be in the form of equivalence frames, where two or more logically equivalent alternatives are portrayed in different ways (see framing effect) or emphasis frames, which simplify reality by focusing on a subset of relevant aspects of a situation or issue.[1] In the case of \"equivalence frames\", the information being presented is based on the same facts, but the \"frame\" in which it is presented changes, thus creating a reference-dependent perception.\n\nThe effects of framing can be seen in journalism: the frame surrounding the issue can change the reader's perception without having to alter the actual facts as the same information is used as a base. This is done through the media's choice of certain words and images to cover a story (e.g. using the word fetus vs. the word baby).[4] In the context of politics or mass-media communication, a frame defines the packaging of an element of rhetoric in such a way as to encourage certain interpretations and to discourage others. For political purposes, framing often presents facts in such a way that implicates a problem that requires a solution. Members of political parties attempt to frame issues in a way that makes a solution favoring their own political leaning appear as the most appropriate course of action for the situation at hand.[5]\n\nExamples\n\nWhen we want to explain an event, our understanding is often based on our interpretation (frame). If someone rapidly closes and opens an eye, we react differently based on if we interpret this as a \"physical frame\" (they blinked) or a \"social frame\" (they winked). The blink may be due to a speck of dust (resulting in an involuntary and not particularly meaningful reaction). The wink may imply a voluntary and meaningful action (to convey humor to an accomplice, for example).\n\nObservers will read events seen as purely physical or within a frame of \"nature\" differently from those seen as occurring with social frames. But we do not look at an event and then \"apply\" a frame to it. Rather, individuals constantly project into the world around them the interpretive frames that allow them to make sense of it; we only shift frames (or realize that we have habitually applied a frame) when incongruity calls for a frame-shift. In other words, we only become aware of the frames that we always already use when something forces us to replace one frame with another.[6][7]\n\nThough some consider framing to be synonymous with agenda setting, other scholars state that there is a distinction. According to an article written by Donald H. Weaver, framing selects certain aspects of an issue and makes them more prominent in order to elicit certain interpretations and evaluations of the issue, whereas agenda setting introduces the issue topic to increase its salience and accessibility.[8]\n\nIn communication research\n\nNews framing\n\nIn communication, framing defines how news media coverage shapes mass opinion. Richard E. Vatz's discourse on the creation of rhetorical meaning relates directly to framing, although he references it little. To be specific, framing effects refer to behavioral or attitudinal strategies and/or outcomes that are due to how a given piece of information is being framed in public discourse. Today, many volumes of the major communication journals contain papers on media frames and framing effects.[9] Approaches used in such papers can be broadly classified into two groups: studies of framing as the dependent variable and studies of framing as the independent variable.[10] The former usually deals with frame building (i.e. how frames create societal discourse about an issue and how different frames are adopted by journalists) and latter concerns frame setting (i.e. how media framing influences an audience).\n\nFrame building\n\nFrame-building research has typically recognized at least three main sets of influences that may impact the way journalists frame a certain issue:\n\nErving Goffman emphasized the role of cultural context as a shaper of frames when he posited that the meaning of a frame has implicit cultural roots.[3] This context dependency of media frames has been described as 'cultural resonance'[12] or 'narrative fidelity'.[13] As an example, most people might not notice the frame in stories about the separation of church and state, because the media generally does not frame their stories from a religious point of view.[4] Frame building is a process that influences the creation or changes of frames applied by journalists. The term frame building, borrowed from agenda-setting research, seems to capture these processes best.[14]\n\nFrame setting\n\nWhen people are exposed to a novel news frame, they will accept the constructs made applicable to an issue, but they are significantly more likely to do so when they have existing mindset for those settings. This is called the applicability effect. That is, when new frames invite people to apply their existing schema to an issue, the implication of that application depends, in part, on what is in that schema. Therefore, generally, the more the audiences know about issues, the more effective are frames. For example, the more an audience knows about the deceitful practices of the tobacco industry, the more effective is the frame of the tobacco industry, rather than individuals who smoke, being responsible for the health impacts of smoking.[15]\n\nThere are a number of levels and types of framing effects that have been examined.",

Usually included within the social sciences are cultural (or social) anthropology, sociology, psychology, political science, and economics. The discipline of historiography is regarded by many as a social science, and certain areas of historical study are almost indistinguishable from work done in the social sciences. Most historians, however, consider history as one of the humanities. In the United States, focused programs, such as African-American Studies, Latinx Studies, Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, are, as a rule, also included among the social sciences, as are often Latin American Studies and Middle Eastern Studies, while, for instance, French, German, or Italian Studies are commonly associated with humanities. In the past, Sovietology was always considered a social science discipline, in contrast to Russian Studies.\n\nBeginning in the 1950s, the term behavioral sciences was often applied to the disciplines designated as the social sciences. Those who favoured this term did so in part because these disciplines were thus brought closer to some of the sciences, such as physical anthropology and physiological psychology, which also deal with human behaviour.\n\nStrictly speaking, the social sciences, as distinct and recognized academic disciplines, emerged only on the cusp of the 20th century. But one must go back farther in time for the origins of some of their fundamental ideas and objectives. In the largest sense, the origins go all the way back to the ancient Greeks and their rationalist inquiries into human nature, the state, and morality. The heritage of both Greece and Rome is a powerful one in the history of social thought, as it is in other areas of Western society. Very probably, apart from the initial Greek determination to study all things in the spirit of dispassionate and rational inquiry, there would be no social sciences today. True, there have been long periods of time, as during the Western Middle Ages, when the Greek rationalist temper was lacking. But the recovery of this temper, through texts of the great classical philosophers, is the very essence of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment in modern European history. With the Enlightenment, in the 17th and 18th centuries, one may begin.\n\nHeritage of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance\n\nEffects of theology\n\nThe same impulses that led people in that age to explore Earth, the stellar regions, and the nature of matter led them also to explore the institutions around them: state, economy, religion, morality, and, above all, human nature itself. It was the fragmentation of medieval philosophy and theory, and, with this, the shattering of the medieval worldview that had lain deep in thought until about the 16th century, that was the immediate basis of the rise of the several strands of specialized social thought that were in time to provide the inspiration for the social sciences.\n\nMedieval theology, especially as it appears in St. Thomas Aquinas’s Summa theologiae (1265/66–1273), contained and fashioned syntheses from ideas about humanity and society—ideas indeed that may be seen to be political, social, economic, anthropological, and geographical in their substance. But it is partly this close relation between medieval theology and ideas of the social sciences that accounts for the different trajectories of the social sciences, on the one hand, and the trajectories of the physical and life sciences, on the other. From the time of the English philosopher Roger Bacon in the 13th century, there were at least some rudiments of physical science that were largely independent of medieval theology and philosophy. Historians of physical science have no difficulty in tracing the continuation of this experimental tradition, primitive and irregular though it was by later standards, throughout the Middle Ages. Side by side with the kinds of experiment made notable by Bacon were impressive changes in technology through the medieval period and then, in striking degree, in the Renaissance. Efforts to improve agricultural productivity; the rising utilization of gunpowder, with consequent development of guns and the problems that they presented in ballistics; growing trade, leading to increased use of ships and improvements in the arts of navigation, including use of telescopes; and the whole range of such mechanical arts in the Middle Ages and Renaissance as architecture, engineering, optics, and the construction of watches and clocks—all of this put a high premium on a pragmatic and operational understanding of at least the simpler principles of mechanics, physics, astronomy, and, in time, chemistry.\n\nIn short, by the time of Copernicus and Galileo in the 16th century, a fairly broad substratum of physical science existed, largely empirical but not without theoretical implications on which the edifice of modern physical science could be built. It is notable that the empirical foundations of physiology were being established in the studies of the human body being conducted in medieval schools of medicine and, as the career of Leonardo da Vinci so resplendently illustrates, among artists of the Renaissance, whose interest in accuracy and detail of painting and sculpture led to their careful studies of human anatomy.\n\nVery different was the beginning of the social sciences. In the first place, the Roman Catholic Church, throughout the Middle Ages and even into the Renaissance and Reformation, was much more attentive to what scholars wrote and thought about the human mind and human behaviour in society than it was toward what was being studied and written in the physical sciences. From the church’s point of view, while it might be important to see to it that thought on the physical world corresponded as far as possible to what Scripture said—witnessed, for example, in the famous questioning of Galileo—it was far more important that such correspondence exist in matters affecting the human mind, spirit, and soul. Nearly all the subjects and questions that would form the bases of the social sciences in later centuries were tightly woven into the fabric of medieval Scholasticism, and it was not easy for even the boldest minds to break this fabric.",

      "raw_content": "Contents\n\nSequence analysis in social sciences\n\nIn social sciences, sequence analysis (SA) is concerned with the analysis of sets of categorical sequences that typically describe longitudinal data. Analyzed sequences are encoded representations of, for example, individual life trajectories such as family formation, school to work transitions, working careers, but they may also describe daily or weekly time use or represent the evolution of observed or self-reported health, of political behaviors, or the development stages of organizations. Such sequences are chronologically ordered unlike words or DNA sequences for example.\n\nSA is a longitudinal analysis approach that is holistic in the sense that it considers each sequence as a whole. SA is essentially exploratory. Broadly, SA provides a comprehensible overall picture of sets of sequences with the objective of characterizing the structure of the set of sequences, finding the salient characteristics of groups, identifying typical paths, comparing groups, and more generally studying how the sequences are related to covariates such as sex, birth cohort, or social origin.\n\nIntroduced in the social sciences in the 80s by Andrew Abbott,[1][2] SA has gained much popularity after the release of dedicated software such as the SQ[3] and SADI[4] addons for Stata and the TraMineR R package[5] with its companions TraMineRextras[6] and WeightedCluster.[7]\n\nDespite some connections, the aims and methods of SA in social sciences strongly differ from those of sequence analysis in bioinformatics.\n\nHistory\n\nSequence analysis methods were first imported into the social sciences from the information and biological sciences (see Sequence alignment) by the University of Chicago sociologist Andrew Abbott in the 1980s, and they have since developed in ways that are unique to the social sciences.[8] Scholars in psychology, economics, anthropology, demography, communication, political science, learning sciences, organizational studies, and especially sociology have been using sequence methods ever since.\n\nIn sociology, sequence techniques are most commonly employed in studies of patterns of life-course development, cycles, and life histories.[9][10][11][12] There has been a great deal of work on the sequential development of careers,[13][14][15] and there is increasing interest in how career trajectories intertwine with life-course sequences.[16][17] Many scholars have used sequence techniques to model how work and family activities are linked in household divisions of labor and the problem of schedule synchronization within families.[18][19][20] The study of interaction patterns is increasingly centered on sequential concepts, such as turn-taking, the predominance of reciprocal utterances, and the strategic solicitation of preferred types of responses (see Conversation Analysis). Social network analysts (see Social network analysis) have begun to turn to sequence methods and concepts to understand how social contacts and activities are enacted in real time,[21][22] and to model and depict how whole networks evolve.[23] Social network epidemiologists have begun to examine social contact sequencing to better understand the spread of disease.[24] Psychologists have used those methods to study how the order of information affects learning, and to identify structure in interactions between individuals (see Sequence learning).\n\nMany of the methodological developments in sequence analysis came on the heels of a special section devoted to the topic in a 2000 issue[10] of Sociological Methods & Research, which hosted a debate over the use of the optimal matching (OM) edit distance for comparing sequences. In particular, sociologists objected to the descriptive and data-reducing orientation of optimal matching, as well as to a lack of fit between bioinformatic sequence methods and uniquely social phenomena.[25][26] The debate has given rise to several methodological innovations (see Pairwise dissimilarities below) that address limitations of early sequence comparison methods developed in the 20th century. In 2006, David Stark and Balazs Vedres[23] proposed the term \"social sequence analysis\" to distinguish the approach from bioinformatic sequence analysis. However, if we except the nice book by Benjamin Cornwell,[27] the term was seldom used, probably because the context prevents any confusion in the SA literature. Sociological Methods & Research organized a special issue on sequence analysis in 2010, leading to what Aisenbrey and Fasang[28] referred to as the \"second wave of sequence analysis\", which mainly extended optimal matching and introduced other techniques to compare sequences. Alongside sequence comparison, recent advances in SA concerned among others the visualization of sets of sequence data,[5][29] the measure and analysis of the discrepancy of sequences,[30] the identification of representative sequences,[31] and the development of summary indicators of individual sequences.[32] Raab and Struffolino[33] have conceived more recent advances as the third wave of sequence analysis. This wave is largely characterized by the effort of bringing together the stochastic and the algorithmic modeling culture[34] by jointly applying SA with more established methods such as analysis of variance, event history analysis, Markovian modeling, social network analysis, or causal analysis and statistical modeling in general.[35][36][37][27][30][38][39]\n\nDomain-specific theoretical foundation\n\nSociology\n\nThe analysis of sequence patterns has foundations in sociological theories that emerged in the middle of the 20th century.[27]  Structural theorists argued that society is a system that is characterized by regular patterns. Even seemingly trivial social phenomena are ordered in highly predictable ways.[40] This idea serves as an implicit motivation behind social sequence analysts' use of optimal matching, clustering, and related methods to identify common \"classes\" of sequences at all levels of social organization, a form of pattern search. This focus on regularized patterns of social action has become an increasingly influential framework for understanding microsocial interaction and contact sequences, or \"microsequences.\"[41] This is closely related to Anthony Giddens's theory of structuration, which holds that social actors' behaviors are predominantly structured by routines, and which in turn provides predictability and a sense of stability in an otherwise chaotic and rapidly moving social world.[42] This idea is also echoed in Pierre Bourdieu's concept of habitus, which emphasizes the emergence and influence of stable worldviews in guiding everyday action and thus produce predictable, orderly sequences of behavior.[43] The resulting influence of routine as a structuring influence on social phenomena was first illustrated empirically by Pitirim Sorokin, who led a 1939 study that found that daily life is so routinized that a given person is able to predict with about 75% accuracy how much time they will spend doing certain things the following day.[44] Talcott Parsons's argument[40] that all social actors are mutually oriented to their larger social systems (for example, their family and larger community) through social roles also underlies social sequence analysts' interest in the linkages that exist between different social actors' schedules and ordered experiences, which has given rise to a considerable body of work on synchronization between social actors and their social contacts and larger communities.[19][18][45] All of these theoretical orientations together warrant critiques of the general linear model of social reality, which as applied in most work implies that society is either static or that it is highly stochastic in a manner that conforms to Markov processes[1][46] This concern inspired the initial framing of social sequence analysis as an antidote to general linear models.",

She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest.\n\nInvestopedia / Mira Norian\n\nWhat Is Social Science?\n\nSocial science is the study of how people interact with one another. The branches of social science include anthropology, economics, political science, psychology, and sociology.\n\nSocial scientists study how societies work, exploring everything from the triggers of economic growth and the causes of unemployment to what makes people happy. Their findings inform public policies, education programs, urban design, marketing strategies, and many other endeavors.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nUnderstanding Social Science\n\nSocial science as a field of study is separate from the natural sciences, which covers topics such as physics, biology, and chemistry.\n\nSocial science examines the relationships between individuals and societies as well as the development and operation of societies, rather than focusing on the physical world. The academic disciplines involved in the social sciences rely more heavily on interpretation and qualitative research methodologies than do the natural sciences.\n\nImportant\n\nThere are many fields within social science. The five main ones are anthropology, economics, political science, psychology, and sociology, although some people also include history, criminology, and geography.\n\nBranches of Social Science\n\nOpinions vary on which branches of study are included under social science. However, most observers agree that the following five fields fall into the category:\n\nHistory is also sometimes regarded as a branch of social science, although many historians often consider the subject to share closer links to the humanities. Both humanities and social science study human beings. What separates them is the technique applied: Humanities are viewed as more philosophical and less scientific. Law, too, has some ties to social science, as does geography.\n\nAnthropology\n\nAnthropology, the study of the origin and development of human societies and cultures, has been a focal point for centuries. The field gained importance in Europe's Age of Enlightenment, which flourished in the 17th and 18th centuries. During that period, there was a pronounced focus on advancing society and knowledge, and understanding human behavior was seen as a key to achieving that goal.\n\nEconomics\n\nThe history of economic thought goes back all the way to ancient Greek philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, and Xenophon. Their works laid the foundation of nearly all social science, economics included.\n\nAs travel became easier in the 15th to 18th centuries, and more nations were able to partake in international trade, the economic system of mercantilism grew. The economic actions of many nations were suddenly motivated by the belief that a country should maximize exports and minimize imports.\n\nThis predominating school of thought was challenged by writers such as Adam Smith, commonly known as the father of modern economics. Smith’s ideas, along with those of Rousseau and John Locke, promoted the idea of a self-regulating economy and introduced the concept of what is known as classical economics. Smith’s book The Wealth of Nations is still studied today and admired by many politicians.\n\nTwo other important economists who have shaped the way we think of economics are Karl Marx and John Maynard Keynes. Marx famously challenged capitalism as an appropriate economic model by placing an emphasis on the labor theory of value. While Marx’s ideas are by no means widely endorsed by most of today’s politicians, his critique of capitalism has had a huge impact on many thinkers.\n\nThe Keynesian school of economics, meanwhile, is very popular among today’s economists. Keynesian economics is considered a demand-side macroeconomic theory that focuses on changes in the economy over the short run. It was the first to separate the study of economic behavior and markets based on individual incentives from the study of broad national economic aggregate variables and constructs.\n\nPolitical Science\n\nThe origins of political science can be traced back to ancient Greece. Back then, the philosopher Plato wrote various dialogues about politics, justice, and what constitutes good government.\n\nPlato’s early contributions would gradually take on a more scientific approach, led by thinkers including Aristotle, Thomas Hobbes, Marx, and Max Weber. Centuries of research into politics helped to boost democracy and assist politicians in making popular policy choices and get voted into power.\n\nPsychology\n\nPsychology is one of the fastest growing fields of social science. It began as a medical field of study in the late 1800s and grew popular in the Western world throughout the 20th century, thanks in part to the work of Sigmund Freud.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 20.3% of adults had received some form of mental health treatment in 2020. Although many still use psychiatric medicine to treat their mental health issues, more people in recent years are seeking alternative treatments, such as mindfulness training and yoga in addition to traditional talk therapy.\n\nNeuroscience, drug treatments, and a growing variety of approaches to psychotherapy are adding to the options for psychological treatment. Research on animal learning, social psychology, and economic psychology are other branches of the field.\n\nSociology\n\nSociology as a science developed in Europe in the mid-1800s, a period of rapid social change. Political revolutions and the Industrial Revolution drastically altered how many people lived, which wasn't always for the better. This prompted early sociologists to wonder how to maintain stability when so much in life was shifting so fast.\n\nThe first sociology course in the U.S. was taught at Yale University by 1875. In the years that followed, other colleges added sociology to the curriculum and the subject arrived in high schools in 1911.\n\nSocial Science in Schools\n\nIn the United States, education in the social sciences begins in elementary school and progresses throughout middle and high school. There is an emphasis on aspects of core social sciences such as economics and political science. At the collegiate level, more specialized disciplines are offered.\n\nNowadays, colleges and universities offer numerous social science programs. For example, the University of California, Berkeley has 15 academic departments categorized as social sciences. They are:\n\nMaster’s degree and Ph.D. programs at colleges and universities offer opportunities for deeper specialization.\n\nFast Fact\n\nEconomists and social workers are among the most sought-after employees in the U.S., according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).\n\nSocial Science Careers\n\nTypical careers in social science include working as an advertiser, psychologist, teacher, lawyer, manager, social worker, and economist.\n\nThe subject matter of social science—human behavior, relationships, attitudes, and how these things have changed over time—is useful information for any successful business to possess. The concepts of social science, such as demography, political science, and sociology, are frequently applied in many different business contexts.\n\nFor example, advertising and marketing professionals often use theories of human behavior from these fields to more efficiently market their products to consumers.\n\nEconomists and Social Workers\n\nNaturally, the field of economics is key to the business sector. Many industries use economic analysis and quantitative methods to study and forecast business, sales, and other market trends.\n\nIn fact, economists are some of the most sought-after workers in the U.S.",

      "raw_content": "Sociology\n\nOur editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article.\n\nSociology came into being in precisely these terms, and during much of the century it was not easy to distinguish between a great deal of so-called sociology and social or cultural anthropology. Even if almost no sociologists in the century made empirical studies of indigenous peoples, as did the anthropologists, their interest in the origin, development, and probable future of humankind was not less great than what could be found in the writings of the anthropologists. It was Comte who applied to the science of humanity the word sociology, and he used it to refer to what he imagined would be a single, all-encompassing, science that would take its place at the top of the hierarchy of sciences—a hierarchy that Comte saw as including astronomy (the oldest of the sciences historically) at the bottom and with physics, chemistry, and biology rising in that order to sociology, the latest and grandest of the sciences. There was no thought in Comte’s mind—nor was there in the mind of Spencer, whose general view of sociology was very much like Comte’s—of there being other competing social sciences. Sociology would be to the whole of the social, i.e., human, world what each of the other great sciences was to its appropriate sphere of reality.\n\nBoth Comte and Spencer believed that civilization as a whole was the proper subject of sociology. Their works were concerned, for the most part, with describing the origins and development of civilization and also of each of its major institutions. Both declared sociology’s main divisions to be “statics” and “dynamics,” the former concerned with processes of order in human life (equated with society), the latter with processes of evolutionary change. Both thinkers also saw all existing societies in the world as reflective of the successive stages through which Western society had advanced in time over a period of tens of thousands of years.\n\nNot all thinkers in the 19th century, who would be considered sociologists today, shared this approach, however. Side by side with the “grand” view represented by Comte and Spencer were those in the century who were primarily interested in the social problems that they saw around them—consequences, as they interpreted them, of the two revolutions, the industrial and democratic. Thus, in France just after mid-century, Le Play published a monumental study of the social aspects of the working classes in Europe, Les Ouvriers européens (1855; “European Workers”), which compared families and communities in all parts of Europe and even other parts of the world. Tocqueville, especially in the second volume of Democracy in America, provided an account of the customs, social structures, and institutions in America, dealing with these—and also with the social and psychological problems of Americans in that day—as aspects of the impact of the democratic and industrial revolutions upon traditional society.\n\nAt the very end of the 19th century, in both France and Germany, there appeared some of the works in sociology that were to prove more influential in their effects upon the actual academic discipline in the 20th century. Tönnies, in his Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft (1887; translated as Community and Society), sought to explain all major social problems in the West as the consequence of the West’s historical transition from the communal, status-based, concentric society of the Middle Ages to the more individualistic, impersonal, and large-scale society of the democratic-industrial period. In general terms, allowing for individual variations of theme, these are considered the views of Weber, Simmel, and Durkheim (all of whom also wrote in the late 19th and early 20th century). These were the figures who, starting from the problems of Western society that could be traced to the effects of the two revolutions, did the most to establish the discipline of sociology as it was practiced for much of the 20th century.\n\nSocial psychology\n\nSocial psychology as a distinct trend of thought also originated in the 19th century, although its outlines were perhaps somewhat less clear than was true of the other social sciences. The close relation of the human mind to the social order, its dependence upon education and other forms of socialization, was well known in the 18th century. In the 19th century, however, an ever more systematic thinking came into being to uncover the social and cultural roots of human psychology and also the several types of “collective mind” that analysis of different cultures and societies in the world might reveal. In Germany, Moritz Lazarus and Wilhelm Wundt sought to fuse the study of psychological phenomena with analyses of whole cultures. Folk psychology, as it was called, did not, however, last very long.\n\nMuch more esteemed were the works of such thinkers as Gabriel Tarde, Gustave Le Bon, Lucien Lévy-Bruhl, and Durkheim in France and Simmel in Germany (all of whom also wrote in the early 20th century). Here, in concrete, often highly empirical studies of small groups, associations, crowds, and other aggregates (rather than in the main line of psychology during the century, which tended to be sheer philosophy at one extreme and a variant of physiology at the other) are to be found the real beginnings of social psychology. Although the point of departure in each of the studies was the nature of association, they dealt, in one degree or another, with the internal processes of psychosocial interaction, the operation of attitudes and judgments, and the social basis of personality and thought—in short, with those phenomena that would, at least in the 20th century, be the substance of social psychology as a formal discipline.\n\nSocial statistics and social geography\n\nTwo final 19th-century trends to become integrated into the social sciences in the 20th century are social statistics and social (or human) geography. At that time, neither achieved the notability and acceptance in colleges and universities that such fields as political science and economics did. Both, however, were as clearly visible by the latter part of the century and both were to exert a great deal of influence on the other social sciences by the beginning of the 20th century: social statistics on sociology and social psychology preeminently; social geography on political science, economics, history, and certain areas of anthropology, especially those areas dealing with the dispersion of races and the diffusion of cultural elements. In social statistics the key figure of the century was Quetelet, who was the first, on any systematic basis, to call attention to the kinds of structured behaviour that could be observed and identified only through statistical means. It was he who brought into prominence the momentous concept of “the average man” and his behaviour. The two major figures in social or human geography in the century were Friedrich Ratzel in Germany and Paul Vidal de La Blache in France. Both broke completely with the crude environmentalism of earlier centuries, which had sought to show how topography and climate actually determine human behaviour, and they substituted the more subtle and sophisticated insights into the relationships of land, sea, and climate on the one hand and, on the other, the varied types of culture and human association that are to be found on Earth.\n\nSocial science from the turn of the 20th century\n\nScience and social science\n\nIt is impossible to understand, much less to assess, the social sciences without first understanding what, in general, science is. The word itself conveys little. As late as the 18th century, science was used as a near-synonym of art, both meaning any kind of knowledge—though the sciences and the arts could perhaps be distinguished by the former’s greater abstraction from reality.",

      "raw_content": "History of the separate disciplines\n\nOur editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article.\n\nAmong the disciplines that formed the social sciences, two contrary, for a time equally powerful, tendencies at first dominated them. The first was the drive toward unification, toward a single, master social science, whatever it might be called. The second tendency was toward specialization of the individual social sciences. If, clearly, it is the second that has triumphed, with the results to be seen in the disparate, sometimes jealous, highly specialized disciplines seen today, the first was not without great importance and must also be examined.\n\nWhat emerges from the critical rationalism of the 18th century is not, in the first instance, a conception of need for a plurality of social sciences, but rather for a single science of humanity that would take its place in the hierarchy of the sciences that included the fields of astronomy, physics, chemistry, and biology. In the 1840s, Comte called for a new science, one with humanity, not humans as animals, as its subject (humans as animals already being a subject of biology). Although he conceived of society as the distinguishing characteristic of humanity, he assuredly had but a single encompassing science in mind—not a congeries of disciplines, each concerned with some single aspect of human behaviour in society. The same was true of Bentham, Marx, and Spencer. All of these thinkers, and there were many others to join them, saw the study of society as a unified enterprise. They would have scoffed, and on occasion did, at any notion of a separate economics, political science, sociology, and so on. Humanity is an indivisible thing, they would have argued; so, too, must be the study of society, its distinguishing characteristic.\n\nIt was, however, the opposite tendency of specialization or differentiation that won out. No matter how the century began, or what were the dreams of a Comte, Spencer, or Marx, when the 19th century ended, not one but several distinct, competitive social sciences were to be found. Aiding this process was the development of the colleges and universities. The growing desire for an elective system, for a substantial number of academic specializations, and for differentiation of academic degrees contributed strongly to the differentiation of the social sciences. This was first and most strongly to be seen in Germany, where, from about 1815 on, all scholarship and science were based in the universities and where competition for status among the several disciplines was keen. But by the end of the century the same phenomenon of specialization was to be found in the United States (where admiration for the German system was very great in academic circles) and, in somewhat less degree, in France and England. On the face of it, the differentiation of the social sciences in the 19th century was but one aspect of a larger process that was to be seen vividly in the physical sciences and the humanities. No major field escaped the lure of specialization of investigation, and clearly, a great deal of the sheer bulk of learning that passed from the 19th to the 20th century was the direct consequence of this specialization. But the reasons behind specialization in the social sciences, the category that earlier did not exist, were different.\n\nEconomics\n\nIt was economics that first attained the status of an exclusive area of speculation and study among the social sciences. The huge volumes on administration, with their extensive lexicons, written by German cameralists, and that autonomy and self-regulation that the physiocrats and Smith (especially as interpreted by German academics) had found, or thought they had found, in the processes of wealth, in the operation of prices, rents, interest, and wages, during the 18th century became the basis of a separate and distinctive trend of thought, called “political economy,” in the 19th. Hence the emphasis upon what came to be widely called laissez-faire. If, as it was argued, the processes of wealth operate naturally in terms of their own built-in mechanisms, then not only should these be studied separately but they should, in any wise polity, be left alone by government and society. This was, in general, the overriding emphasis of such thinkers as Ricardo, Mill, and Nassau William Senior in England, of Frédéric Bastiat and Say in France, and, somewhat later, the Austrian school of Carl Menger. This emphasis is today called “classical” in economics, and it is even now, though with substantial modifications, a strong position in the field.\n\nThere were from the beginning, however, thinkers on the subject, including Smith himself, who diverged sharply from this laissez-faire, classical view. In Germany the enormously influential Friedrich List originated the school of “national economy”—which would be today recognized as economic nationalism, opposing international free trade and advocating protectionist measures for domestic economy (a view with which Smith agreed under certain circumstances, the difference between Smith and List being that the former was a pragmatist, while for the latter the position was a matter of principle). There were also the so-called historical economists, proceeding from the presuppositions of social evolution, referred to above. Such figures as Wilhelm Roscher and Karl Knies in Germany tended to dismiss the assumptions of timelessness and universality regarding economic behaviour that were axiomatic among the German followers of Smith, and they strongly insisted upon the developmental character of capitalism, evolving in a long series of stages from other types of economy.\n\nAlso prominent throughout the century were those who came to be called the socialists. They too repudiated any notion of timelessness and universality in capitalism and its elements of private property, competition, and profit. Not only was this system but a passing stage of economic development; it could be—and, as Marx was to emphasize, would be—shortly supplanted by a more humane and also realistic economic system based upon cooperation, the people’s ownership of the means of production, and planning that would eradicate the vices of competition and conflict.\n\nPolitical science\n\nRivalling economic thought in popularity during the century was “political science,” so called long before “science” was appropriated as the proper name for the unbiased exploration of the empirical world. The line of systematic interest in the state that had begun in modern Europe with Niccolò Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau, among others, widened and lengthened in the 19th century, the consequence of the two revolutions. If the Industrial Revolution seemed to supply all the problems frustrating the existence of a stable and humane society, the political-democratic revolution could be seen as containing many of the answers to these problems. It was the democratic revolution, especially in France, that created the vision of a political government responsible for all aspects of human society and, most important, possessed the power to wield this responsibility. This power, known as sovereignty, could be seen as holding the same relation to political science in the 19th century that capital held to economic thought. A very large number of political “scientists” essentially ruminated on the varied properties of sovereignty. There was a strong tendency on the part of such thinkers as Bentham, Austin, and Mill in England and Francis Lieber and Woodrow Wilson in the United States to see the state and its claimed sovereignty over human lives in much the same terms in which classical political economists saw capitalism.\n\nAmong political scientists there was the same historical-evolutionary dissent from this view, however, that existed in political economy.",
