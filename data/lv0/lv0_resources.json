      "raw_content": "The arts\nThe arts or creative arts are a vast range of human practices of creative expression, storytelling, and cultural participation. The arts encompass diverse and plural modes of thinking, doing, and being in an extensive range of media. Both dynamic and a characteristically constant feature of human life have developed into stylized and intricate forms. This is achieved through sustained and deliberate study, training, or theorizing within a particular tradition, generations, and even between civilizations. The arts are a vehicle through which human beings cultivate distinct social, cultural, and individual identities while transmitting values, impressions, judgements, ideas, visions, spiritual meanings, patterns of life, and experiences across time and space.\nProminent examples of the arts include: visual arts (including architecture, ceramics, drawing, filmmaking, painting, photography, and sculpting), literary arts (including fiction, drama, poetry, and prose), and performing arts (including dance, music, and theatre). They can employ skill and imagination to produce objects and performances, convey insights and experiences, and construct new environments and spaces.\nThe arts can refer to common, popular, or everyday practices as well as more sophisticated, systematic, or institutionalized ones. They can be discrete and self-contained or combine and interweave with other art forms, such as combining artwork with the written word in comics. They can also develop or contribute to some particular aspect of a more complex art form, as in cinematography. By definition, the arts themselves are open to being continually redefined. The practice of modern art, for example, is a testament to the shifting boundaries, improvisation and experimentation, reflexive nature, and self-criticism or questioning that art and its conditions of production, reception, and possibility can undergo.\nAs both a means of developing capacities of attention and sensitivity and ends in themselves, the arts can simultaneously be a form of response to the world. It is a way to transform our responses and what we deem worthwhile goals or pursuits. From prehistoric cave paintings to ancient and contemporary forms of ritual to modern-day films, art has served to register, embody, and preserve our ever-shifting relationships with each other and the world.\nDefinition\nThe arts are considered various practices or objects done by people with skill, creativity, and imagination across cultures and history, viewed as a group.[1] These activities include painting, sculpture, music, theatre, literature, and more.[2] Art refers to the way of doing or applying human creative skills, typically in visual form.[3][4]\nHistory and classifications\nIn Ancient Greece, art and craft were referred to by the word techne. Ancient Greek art brought the veneration of the animal form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty, and anatomically correct proportions. Ancient Roman art depicted gods as idealized humans, shown with characteristic distinguishing features, e.g. Zeus' thunderbolt. In Byzantine and Gothic art of the Middle Ages, the dominant church insisted on the expression of Christian themes due to the overlap of church and state.[5] Eastern art has generally worked in style akin to Western medieval art, namely a concentration on surface patterning and local colour (meaning the plain colour of an object, such as basic red for a red robe, rather than the modulations of that colour brought about by light, shade, and reflection). A characteristic of this style is that local colour is defined by an outline (a contemporary equivalent is the cartoon). This is evident, for example, in the art of India, Tibet, and Japan. Islamic art avoids the representation of living beings, particularly humans and other animals, in religious contexts.[6] It instead expresses religious ideas through calligraphy and geometrical designs.[7]\nClassifications\nIn the Middle Ages, liberal arts were taught in European universities as part of the Trivium, an introductory curriculum involving grammar, rhetoric, and logic,[8] and of the Quadrivium, a curriculum involving the \"mathematical arts\" of arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy.[9] In modern academia, the arts can be grouped with, or as a subset of, the humanities.[10]\nThe arts have been classified as seven: painting, architecture, sculpture, literature, music, performing, and cinema.[11] Some view literature, painting, sculpture, and music as the central four arts, of which the others are derivative; drama is literature with acting, dance is music expressed through motion, and song is music with literature and voice.[12][failed verification] Film is sometimes called the \"eighth\" and comics the \"ninth art\" in Francophone scholarship, adding to the traditional \"Seven Arts\".[13][14] Cultural fields like gastronomy are only sometimes considered as arts.[15]\nVisual arts\nArchitecture\nArchitecture is the art and science of designing buildings and structures. A wider definition would include the design of the built environment, from the macro level of urban planning, urban design, and landscape architecture, to the micro level of creating furniture.[16] The word architecture comes from the Latin architectūra, from architectus \"master builder, director of works.\"[16][17] Architectural design usually must address feasibility and cost for the builder, as well as function and aesthetics for the user.[18]\nIn modern usage, architecture is the art and discipline of creating or inferring an implied or apparent plan for a complex object or system.[19] Some types of architecture manipulate space, volume, texture, light, shadow, or abstract elements, to achieve pleasing aesthetics.[20] Architectural works may be seen as cultural and political symbols, or works of art. The role of the architect, though changing, has been central to the design and implementation of pleasingly built environments, in which people live.[21]\nCeramics\nCeramic art is art made from ceramic materials (including clay),[22] which may take forms such as pottery, tile, figurines, sculpture, and tableware. While some ceramic products are considered fine art, others are considered decorative, industrial, or applied art objects. Ceramics may also be considered artefacts in archaeology. Ceramic art can be made by one person or by a group of people. In a pottery or ceramic factory, a group of people design, manufacture, and decorate the pottery. Some pottery is regarded as art pottery.[23] In a one-person pottery studio, ceramists or potters produce studio pottery. Ceramics excludes glass and mosaics made from glass tesserae.[24]\nConceptual art\nConceptual art is art wherein the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in the work take precedence over traditional aesthetic and material concerns.[25] The inception of the term in the 1960s referred to a strict and focused practice of idea-based art that defied traditional visual criteria associated with the visual arts in its presentation as text.[26] Through its association with the Young British Artists and the Turner Prize during the 1990s,[27] its popular usage, particularly in the United Kingdom, developed as a synonym for all contemporary art that does not practice the traditional skills of painting and sculpture.[28]\nDrawing\nDrawing is a means of making an image using any of a wide variety of tools and techniques. It generally involves making marks on a surface by applying pressure from a tool, or moving a tool across a surface. Common tools are graphite pencils, pen and ink, inked brushes, wax coloured pencils, crayons, charcoals, pastels, and markers. Digital tools with similar effects are also used. The main techniques used in drawing are line drawing, hatching, cross-hatching, random hatching, scribbling, stippling, and blending. An artist who excels in drawing is referred to as a drafter, draftswoman, or draughtsman.",

      "raw_content": "Art\nArt describes a diverse range of cultural activity centered around works utilizing creative or imaginative talents, which are expected to evoke a worthwhile experience,[1] generally through an expression of emotional power, conceptual ideas, technical proficiency, and/or beauty.[2][3][4]\nThere is no generally agreed definition of what constitutes art,[5][6][7] and its interpretation has varied greatly throughout history and across cultures. In the Western tradition, the three classical branches of visual art are painting, sculpture, and architecture.[8] Theatre, dance, and other performing arts, as well as literature, music, film and other media such as interactive media, are included in a broader definition of \"the arts\".[2][9] Until the 17th century, art referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from crafts or sciences. In modern usage after the 17th century, where aesthetic considerations are paramount, the fine arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general, such as the decorative or applied arts.\nThe nature of art and related concepts, such as creativity and interpretation, are explored in a branch of philosophy known as aesthetics.[10] The resulting artworks are studied in the professional fields of art criticism and the history of art.\nOverview\nIn the perspective of the history of art,[11] artistic works have existed for almost as long as humankind: from early prehistoric art to contemporary art; however, some theorists think that the typical concept of \"artistic works\" does not fit well outside modern Western societies.[12] One early sense of the definition of art is closely related to the older Latin meaning, which roughly translates to \"skill\" or \"craft\", as associated with words such as \"artisan\". English words derived from this meaning include artifact, artificial, artifice, medical arts, and military arts. However, there are many other colloquial uses of the word, all with some relation to its etymology.\nOver time, philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Socrates and Immanuel Kant, among others, questioned the meaning of art.[13] Several dialogues in Plato tackle questions about art, while Socrates says that poetry is inspired by the muses and is not rational. He speaks approvingly of this, and other forms of divine madness (drunkenness, eroticism, and dreaming) in the Phaedrus (265a–c), and yet in the Republic wants to outlaw Homer's great poetic art, and laughter as well. In Ion, Socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of Homer that he expresses in the Republic. The dialogue Ion suggests that Homer's Iliad functioned in the ancient Greek world as the Bible does today in the modern Christian world: as divinely inspired literary art that can provide moral guidance, if only it can be properly interpreted.[14]\nWith regards to the literary art and the musical arts, Aristotle considered epic poetry, tragedy, comedy, Dithyrambic poetry and music to be mimetic or imitative art, each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner.[15] For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation—through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.[16] Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals.[17]\nThe more recent and specific sense of the word art as an abbreviation for creative art or fine art emerged in the early 17th century.[18] Fine art refers to a skill used to express the artist's creativity, or to engage the audience's aesthetic sensibilities, or to draw the audience towards consideration of more refined or finer works of art.\nWithin this latter sense, the word art may refer to several things: (i) a study of a creative skill, (ii) a process of using the creative skill, (iii) a product of the creative skill, or (iv) the audience's experience with the creative skill. The creative arts (art as discipline) are a collection of disciplines which produce artworks (art as objects) that are compelled by a personal drive (art as activity) and convey a message, mood, or symbolism for the perceiver to interpret (art as experience). Art is something that stimulates an individual's thoughts, emotions, beliefs, or ideas through the senses. Works of art can be explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the basis of images or objects. For some scholars, such as Kant, the sciences and the arts could be distinguished by taking science as representing the domain of knowledge and the arts as representing the domain of the freedom of artistic expression.[19]\nOften, if the skill is being used in a common or practical way, people will consider it a craft instead of art. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way, it may be considered commercial art instead of fine art. On the other hand, crafts and design are sometimes considered applied art. Some art followers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference.[20] However, even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression. The purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas, such as in politically, spiritually, or philosophically motivated art; to create a sense of beauty (see aesthetics); to explore the nature of perception; for pleasure; or to generate strong emotions. The purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent.\nThe nature of art has been described by philosopher Richard Wollheim as \"one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture\".[21] Art has been defined as a vehicle for the expression or communication of emotions and ideas, a means for exploring and appreciating formal elements for their own sake, and as mimesis or representation. Art as mimesis has deep roots in the philosophy of Aristotle.[22] Leo Tolstoy identified art as a use of indirect means to communicate from one person to another.[22] Benedetto Croce and R. G. Collingwood advanced the idealist view that art expresses emotions, and that the work of art therefore essentially exists in the mind of the creator.[23][24] The theory of art as form has its roots in the philosophy of Kant, and was developed in the early 20th century by Roger Fry and Clive Bell. More recently, thinkers influenced by Martin Heidegger have interpreted art as the means by which a community develops for itself a medium for self-expression and interpretation.[25] George Dickie has offered an institutional theory of art that defines a work of art as any artifact upon which a qualified person or persons acting on behalf of the social institution commonly referred to as \"the art world\" has conferred \"the status of candidate for appreciation\".[26] Larry Shiner has described fine art as \"not an essence or a fate but something we have made. Art as we have generally understood it is a European invention barely two hundred years old.\"[27]\nArt may be characterized in terms of mimesis (its representation of reality), narrative (storytelling), expression, communication of emotion, or other qualities. During the Romantic period, art came to be seen as \"a special faculty of the human mind to be classified with religion and science\".[28]\nHistory\nA shell engraved by Homo erectus was determined to be between 430,000 and 540,000 years old.[30] A set of eight 130,000 years old white-tailed eagle talons bear cut marks and abrasion that indicate manipulation by neanderthals, possibly for using it as jewelry.[31] A series of tiny, drilled snail shells about 75,000 years old—were discovered in a South African cave.",

      "raw_content": "Visual arts\nThe visual arts are art forms such as painting, drawing, printmaking, sculpture, ceramics, photography, video, image, filmmaking, design, crafts, and architecture. Many artistic disciplines such as performing arts, conceptual art, and textile arts, also involve aspects of the visual arts, as well as arts of other types. Within the visual arts,[1] the applied arts,[2] such as industrial design, graphic design, fashion design, interior design, and decorative art[3] are also included.\nCurrent usage of the term \"visual arts\" includes fine art as well as applied or decorative arts and crafts, but this was not always the case. Before the Arts and Crafts Movement in Britain and elsewhere at the turn of the 20th century, the term 'artist' had for some centuries often been restricted to a person working in the fine arts (such as painting, sculpture, or printmaking) and not the decorative arts, crafts, or applied visual arts media. The distinction was emphasized by artists of the Arts and Crafts Movement, who valued vernacular art forms as much as high forms.[4] Art schools made a distinction between the fine arts and the crafts, maintaining that a craftsperson could not be considered a practitioner of the arts.\nThe increasing tendency to privilege painting, and to a lesser degree sculpture, above other arts has been a feature of Western art as well as East Asian art. In both regions, painting has been seen as relying to the highest degree on the imagination of the artist and being the furthest removed from manual labour – in Chinese painting, the most highly valued styles were those of \"scholar-painting\", at least in theory practiced by gentleman amateurs. The Western hierarchy of genres reflected similar attitudes.\nEducation and training\n[edit]Training in the visual arts has generally been through variations of the apprentice and workshop systems. In Europe, the Renaissance movement to increase the prestige of the artist led to the academy system for training artists, and today most of the people who are pursuing a career in the arts train in art schools at tertiary levels. Visual arts have now become an elective subject in most education systems.[5][6]\nIn East Asia, arts education for nonprofessional artists typically focused on brushwork; calligraphy was numbered among the Six Arts of gentlemen in the Chinese Zhou dynasty, and calligraphy and Chinese painting were numbered among the four arts of scholar-officials in imperial China.[7][8][9]\nLeading country in the development of the arts in Latin America, in 1875 created the National Society of the Stimulus of the Arts, founded by painters Eduardo Schiaffino, Eduardo Sívori, and other artists. Their guild was rechartered as the National Academy of Fine Arts in 1905 and, in 1923, on the initiative of painter and academic Ernesto de la Cárcova, as a department in the University of Buenos Aires, the Superior Art School of the Nation. Currently, the leading educational organization for the arts in the country is the UNA Universidad Nacional de las Artes.[10]\nDrawing\n[edit]Drawing is a means of making an image, illustration or graphic using any of a wide variety of tools and techniques available online and offline. It generally involves making marks on a surface by applying pressure from a tool, or moving a tool across a surface using dry media such as graphite pencils, pen and ink, inked brushes, wax color pencils, crayons, charcoals, pastels, and markers. Digital tools, including pens, stylus, that simulate the effects of these are also used. The main techniques used in drawing are: line drawing, hatching, crosshatching, random hatching, shading, scribbling, stippling, and blending. An artist who excels at drawing is referred to as a draftsman or draughtsman.[11]\nDrawing and painting go back tens of thousands of years. Art of the Upper Paleolithic includes figurative art beginning between about 40,000 to 35,000 years ago. Non-figurative cave paintings consisting of hand stencils and simple geometric shapes are even older. Paleolithic cave representations of animals are found in areas such as Lascaux, France and Altamira, Spain in Europe, Maros, Sulawesi in Asia, and Gabarnmung, Australia.\nIn ancient Egypt, ink drawings on papyrus, often depicting people, were used as models for painting or sculpture. Drawings on Greek vases, initially geometric, later developed into the human form with black-figure pottery during the 7th century BC.[12]\nWith paper becoming common in Europe by the 15th century, drawing was adopted by masters such as Sandro Botticelli, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Leonardo da Vinci, who sometimes treated drawing as an art in its own right rather than a preparatory stage for painting or sculpture.\nPainting\n[edit]Painting taken literally is the practice of applying pigment suspended in a carrier (or medium) and a binding agent (a glue) to a surface (support) such as paper, canvas or a wall. However, when used in an artistic sense it means the use of this activity in combination with drawing, composition, or other aesthetic considerations in order to manifest the expressive and conceptual intention of the practitioner. Painting is also used to express spiritual motifs and ideas; sites of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery to The Sistine Chapel, to the human body itself.[13]\nHistory\n[edit]Origins and early history\n[edit]Like drawing, painting has its documented origins in caves and on rock faces. The finest examples, believed by some to be 32,000 years old, are in the Chauvet and Lascaux caves in southern France. In shades of red, brown, yellow and black, the paintings on the walls and ceilings are of bison, cattle, horses and deer.\nPaintings of human figures can be found in the tombs of ancient Egypt. In the great temple of Ramses II, Nefertari, his queen, is depicted being led by Isis.[14] The Greeks contributed to painting but much of their work has been lost. One of the best remaining representations are the Hellenistic Fayum mummy portraits. Another example is mosaic of the Battle of Issus at Pompeii, which was probably based on a Greek painting. Greek and Roman art contributed to Byzantine art in the 4th century BC, which initiated a tradition in icon painting.[15]\nThe Renaissance\n[edit]Apart from the illuminated manuscripts produced by monks during the Middle Ages, the next significant contribution to European art was from Italy's renaissance painters. From Giotto in the 13th century to Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael at the beginning of the 16th century, this was the richest period in Italian art as the chiaroscuro techniques were used to create the illusion of 3-D space.[16]\nPainters in northern Europe too were influenced by the Italian school. Jan van Eyck from Belgium, Pieter Bruegel the Elder from the Netherlands and Hans Holbein the Younger from Germany are among the most successful painters of the times. They used the glazing technique with oils to achieve depth and luminosity.\nDutch masters\n[edit]The 17th century witnessed the emergence of the great Dutch masters such as the versatile Rembrandt who was especially remembered for his portraits and Bible scenes, and Vermeer who specialized in interior scenes of Dutch life.\nBaroque\n[edit]The Baroque started after the Renaissance, from the late 16th century to the late 17th century. Main artists of the Baroque included Caravaggio, who made heavy use of tenebrism. Peter Paul Rubens, a Flemish painter who studied in Italy, worked for local churches in Antwerp and also painted a series for Marie de' Medici. Annibale Carracci took influences from the Sistine Chapel and created the genre of illusionistic ceiling painting. Much of the development that happened in the Baroque was because of the Protestant Reformation and the resulting Counter Reformation. Much of what defines the Baroque is dramatic lighting and overall visuals.",

They are also more complicated and expensive to set up, but offer more protection and benefits for the owners and members.[6]\nForms\nForms of business ownership vary by jurisdiction, but several common entities exist:\n- A sole proprietorship, also known as a sole trader, is owned by one person and operates for their benefit. The owner operates the business alone and may hire employees. A sole proprietor has unlimited liability for all obligations incurred by the business, whether from operating costs or judgments against the business. All assets of the business belong to a sole proprietor, including, for example, a computer infrastructure, any inventory, manufacturing equipment, or retail fixtures, as well as any real property owned by the sole proprietor.[7]\n- A partnership is a business owned by two or more people. In most forms of partnerships, each partner has unlimited liability for the debts incurred by the business. The three most prevalent types of for-profit partnerships are general partnerships, limited partnerships, and limited liability partnerships.[8]\n- Corporations' owners have limited liability, and the business has a legal personality separate from its owners. Corporations can be either government-owned or privately owned, and they can organize either for profit or as nonprofit organizations. A privately owned, for-profit corporation is owned by its shareholders, who elect a board of directors to direct the corporation and hire its managerial staff. A privately owned, for-profit corporation can be either privately held by a small group of individuals, or publicly held, with publicly traded shares listed on a stock exchange.[9]\n- A cooperative or co-op is a limited-liability business that can organize as for-profit or not-for-profit. A cooperative differs from a corporation in that it has members, not shareholders, and they share decision-making authority. Cooperatives are typically classified as either consumer cooperatives or worker cooperatives. Cooperatives are fundamental to the ideology of economic democracy.\n- Limited liability companies (LLC) and other specific types of business organization protect their owners or shareholders from business failure by doing business under a separate legal entity with certain legal protections. In contrast, a general partnership or persons working on their own are usually not as protected.[10]\n- A franchise is a system in which entrepreneurs purchase the rights to open and run a business from a larger corporation.[11] Franchising in the United States is widespread and is a major economic powerhouse. One out of twelve retail businesses in the United States are franchised and 8 million people are employed in a franchised business.[12]\n- Company limited by guarantee is commonly used where companies are formed for non-commercial purposes, such as clubs or charities. The members guarantee the payment of certain (usually nominal) amounts if the company goes into insolvent liquidation, but otherwise, they have no economic rights in relation to the company. This type of company is common in England. A company limited by guarantee may be with or without having share capital.\n- A company limited by shares is the most common form of the company used for business ventures. Specifically, a limited company is a \"company in which the liability of each shareholder is limited to the amount individually invested\" with corporations being \"the most common example of a limited company.\"[13] This type of company is common in England and many English-speaking countries. A company limited by shares may be a\n- A company limited by guarantee with a share capital is a hybrid entity, usually used where the company is formed for non-commercial purposes, but the activities of the company are partly funded by investors who expect a return. This type of company may no longer be formed in the UK, although provisions still exist in law for them to exist.[14]\n- An unlimited company with or without a share capital is a hybrid entity, a company where the liability of members or shareholders for the debts (if any) of the company are not limited. In this case, the doctrine of a veil of incorporation does not apply.\nLess common types of companies are:\n- Most corporations by letters patent are corporations sole and not companies as the term is commonly understood today.\n- Charter corporations were the only types of companies before the passing of modern companies legislation. Now they are relatively rare, except for very old companies that still survive (of which there are still many, particularly many British banks), or modern societies that fulfill a quasi-regulatory function (for example, the Bank of England is a corporation formed by a modern charter).\n- Statutory companies are certain companies that have been formed by a private statute passed in the relevant jurisdiction, and are relatively rare today.\n\"Ltd after the company's name signifies limited company, and PLC (public limited company) indicates that its shares are widely held.\"[15]\nIn legal parlance, the owners of a company are normally referred to as the \"members\". In a company limited or unlimited by shares (formed or incorporated with a share capital), this will be the shareholders. In a company limited by guarantee, this will be the guarantors. Some offshore jurisdictions have created special forms of offshore company in a bid to attract business for their jurisdictions. Examples include \"segregated portfolio companies\" and restricted purpose companies.\nThere are, however, many, many sub-categories of types of company that can be formed in various jurisdictions in the world.\nCompanies are also sometimes distinguished into public companies and private companies for legal and regulatory purposes. Public companies are companies whose shares can be publicly traded, often (although not always) on a stock exchange which imposes listing requirements/Listing Rules as to the issued shares, the trading of shares and a future issue of shares to help bolster the reputation of the exchange or particular market of exchange. Private companies do not have publicly traded shares, and often contain restrictions on transfers of shares. In some jurisdictions, private companies have maximum numbers of shareholders.\nA parent company is a company that owns enough voting stock in another firm to control management and operations by influencing or electing its board of directors; the second company being deemed as a subsidiary of the parent company. The subsidiary company can be allowed to maintain its own board of directors.[16] The definition of a parent company differs by jurisdiction, with the definition normally being defined by way of laws dealing with companies in that jurisdiction.[16]\nClassifications\n- Agriculture, such as the domestication of fish, animals, and livestock, as well as lumber, oil, vegetables, fruits, etc.",

      "raw_content": "CEO & Founder at Stoqd - a branding agency for some of the most successful companies, professional athletes and public figures in America.\nA quick look at any world-class organization or corporation reveals that they’re likely listed on Wikipedia. Wikipedia is one of the most popular websites worldwide. To become a recognized business, you want to increase your business’s visibility online. Why not extend your reach to top search results?\nWikipedia can be an excellent source of credibility, backlinks and organic traffic to your site. It can also enhance your business’s visibility. I’ve worked with hundreds of public figures, celebrities, professional athletes, politicians and more to help them accomplish what is explained in this article. It is important to note that getting yourself or your business listed on Wikipedia is no easy task, but with persistence it can be achievable.\nWhy should your business have a Wikipedia page?\nGetting your business listed on Wikipedia has many advantages, including the potential to attract new clients and build trust with existing ones, increase sales and perceived value, and it displays your company’s history, products and services.\nTips To Help Get Your Business Listed On Wikipedia\n1. Ensure your business is notable. If your business has been featured in the press, on social media or in newspapers, this counts as recognition, as many businesses are not reported on by the press. For a company to become notable, it must have a significant reputation in its industry. This reputation comes from the notice of third parties not affiliated with the organization.\n2. Find citations. Wikipedia strives to reflect high-quality, credible coverage of topics. Self-promotion and self-linking are prohibited. If you create a page for your business, include credible third-party sources. These can be news articles, blogs, forums, magazines, etc. Make sure the citations you include on your Wikipedia company pages are authentic. I’ve found that editors are more likely to approve pages with more independent citations than pages with no or very few citations.\n3. Look for references on other Wikipedia pages. If you are mentioned in one Wikipedia page, more editors may be likely to add you to another page they’re editing or pick your business when they create a new page. The more pages you are mentioned on, the easier it can be for other editors to find and add your information. You can build brand recognition and credibility by obtaining links and mentions from other Wikipedia pages.\n4. Research and scope out industry areas. Find out about other organizations and companies in your area of expertise, and see if they already have Wikipedia pages. Simply search for the company name and check the results that appear. If information on your industry already exists, create a page on a relevant topic and add entries that can work as citations. Or, you could repurpose old content and integrate it into your Wikipedia article as a citation.\n5. Become a Wikipedia contributor. If you want to start a business page on Wikipedia, join the community first. Start by contributing to other pages before you sign up and create your business’s article. You need to create and edit relevant Wikipedia pages in your niche to learn the process of editing.\n6. Create relationships with other Wikipedia contributors. When you write an article, you’ll be part of a larger community. Almost everything you do in writing an article will be visible to other Wikipedians, and they will judge your edits on their merits. This includes how much you know about the subject and whether your writing is clear, engaging and useful.\n7. Allow submissions from multiple users. To have a good Wikipedia page, I recommend to have several registered users contribute to it. Pages with no editing history are more likely to be flagged for deletion in my experience. You may be able to avoid this by having multiple users make edits to the page routinely.\n8. Actively promote discussion on the talk page. I’ve found that Wikipedia loves readers who engage in the article’s discussion page. Contributing comments or answering questions from other readers lets Wikipedia know that people care about a topic.\n9. Be neutral. Focus on writing an article that is neutral, concise and insightful. Concentrate on providing information that will benefit potential customers, not just advertise your business.\nGetting Started\nFirst I’ll start by saying that the best way to get your business listed on Wikipedia is to reach a notable status within your industry — in this case, a Wiki contributor may handle creating the page for you. However, you are able to become a contributor yourself, regardless of your accomplishments.\nTo get started, go to the Wikipedia website and create an account. After creating the account, become an autoconfirmed user, and edit ten articles from other users. I’ve found you have a greater chance of getting published if you contribute to improving users’ content.\nThen, create a Wikipedia page for your company or business. Include all information related to your company. This information must be relevant and valuable. It is at Wikipedia’s discretion whether or not they approve your article. Make sure you provide your business email address or phone number in case there is a problem with your page. If you’re writing the article yourself, you may want to seek advice from professional Wikipedia writers. (Disclosure: My company provides this service.)\nI believe that having an active Wikipedia page is crucial for a business. A Wikipedia article can help raise brand awareness and reach potential customers in ways traditional marketing cannot. It also polishes your Google results quite well. With these tips in place, you can get started on your journey of getting listed on Wikipedia.\nForbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders.

      "raw_content": "Business\nA business is a place where people work together. In a business, people work to make and sell products or services. Other people buy the products and services. The business owner is the person who hires people for work. A business can earn a profit for the products and services it offers. The word business comes from the word busy, and means doing things. It works on regular basis.\nOriginally, individual trades people were qualified, and they hired assistants. The invention of the joint-stock company meant a new era in business.[1] By this means, some people put up the money as capital, and others used it to run the business. There is a law which says this kind of company is a \"legal entity\": it has a legal life separate from its owners or shareholders. In this way, a company can outlive the people who started it. This idea was invented in medieval times, but really flowered in the 19th century.[2] It has spread around the world since then.\nMost businesses are created for commerce. There are big and small businesses. For example, one person can open a small barber-shop. A big business, like Microsoft, employs thousands of people all over the world.\nSome businesses need fixed locations. Examples are an office, store, or farm. For some businesses the worker goes to different locations. Examples are carpenters or electricians. They usually bring everything they need for work in their truck.\nBusiness can also mean the work or current state of a business. A business owner might say: \"I am doing a lot of business\" or \"My business is good\" or \"Business is bad\".\nThe term can also be used in a more general way. As a noun, it can be used, for example, to speak about a broad area of activity.[3]\nReferences\n[change | change source]- ↑ \"Chicago French Press\". West's Encyclopedia of American Law.

      "raw_content": "Business-to-business\nBusiness-to-business (B2B or, in some countries, BtoB) refers to trade and commercial activity where a business sees other businesses as its customer base. This typically occurs when:\n- A business sources materials for its production process for output (e.g., a food manufacturer purchasing salt), i.e. providing raw material to the other company that will produce output.\n- A business needs the services of another for operational reasons (e.g., a food manufacturer employing an accountancy firm to audit their finances).\n- A business re-sells goods and services produced by others (e.g., a retailer buying the end product from the food manufacturer).\nBusiness-to-business activity is thought to allow business segmentation.[1]\nB2B is often contrasted with business-to-consumer (B2C) trade.\nOrganization\n[edit]Successful B2B operations depend upon sales personnel understanding the purchasing behaviour and outlook of the types of business they wish to work with.[2]\nB2B involves specific challenges at different stages. At their formation, organizations should be careful to rely on an appropriate combination of contractual and relational mechanisms.[3] Specific combinations of contracts and relational norms may influence the nature and dynamics of the negotiations between firms.[4]\nBusiness to business models\n[edit]Vertical B2B model\n[edit]Vertical B2B is generally oriented to manufacturing or business. It can be divided into two directions: upstream and downstream. Producers or commercial retailers can have a supply relationship with upstream suppliers, including manufacturers, and form a sales relationship.[5] As an example, Dell works with upstream suppliers of integrated circuit microchips and computer printed circuit boards (PCBs).\nA vertical B2B website can be similar to the enterprise's online store.[5] Through the website, the company can promote its products vigorously, more efficiently, and more comprehensively, enriching transactions by helping customers better understand their products. Alternatively, the website can be created for business purposes, where the seller advertises their products to promote and expand transactions.\nA good example of a vertical B2B model is manufacturers vs wholesalers.\nHorizontal B2B model\n[edit]Horizontal B2B is the transaction pattern for the intermediate trading market.[clarification needed] It consolidates similar transactions from various industries into one platform, offering trading opportunities for both buyers and suppliers. Typically, it involves companies that do not own or sell the products but serve as a platform to connect sellers and buyers online.[6] The better platforms help buyers easily find information about the sellers and the relevant information about the products via the website.\nA good example of a horizontal B2B model is bankers vs corporate lawyers.\nGrowth of e-procurement\n[edit]A 2022 Amazon report highlighted a \"rapid transformation of B2B e-procurement in recent years\", with 91% of the B2B buyers surveyed in their study stating that they preferred online purchasing.[7]\nB2B2C\n[edit]B2B2C means \"business-to-business-to-consumer\". According to the TechTarget website, the purpose of the terminology is to \"extend the business-to-business model to include e-commerce for consumers\". An aim of B2B2C is to \"create a mutually beneficial relationship between suppliers of goods and services and online retailers\".[8] According to Lomate and Ramachandran, it enables manufacturers (the first \"B\" in B2B2C) to connect with, understand and serve their end customers (\"C\") without undermining their sales and distribution networks, including online sellers (the second \"B\") or excluding them from continuing customer engagement.[9]\nComparison with selling to consumers\n[edit]The defining difference between B2B and business-to-consumer trade (B2C) is that the first one refers to commerce transactions between manufacturer and retailer, and the second one it is the retailer supplying goods to the consumer.[10] In B2B commerce, it is often the case that the parties to the relationship have comparable negotiating power, and even when they do not, each party typically involves professional staff and legal counsel in the negotiation of terms, whereas within a B2C context, relationships are shaped to a far greater degree by the economic implications of information asymmetry. However, in B2B, large companies may have many commercial, resource and information advantages over smaller businesses. The United Kingdom government, for example, created the post of Small Business Commissioner under the Enterprise Act 2016 to \"enable small businesses to resolve disputes\" and \"consider complaints by small business suppliers about payment issues with larger businesses that they supply.\"[11]\nIn B2B there are business people on both sides, whereas in B2C there is normally one business person and one consumer. In the first case, the decision is pursued by need (because the other business needs it), and in the second case, they are expectations rather than needs. B2B has many sellers and different stores, whereas B2C, is usually just one supplier. B2B concentrates on raw data for another company, but B2C focuses on producing something for consumers. A B2B transaction entails direct-sourcing contract management, which involves negotiating terms that establish prices and various other factors such as volume-based pricing, carrier and logistics preferences, etc. B2C transaction is clearer, it has spot sourcing contract management that offers a flat retail rate for each item sold. Time is also different as B2B has a slower process than B2C which is concluded in shorter periods (that could be minutes or days).\nBusiness-to-business generally requires an upfront investment whereas business-to-consumers do not need a business to spend money on infrastructure. The last difference mentioned here is that in B2B, lagging in the digital transformation, has to deal with back-office connectivity and invoicing a number of different partners and suppliers, while B2C results in more seamless transactions as options, such as cyber-cash, allows the business to accept a wider variety of payment options. B2B typically only allows payment via credit card or invoice, making the purchasing process longer and more expensive than with B2C. B2B, as there are normally bigger amounts involved over longer periods of time, usually have higher costs than B2C, which consists of quick, daily transactions. Businesses typically want to buy on net terms, meaning that B2B merchants have to wait weeks, if not months to get paid for their goods or services. As a result, smaller businesses with less capital often struggle to stay afloat. In B2B, brand reputations greatly depend on the personal relationship between businesses. On the other hand, in B2C, the business's reputation is often fueled by publicity through the media.\nIn many cases, the overall volume of B2B (business-to-business) transactions is much higher than the volume of B2C transactions.[12][13][14] The primary reason for this is that in a typical supply chain there will be many B2B transactions involving subcomponents or raw materials, and only one B2C transaction, specifically the sale of the finished product to the end customer. For example, an automobile manufacturer makes several B2B transactions such as buying tires, glass for windows, and rubber hoses for its vehicles. The final transaction, a finished vehicle sold to the consumer, is a single (B2C) transaction.\nNational characteristics of B2B trade\n[edit]Business-to-business companies represent a significant part of the United States economy. This is especially true in firms with 500 employees and above, of which there were 19,464 in 2015,[15] where it is estimated that as many as 72% are businesses that primarily serve other businesses.",

      "raw_content": "Education\nEducation is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits and manifests in various forms. Formal education occurs within a structured institutional framework, such as public schools, following a curriculum. Non-formal education also follows a structured approach but occurs outside the formal schooling system, while informal education entails unstructured learning through daily experiences. Formal and non-formal education are categorized into levels, including early childhood education, primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education. Other classifications focus on teaching methods, such as teacher-centered and student-centered education, and on subjects, such as science education, language education, and physical education. Additionally, the term \"education\" can denote the mental states and qualities of educated individuals and the academic field studying educational phenomena.\nThe precise definition of education is disputed, and there are disagreements about the aims of education and the extent to which education differs from indoctrination by fostering critical thinking. These disagreements impact how to identify, measure, and enhance various forms of education. Essentially, education socializes children into society by instilling cultural values and norms, equipping them with the skills necessary to become productive members of society. In doing so, it stimulates economic growth and raises awareness of local and global problems. Organized institutions play a significant role in education. For instance, governments establish education policies to determine the timing of school classes, the curriculum, and attendance requirements. International organizations, such as UNESCO, have been influential in promoting primary education for all children.\nMany factors influence the success of education. Psychological factors include motivation, intelligence, and personality. Social factors, such as socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and gender, are often associated with discrimination. Other factors encompass access to educational technology, teacher quality, and parental involvement.\nThe primary academic field examining education is known as education studies. It delves into the nature of education, its objectives, impacts, and methods for enhancement. Education studies encompasses various subfields, including philosophy, psychology, sociology, and economics of education. Additionally, it explores topics such as comparative education, pedagogy, and the history of education.\nIn prehistory, education primarily occurred informally through oral communication and imitation. With the emergence of ancient civilizations, the invention of writing led to an expansion of knowledge, prompting a transition from informal to formal education. Initially, formal education was largely accessible to elites and religious groups. The advent of the printing press in the 15th century facilitated widespread access to books, thus increasing general literacy. In the 18th and 19th centuries, public education gained significance, paving the way for the global movement to provide primary education to all, free of charge, and compulsory up to a certain age. Presently, over 90% of primary-school-age children worldwide attend primary school.\nDefinitions\nThe term \"education\" originates from the Latin words educare, meaning \"to bring up,\" and educere, meaning \"to bring forth.\"[1] The definition of education has been explored by theorists from various fields.[2] Many agree that education is a purposeful activity aimed at achieving goals like the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits.[3] However, extensive debate surrounds its precise nature beyond these general features. One approach views education as a process occurring during events such as schooling, teaching, and learning.[4] Another perspective perceives education not as a process but as the mental states and dispositions of educated individuals resulting from this process.[5] Furthermore, the term may also refer to the academic field that studies the methods, processes, and social institutions involved in teaching and learning.[6] Having a clear understanding of the term is crucial when attempting to identify educational phenomena, measure educational success, and improve educational practices.[7]\nSome theorists provide precise definitions by identifying specific features exclusive to all forms of education. Education theorist R. S. Peters, for instance, outlines three essential features of education, including imparting knowledge and understanding to the student, ensuring the process is beneficial, and conducting it in a morally appropriate manner.[8] While such precise definitions often characterize the most typical forms of education effectively, they face criticism because less common types of education may occasionally fall outside their parameters.[9] Dealing with counterexamples not covered by precise definitions can be challenging, which is why some theorists prefer offering less exact definitions based on family resemblance instead. This approach suggests that all forms of education are similar to each other but need not share a set of essential features common to all.[10] Some education theorists, such as Keira Sewell and Stephen Newman, argue that the term \"education\" is context-dependent.[a][11]\nEvaluative or thick conceptions[b] of education assert that it is inherent in the nature of education to lead to some form of improvement. They contrast with thin conceptions, which offer a value-neutral explanation.[13] Some theorists provide a descriptive conception of education by observing how the term is commonly used in ordinary language. Prescriptive conceptions, on the other hand, define what constitutes good education or how education should be practiced.[14] Many thick and prescriptive conceptions view education as an endeavor that strives to achieve specific objectives,[15] which may encompass acquiring knowledge, learning to think rationally, and cultivating character traits such as kindness and honesty.[16]\nVarious scholars emphasize the importance of critical thinking in distinguishing education from indoctrination.[17] They argue that indoctrination focuses solely on instilling beliefs in students, regardless of their rationality;[18] whereas education also encourages the rational ability to critically examine and question those beliefs.[19] However, it is not universally accepted that these two phenomena can be clearly distinguished, as some forms of indoctrination may be necessary in the early stages of education when the child's mind is not yet fully developed. This is particularly relevant in cases where young children must learn certain things without comprehending the underlying reasons, such as specific safety rules and hygiene practices.[20]\nEducation can be characterized from both the teacher's and the student's perspectives. Teacher-centered definitions emphasize the perspective and role of the teacher in transmitting knowledge and skills in a morally appropriate manner.[21] On the other hand, student-centered definitions analyze education based on the student's involvement in the learning process, suggesting that this process transforms and enriches their subsequent experiences.[22] It is also possible to consider definitions that incorporate both perspectives. In this approach, education is seen as a process of shared experience, involving the discovery of a common world and the collaborative solving of problems.[23]\nTypes\nThere are several classifications of education. One classification depends on the institutional framework, distinguishing between formal, non-formal, and informal education. Another classification involves different levels of education based on factors such as the student's age and the complexity of the content. Further categories focus on the topic, teaching method, medium used, and funding.",

      "raw_content": "As part of the Department of Education’s final mission, the Department today initiated a reduction in force (RIF) impacting nearly 50% of the Department’s workforce. Impacted Department staff will be placed on administrative leave beginning Friday, March 21st.\n“Today’s reduction in force reflects the Department of Education’s commitment to efficiency, accountability, and ensuring that resources are directed where they matter most: to students, parents, and teachers,” said Secretary of Education Linda McMahon. “I appreciate the work of the dedicated public servants and their contributions to the Department. This is a significant step toward restoring the greatness of the United States education system.”\nThe Department of Education will continue to deliver on all statutory programs that fall under the agency’s purview, including formula funding, student loans, Pell Grants, funding for special needs students, and competitive grantmaking.\nAll divisions within the Department are impacted by the reduction, with some divisions requiring significant reorganization to better serve students, parents, educators, and taxpayers.\nBackground\nWhen President Trump was inaugurated, the Department’s workforce stood at 4,133 workers. After today’s actions, the Department’s workforce will total roughly 2,183 workers. Included in the reduction in force are nearly 600 employees who accepted voluntary resignation opportunities and retirement over the last seven weeks, including:\n- 259 employees accepted the Deferred Resignation Program\n- 313 employees accepted the Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment\nRemaining employees impacted by the reduction in force will be placed on administrative leave beginning next Friday, March 21. Pursuant to regulatory requirements and the Department’s collective bargaining agreement, all impacted employees will receive full pay and benefits until June 9th, as well as substantial severance pay or retirement benefits based upon their length of service.",

      "raw_content": "Education\nEducation is about learning skills and knowledge. It also means helping people to learn how to do things and support them to think about what they learn. It is also important for educators to teach ways to find and use information. Education needs research to find out how to make it better.[1][2]\nThrough education, the knowledge of society, country, and of the world is passed on from generation to generation. This may include education in morality, for example learning how to act as loyal, honest and effective citizen.\nEducation may help and guide individuals from one class to another. Educated people and groups can do things like help less-educated people and encourage them to get educated.\nTypes of education\n[change | change source]There are different ways to categorize education: for example, by age or subject. One way is to divide it into formal education, non-formal education, and informal education.\nFormal education is usually in school, where a person may learn basic, academic, or trade skills. Small children often attend a nursery or kindergarten but often formal education begins in elementary school and continues with secondary school. Post-secondary education, or higher education, is usually at a college or university which may grant an academic degree.\nOr, students may go to a City college where they learn practical skills. This way learners can become qualified to be plumbers, electricians, builders and similar occupations. These course have arrangements for students to get practical experience. Apprenticeship was the older way to do this,\nNon-formal education includes adult basic education, adult literacy education or school equivalency preparation. In non-formal education, someone who is not in school can learn to read, write, and other basic life or job skills. Home education, individualized instruction, such as programmed learning, distance learning and computer-assisted instruction are other possibilities.[3]\nInformal education is less organized.[4] It may be a parent (like a dad or mom) teaching a child how to make a meal or ride a bicycle. People can also get an informal education by reading many books from a library or educational websites. This may also be called self-education. Some famous people have been largely self-educated, like Alfred Russell Wallace.\nDistance Education is typically conducted through online platforms,[5] correspondence courses, or virtual classrooms, enabling flexible learning schedules and access for students who cannot attend traditional on-campus class\nThere are primary schools and secondary schools. In many places they are government funded. Colleges and universities usually charge fees, or tuition payments.\nLearning theories\n[change | change source]A developmental theory of learning was explained by psychologist Jean Piaget. It has four stages of learning through which children progress on their way to adulthood: the sensorimotor stage, pre-operational stage, concrete operational, and formal operational stages.[6]\nTeaching methods\n[change | change source]A teaching method is the way via which educational content is delivered by the teacher. For instance, group work is sometimes used rather than individual learning to make students grasp certain knowledge. There are many teaching methods, and the most effective one in a given (situation or) scenario depends on things like the subject matter and the learner's age and ability, or level of competence.[7][8]\nOne important part of teaching methods is to make sure that learners stay motivated, either through their own interest and curiosity or through rewards (that are outside of one's mind).[9]\nEducational assessment is the process of making documentation of the student's knowledge and skills; That can happen formally or informally and can take place before, during, or after the learning activity.\nAnother significant (part of teaching or) pedagogical element in many modern ways of educating, is that each lesson is part of a broad framework; The framework is (supposed to follow a syllabus or) governed by a syllabus; The syllabus can cover several months or years.[10]\nAccording to Herbartianism, teaching can be broken down into (parts or) phases. The first phase has to do with making the student's mind ready for new information. Subsequently (or thereafter), new ideas are (shown or) introduced to the learner and then linked to (ideas or) concepts that are already familiar to them..[11]\nRelated pages\n[change | change source]- Curriculum\n- Distance education\n- Homeschooling – education at home\n- Pedagogy\n- Inclusive education\n- Special education – education of students who have a disability\n- Subject (school)\n- Right to education\n- Studypool tips\nReferences\n[change | change source]- ↑ Anderson, Garry & Arsenault, Nancy 1998.

      "raw_content": "Education in the United States\nThe United States does not have a national or federal educational system. Although there are more than fifty independent systems of education (one run by each state and territory, the Bureau of Indian Education, and the Department of Defense Dependents Schools), there are a number of similarities between them. Education is provided in public and private schools and by individuals through homeschooling. Educational standards are set at the state or territory level by the supervising organization, usually a board of regents, state department of education, state colleges, or a combination of systems. The bulk of the $1.3 trillion in funding comes from state and local governments, with federal funding accounting for about $260 billion in 2021[9] compared to around $200 billion in past years.[2]\nBy state law, education is compulsory over an age range starting between five and eight and ending somewhere between ages sixteen and nineteen, depending on the state.[10] This requirement can be satisfied in public or state-certified private schools, or an approved home school program. Compulsory education is divided into three levels: elementary school, middle or junior high school, and high school. As of 2013, about 87% of school-age children attended state-funded public schools, about 10% attended tuition and foundation-funded private schools,[11] and roughly 3% were home-schooled.[12] Enrollment in public kindergartens, primary schools, and secondary schools declined by 4% from 2012 to 2022 and enrollment in private schools or charter schools for the same age levels increased by 2% each.[13]\nNumerous publicly and privately administered colleges and universities offer a wide variety of post-secondary education. Post-secondary education is divided into college, as the first tertiary degree, and graduate school. Higher education includes public and private research universities, usually private liberal arts colleges, community colleges, for-profit colleges, and many other kinds and combinations of institutions. College enrollment rates in the United States have increased over the long term.[14] At the same time, student loan debt has also risen to $1.5 trillion. The large majority of the world's top universities, as listed by various ranking organizations, are in the United States, including 19 of the top 25, and the most prestigious – Harvard University.[15][16][17][18] Enrollment in post-secondary institutions in the United States declined from 18.1 million in 2010 to 15.4 million in 2021.[19]\nTotal expenditures for American public elementary and secondary schools amounted to $927 billion in 2020–21 (in constant 2021–22 dollars).[20] In 2010, the United States had a higher combined per-pupil spending for primary, secondary, and post-secondary education than any other OECD country (which overlaps with almost all of the countries designated as being developed by the International Monetary Fund and the United Nations) and the U.S. education sector consumed a greater percentage of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) than the average OECD country.[21] In 2014, the country spent 6.2% of its GDP on all levels of education—1.0 percentage points above the OECD average of 5.2%.[22] In 2014, the Economist Intelligence Unit rated U.S. education as 14th best in the world. The Programme for International Student Assessment coordinated by the OECD currently ranks the overall knowledge and skills of American 15-year-olds as 19th in the world in reading literacy, mathematics, and science with the average American student scoring 495, compared with the OECD Average of 488.[23][24] In 2017, 46.4% of Americans aged 25 to 64 attained some form of post-secondary education.[5] 48% of Americans aged 25 to 34 attained some form of tertiary education, about 4% above the OECD average of 44%.[25][26][27] 35% of Americans aged 25 and over have achieved a bachelor's degree or higher.[28]\nHistory\n[edit]19th century\n[edit]New England encouraged its towns to support free public schools funded by taxation. In the early 19th century, Massachusetts took the lead in education reform and public education with programs designed by Horace Mann that were widely emulated across the North. Teachers were specially trained in normal schools and taught the three Rs (reading, writing, and arithmetic) and also history and geography. Public education was at the elementary level in most places.\nAfter the Civil War end in 1865, cities began building high schools. The South was far behind northern standards on every educational measure and gave weak support to its segregated all-black schools. However, northern philanthropy and northern churches provided assistance to private black colleges across the South. Religious denominations across the country set up their private colleges. States also opened state universities, but they were quite small until well into the 20th century.\nIn 1823, Samuel Read Hall founded the first normal school, the Columbian School in Concord, Vermont,[29][30] aimed at improving the quality of the burgeoning common school system by producing more qualified teachers.\nDuring Reconstruction, the United States Office of Education was created in an attempt to standardize educational reform across the country. At the outset, the goals of the Office were to track statistical data on schools and provide insight into the educational outcomes of schools in each state. While supportive of educational improvement, the office lacked the power to enforce policies in any state. Educational aims across the states in the nineteenth century were broad, making it difficult to create shared goals and priorities. States like Massachusetts, with long-established educational institutions, had well-developed priorities in place by the time the Office of Education was established. In the South and the West, however, newly formed common school systems had different needs and priorities.[31] Competing interests among state legislators limited the ability of the Office of Education to enact change.\nIn the mid-19th century, the rapidly increasing Catholic population led to the formation of parochial schools in the largest cities. Theologically oriented Episcopalian, Lutheran, and Jewish bodies on a smaller scale set up their own parochial schools. There were debates over whether tax money could be used to support them, with the answer typically being no. From about 1876, thirty-nine states passed a constitutional amendment to their state constitutions, called Blaine Amendment after James G. Blaine, one of their chief promoters, forbidding the use of public tax money to fund local parochial schools.\nStates passed laws to make schooling compulsory between 1852 (Massachusetts) and 1917 (Mississippi). They also used federal funding designated by the Morrill Land-Grant Acts of 1862 and 1890 to set up land grant colleges specializing in agriculture and engineering. By 1870, every state had free elementary schools,[32] albeit only in urban centers. According to a 2018 study in the Economic Journal, states were more likely to adopt compulsory education laws during the Age of Mass Migration (1850–1914) if they hosted more European immigrants with lower exposure to civic values.[33]\nFollowing Reconstruction the Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute was founded in 1881 as a state college, in Tuskegee, Alabama, to train \"Colored Teachers,\" led by Booker T. Washington, (1856–1915), who was himself a freed slave. His movement spread, leading many other Southern states to establish small colleges for \"Colored or Negro\" students entitled \"A. & M.\" (\"Agricultural and Mechanical\") or \"A. & T.\" (\"Agricultural and Technical\"), some of which later developed into state universities. Before the 1940s, there were very few black students at private or state colleges in the North and almost none in the South.",

      "raw_content": "Engineering\nEngineering is the practice of using natural science, mathematics, and the engineering design process[1] to solve problems within technology, increase efficiency and productivity, and improve systems. Modern engineering comprises many subfields which include designing and improving infrastructure, machinery, vehicles, electronics, materials, and energy systems.[2]\nThe discipline of engineering encompasses a broad range of more specialized fields of engineering, each with a more specific emphasis for applications of mathematics and science. See glossary of engineering.\nThe word engineering is derived from the Latin ingenium.[3]\nDefinition\nThe American Engineers' Council for Professional Development (ECPD, the predecessor of ABET)[4] has defined \"engineering\" as:\nThe creative application of scientific principles to design or develop structures, machines, apparatus, or manufacturing processes, or works utilizing them singly or in combination; or to construct or operate the same with full cognizance of their design; or to forecast their behavior under specific operating conditions; all as respects an intended function, economics of operation and safety to life and property.[5][6]\nHistory\nEngineering has existed since ancient times, when humans devised inventions such as the wedge, lever, wheel and pulley, etc.\nThe term engineering is derived from the word engineer, which itself dates back to the 14th century when an engine'er (literally, one who builds or operates a siege engine) referred to \"a constructor of military engines\".[7] In this context, now obsolete, an \"engine\" referred to a military machine, i.e., a mechanical contraption used in war (for example, a catapult). Notable examples of the obsolete usage which have survived to the present day are military engineering corps, e.g., the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\nThe word \"engine\" itself is of even older origin, ultimately deriving from the Latin ingenium (c. 1250), meaning \"innate quality, especially mental power, hence a clever invention.\"[8]\nLater, as the design of civilian structures, such as bridges and buildings, matured as a technical discipline, the term civil engineering[6] entered the lexicon as a way to distinguish between those specializing in the construction of such non-military projects and those involved in the discipline of military engineering.\nAncient era\nThe pyramids in ancient Egypt, ziggurats of Mesopotamia, the Acropolis and Parthenon in Greece, the Roman aqueducts, Via Appia and Colosseum, Teotihuacán, and the Brihadeeswarar Temple of Thanjavur, among many others, stand as a testament to the ingenuity and skill of ancient civil and military engineers. Other monuments, no longer standing, such as the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and the Pharos of Alexandria, were important engineering achievements of their time and were considered among the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.\nThe six classic simple machines were known in the ancient Near East. The wedge and the inclined plane (ramp) were known since prehistoric times.[9] The wheel, along with the wheel and axle mechanism, was invented in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) during the 5th millennium BC.[10] The lever mechanism first appeared around 5,000 years ago in the Near East, where it was used in a simple balance scale,[11] and to move large objects in ancient Egyptian technology.[12] The lever was also used in the shadoof water-lifting device, the first crane machine, which appeared in Mesopotamia c. 3000 BC,[11] and then in ancient Egyptian technology c. 2000 BC.[13] The earliest evidence of pulleys date back to Mesopotamia in the early 2nd millennium BC,[14] and ancient Egypt during the Twelfth Dynasty (1991–1802 BC).[15] The screw, the last of the simple machines to be invented,[16] first appeared in Mesopotamia during the Neo-Assyrian period (911–609) BC.[14] The Egyptian pyramids were built using three of the six simple machines, the inclined plane, the wedge, and the lever, to create structures like the Great Pyramid of Giza.[17]\nThe earliest civil engineer known by name is Imhotep.[6] As one of the officials of the Pharaoh, Djosèr, he probably designed and supervised the construction of the Pyramid of Djoser (the Step Pyramid) at Saqqara in Egypt around 2630–2611 BC.[18] The earliest practical water-powered machines, the water wheel and watermill, first appeared in the Persian Empire, in what are now Iraq and Iran, by the early 4th century BC.[19]\nKush developed the Sakia during the 4th century BC, which relied on animal power instead of human energy.[20] Hafirs were developed as a type of reservoir in Kush to store and contain water as well as boost irrigation.[21] Sappers were employed to build causeways during military campaigns.[22] Kushite ancestors built speos during the Bronze Age between 3700 and 3250 BC.[23] Bloomeries and blast furnaces were also created during the 7th centuries BC in Kush.[24][25][26][27]\nAncient Greece developed machines in both civilian and military domains. The Antikythera mechanism, an early known mechanical analog computer,[28][29] and the mechanical inventions of Archimedes, are examples of Greek mechanical engineering. Some of Archimedes' inventions, as well as the Antikythera mechanism, required sophisticated knowledge of differential gearing or epicyclic gearing, two key principles in machine theory that helped design the gear trains of the Industrial Revolution, and are widely used in fields such as robotics and automotive engineering.[30]\nAncient Chinese, Greek, Roman and Hunnic armies employed military machines and inventions such as artillery which was developed by the Greeks around the 4th century BC,[31] the trireme, the ballista and the catapult, the trebuchet by Chinese circa 6th-5th century BCE.[32]\nMiddle Ages\nThe earliest practical wind-powered machines, the windmill and wind pump, first appeared in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age, in what are now Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, by the 9th century AD.[33][34][35][36] The earliest practical steam-powered machine was a steam jack driven by a steam turbine, described in 1551 by Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf in Ottoman Egypt.[37][38]\nThe cotton gin was invented in India by the 6th century AD,[39] and the spinning wheel was invented in the Islamic world by the early 11th century,[40] both of which were fundamental to the growth of the cotton industry. The spinning wheel was also a precursor to the spinning jenny, which was a key development during the early Industrial Revolution in the 18th century.[41]\nThe earliest programmable machines were developed in the Muslim world. A music sequencer, a programmable musical instrument, was the earliest type of programmable machine. The first music sequencer was an automated flute player invented by the Banu Musa brothers, described in their Book of Ingenious Devices, in the 9th century.[42][43] In 1206, Al-Jazari invented programmable automata/robots. He described four automaton musicians, including drummers operated by a programmable drum machine, where they could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns.[44]\nBefore the development of modern engineering, mathematics was used by artisans and craftsmen, such as millwrights, clockmakers, instrument makers and surveyors. Aside from these professions, universities were not believed to have had much practical significance to technology.[45]: 32\nA standard reference for the state of mechanical arts during the Renaissance is given in the mining engineering treatise De re metallica (1556), which also contains sections on geology, mining, and chemistry. De re metallica was the standard chemistry reference for the next 180 years.[45]\nModern era\nThe science of classical mechanics, sometimes called Newtonian mechanics, formed the scientific basis of much of modern engineering.",

      "raw_content": "engineering\nNews •\nengineering, the application of science to the optimum conversion of the resources of nature to the uses of humankind. The field has been defined by the Engineers Council for Professional Development, in the United States, as the creative application of “scientific principles to design or develop structures, machines, apparatus, or manufacturing processes, or works utilizing them singly or in combination; or to construct or operate the same with full cognizance of their design; or to forecast their behaviour under specific operating conditions; all as respects an intended function, economics of operation and safety to life and property.” The term engineering is sometimes more loosely defined, especially in Great Britain, as the manufacture or assembly of engines, machine tools, and machine parts.\nThe words engine and ingenious are derived from the same Latin root, ingenerare, which means “to create.” The early English verb engine meant “to contrive.” Thus, the engines of war were devices such as catapults, floating bridges, and assault towers; their designer was the “engine-er,” or military engineer. The counterpart of the military engineer was the civil engineer, who applied essentially the same knowledge and skills to designing buildings, streets, water supplies, sewage systems, and other projects.\nAssociated with engineering is a great body of special knowledge; preparation for professional practice involves extensive training in the application of that knowledge. Standards of engineering practice are maintained through the efforts of professional societies, usually organized on a national or regional basis, with all members acknowledging a responsibility to the public over and above responsibilities to their employers or to other members of their society.\nThe function of the scientist is to know, while that of the engineer is to do. Scientists add to the store of verified systematized knowledge of the physical world, and engineers bring this knowledge to bear on practical problems. Engineering is based principally on physics, chemistry, and mathematics and their extensions into materials science, solid and fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, transfer and rate processes, and systems analysis.\nUnlike scientists, engineers are not free to select the problems that interest them. They must solve problems as they arise, and their solutions must satisfy conflicting requirements. Usually, efficiency costs money, safety adds to complexity, and improved performance increases weight. The engineering solution is the optimum solution, the end result that, taking many factors into account, is most desirable. It may be the most reliable within a given weight limit, the simplest that will satisfy certain safety requirements, or the most efficient for a given cost. In many engineering problems the social and environmental costs are significant.\nEngineers employ two types of natural resources—materials and energy. Materials are useful because of their properties: their strength, ease of fabrication, lightness, or durability; their ability to insulate or conduct; their chemical, electrical, or acoustical properties. Important sources of energy include fossil fuels (coal, petroleum, natural gas), wind, sunlight, falling water, and nuclear fission. Since most resources are limited, engineers must concern themselves with the continual development of new resources as well as the efficient utilization of existing ones.\nHistory of engineering\nThe first engineer known by name and achievement is Imhotep, builder of the Step Pyramid at Ṣaqqārah, Egypt, probably about 2550 bce. Imhotep’s successors—Egyptian, Persian, Greek, and Roman—carried civil engineering to remarkable heights on the basis of empirical methods aided by arithmetic, geometry, and a smattering of physical science. The Pharos (lighthouse) of Alexandria, Solomon’s Temple in Jerusalem, the Colosseum in Rome, the Persian and Roman road systems, the Pont du Gard aqueduct in France, and many other large structures, some of which endure to this day, testify to their skill, imagination, and daring. Of many treatises written by them, one in particular survives to provide a picture of engineering education and practice in classical times: Vitruvius’s De architectura, published in Rome in the 1st century ce, a 10-volume work covering building materials, construction methods, hydraulics, measurement, and town planning.\nIn construction, medieval European engineers carried technique, in the form of the Gothic arch and flying buttress, to a height unknown to the Romans. The sketchbook of the 13th-century French engineer Villard de Honnecourt reveals a wide knowledge of mathematics, geometry, natural and physical science, and draftsmanship.\nIn Asia, engineering had a separate but very similar development, with more and more sophisticated techniques of construction, hydraulics, and metallurgy helping to create advanced civilizations such as the Mongol empire, whose large, beautiful cities impressed Marco Polo in the 13th century.\nCivil engineering emerged as a separate discipline in the 18th century, when the first professional societies and schools of engineering were founded. Civil engineers of the 19th century built structures of all kinds, designed water-supply and sanitation systems, laid out railroad and highway networks, and planned cities. England and Scotland were the birthplace of mechanical engineering, as a derivation of the inventions of the Scottish engineer James Watt and the textile machinists of the Industrial Revolution. The development of the British machine-tool industry gave tremendous impetus to the study of mechanical engineering both in Britain and abroad.\nThe growth of knowledge of electricity—from Alessandro Volta’s original electric cell of 1800 through the experiments of Michael Faraday and others, culminating in 1872 in the Gramme dynamo and electric motor (named after the Belgian Zénobe-Théophile Gramme)—led to the development of electrical and electronics engineering. The electronics aspect became prominent through the work of such scientists as James Clerk Maxwell of Britain and Heinrich Hertz of Germany in the late 19th century. Major advances came with the development of the vacuum tube by Lee de Forest of the United States in the early 20th century and the invention of the transistor in the mid-20th century. In the late 20th century electrical and electronics engineers outnumbered all others in the world.\nChemical engineering grew out of the 19th-century proliferation of industrial processes involving chemical reactions in metallurgy, food, textiles, and many other areas. By 1880 the use of chemicals in manufacturing had created an industry whose function was the mass production of chemicals. The design and operation of the plants of this industry became a function of the chemical engineer.\nIn the late 20th and early 21st centuries the field of environmental engineering expanded to address global warming and sustainability. The development and deployment of renewable energy, such as solar and wind power, the creation of new technologies for carbon sequestration and pollution control, and the design of green architecture and environmentally friendly urban planning are all recent developments.\nEngineering functions\nProblem solving is common to all engineering work. The problem may involve quantitative or qualitative factors; it may be physical or economic; it may require abstract mathematics or common sense. Of great importance is the process of creative synthesis or design, putting ideas together to create a new and optimum solution.\nAlthough engineering problems vary in scope and complexity, the same general approach is applicable. First comes an analysis of the situation and a preliminary decision on a plan of attack. In line with this plan, the problem is reduced to a more categorical question that can be clearly stated.",

      "raw_content": "Subscribe to our newsletter to receive the latest news and events from TWI:\nEngineering is the application of science and maths to solve problems. While scientists and inventors come up with innovations, it is engineers who apply these discoveries to the real world.\nEngineering is part of STEM education, which aims to engage students with science, technology, engineering and mathematics yet, as a discipline, it has been practiced for thousands of years.\nYou can see examples of engineering in the Pyramids of Giza, at Stonehenge, the Parthenon and elsewhere. Yet, today’s engineers operate in many different areas as well as building structures.\nEngineers work on everything from cell membranes to construction and prosthetics to improving engine and transport efficiencies and developing renewable energy resources.\nWhile engineering dates right back to the invention of the wheel (and beyond), the term itself comes from the word engineer, which goes back to the 14th century, when an ‘engine’er’ meant someone who constructed military engines like catapults and other ‘siege engines.’ This military meaning can still be seen in use today with the Corps of Royal Engineers and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\nThe word ‘engine’ itself comes from the Latin word ‘ingenium’ (c. 1250), which means ‘innate quality, especially mental power, hence a clever invention.’\nEngineering developed beyond military applications and began to be applied to civilian structures like bridges and buildings, leading to the creation of the term civil engineering, to differentiate it from the original military engineering field.\nEngineers are involved in the design, evaluation, development, testing, modification, inspection and maintaining of a wide range of products, structures and systems. This involves everything from the recommending of materials and processes, overseeing manufacturing and construction processes, and conducting failure analysis and investigation, to providing consultancy services and teaching engineering to students and trainees.\nThere are many different types of engineering, often divided into areas in which the engineer operates. For example, engineers working within the oil and gas industry could be petroleum engineers, while those working in farming-related applications could be called agricultural engineers.\nWhile there are some traditional areas of engineering, such as mechanical and civil engineering, other engineering fields require an overlapping of different specialities. So, for example, a civil engineer may also need an understanding of structural engineering or an aerospace engineer may need to understand aspects of electrical or computer engineering too.\nThese types of engineering are commonly known as interdisciplinary engineering and include manufacturing engineering, acoustic engineering, corrosion engineering, aerospace, automotive, computer, textiles, geological, materials and nuclear engineering, among others. These areas of engineering are all among the branches of engineering that are represented by the 36 licensed member institutions of the UK Engineering Council.\nHere are some of the traditional and more common interdisciplinary engineering fields:\nMechanical engineers are involved in the design, manufacture, inspection and maintenance of machinery, equipment and components such as vehicles, engines, aerospace products, weapon systems, robotics, turbines, construction and farm machinery, as well as a wide range of tools and devices. This type of engineering is also associated with the management of control systems and instruments for measuring the performance and status of machinery.\nFind out more\nElectrical engineers work on the design, testing, manufacture, construction, control, monitoring and inspection of electrical and electronic devices, components, machines and systems. These range in size from the smallest microchips to large transmission and power generation systems. This includes everything from broadcast engineering to electromagnetic devices, computer systems, telecommunications and more.\nCivil engineers are involved in the design, construction, maintenance and inspection of large civil infrastructure projects, including roads, railways, bridges, tunnels and dams.\nWorking on both public and private projects, civil engineers traditionally work in sub-disciplines such as environmental engineering, structural engineering or surveying.\nAs mentioned above, civil engineering was originally created to differentiate it from military engineering.\nAs a specialised branch of mechanical and electrical engineering, aerospace engineering focuses on the design, manufacture and testing of aircraft and spacecraft, including all parts and components. Covering everything from vehicle aerodynamics and efficiencies to electrical control and navigation systems, much of the expertise is also used for other vehicles, such as cars.\nNuclear engineers work on the design, manufacture, construction, operation, and testing of the equipment, systems and processes for the production and control of nuclear power. From nuclear power plant reactors to particle accelerators, nuclear engineers also work on factors such as monitoring and the storage of nuclear waste in order to protect people from potentially harmful situations.\nBiomedical engineers are concerned with the design of systems, equipment and devices for use in healthcare and medicine. By working with medical specialists such as doctors, therapists and researchers, biomedical engineers are able to meet the requirements of healthcare professionals.\nChemical engineers use physics, chemistry, biology and engineering principles for the design of equipment, systems and processes for refining raw materials for mixing, compounding and processing chemicals for a variety of products. Carrying out processes on a commercial scale, chemical engineers are involved in processes ranging from petroleum refining to fermentation and the production of biomolecules.\nComputer engineers design computer hardware, systems, networks and software. Computer engineering combines other engineering disciplines, such as electrical engineering and computer science, as well as software engineering and design.\nIndustrial engineers design and optimise facilities, equipment and systems for manufacturing, materials processing and other industrial applications.\nEnvironmental engineers are concerned with the prevention, removal and elimination of sources of pollution that affect the environment. Measuring pollution levels, determining sources of pollution and cleaning up polluted areas, these engineers need to work in compliance with government regulations.\nMarine engineering is related to any engineering tasks on or near the oceans. This includes design and development for shipping, submarines, oil rigs, on-board, harbours, plants and more. This specialised area of engineering combines other types of engineering, including mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, civil engineering, and programming.\nGeotechnical engineering is an area of civil engineering that focuses on the engineering behaviour of earth materials. Using the principles of soil and rock mechanics, this subdiscipline of geological engineering uses knowledge of geology, geophysics, hydrology and more.\nEngineering has been a part of human history, in one form or another, for thousands of years. Of course, as our knowledge and understanding of science and mathematics grew, so our engineering expertise and competence also improved.\nToday’s engineers use the most advanced technologies, alongside established scientific principles, to apply cutting-edge solutions and innovation to real world challenges.\nIt is hard to over-emphasise the importance of engineering on human history, from designing transportation systems to powering our homes, engineering is all around us, right down to the device you are using to read this.",

      "raw_content": "Engineering\nEngineering is the use of science and math to design or make things. People who do engineering are called engineers. They learn engineering at a college or university. Engineers usually design or build things. Some engineers also use science, mathematics, and other skills to solve problems in technology. There are different types of engineers that design everything from computers and buildings to watches and websites. People have been creating and engineering things for thousands of years. Some become engineering managers.\nSpecialties\n[change | change source]Engineering is a big subject. Here are a few of the many types of engineers:\n- Aerospace engineers design space vehicles or airplanes.\n- Biomedical engineers design and work with medical equipment.\n- Ceramic engineers create objects from inorganic, non-metallic materials.\n- Chemical engineers use chemicals to make products like drugs and medicines or fertilizers for crops.\n- Civil engineers work on roads, bridges, buildings and other public structures.\n- Computer engineers design or improve computers (including embedded systems and their parts).\n- Electrical engineers work with electricity and design electrical equipment, from small things like radios and computers to large things like electric power transmission systems.\n- Electronic engineers work with electronics, which are used to build computer parts and electrical equipment.\n- Environmental engineers design and implement ways to remediate and restore the environment.\n- Manufacturing engineers design and improve the machines and assembly lines that make things. They work with robots and automation and ways to help companies work faster and better with fewer mistakes.\n- Mechanical engineers design machines or things that move, like cars and trains. A mechanical engineer also might help design electricity generating stations, oil refineries, and factories.\n- Mechatronics engineers work in multiple fields of engineering that include mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, telecommunications engineering, control engineering and computer engineering.\n- Marine engineers design, build, test and repair boats, ships, underwater craft, focusing primarily on their internal systems.\n- Nanotechnology engineers study very small things, like strings of atoms and how they are put together.\n- Nuclear engineers design and build nuclear plants. They also study the characteristic behaviors of certain radioactive or unstable elements.\n- Structural engineers work on design and analysis of buildings and other large structures to withstand both the gravity and wind loads as well as natural disasters.\n- Software engineers design and write programs for computers.\n- Systems engineers look at how complicated things work and try to make them faster and smarter.\nEngineers do not only work with machines. They also work a lot with other people.[1] Many engineering projects are large and very complicated. Often different kinds of engineers work together and help each other. As an example, computer engineers need help from electrical engineers to build a computer. The computer needs programs written by software engineers. The computer could be used by aerospace engineers to control an airplane. An airplane is a big mechanical system with many parts, so a mechanical engineer and a systems engineer are also needed.\nStudy\n[change | change source]Most (but not all) engineers have had years of training. Much of their training involves learning to work within limited budgetary and material constraints (limits).\nAmerican courses\n[change | change source]In the United States, most engineers go to a college or university to get an engineering degree. Most people go to school for four years to get a bachelor's degree in engineering. A Master's Degree is an advanced degree, usually requiring two more years of study after the Bachelors. A person with a master's degree is eligible to enter a Doctoral program in engineering. A graduate of a Doctoral program is awarded a Doctor of Philosophy degree, which is commonly called a PhD. A PhD in engineering requires three or four years of study after a master's degree, and includes the completion of a long research report called a dissertation. After having gained enough work experience, one can sit for their Professional Engineer's (PE) License, reinforcing their demonstrated proficiency in their specialty.\nBritish courses\n[change | change source]In the United Kingdom, engineering degrees at universities are either three year BEng (Bachelor of Engineering) or four year MEng (Master of Engineering). In many universities it is common to take only one engineering discipline (e.g. aeronautical or civil engineering) although some universities have a general engineering degree. British universities may also offer Doctoral programs as a doctor of philosophy (PhD) or a doctor of engineering (EngD). Engineers of all disciplines have common approaches to solving problems including teamwork, communication, and an Iterative design process.\nEngineers can also get additional recognition in the form of becoming Chartered. A chartered engineer is one who has his degree or doctorate has been recognised by a group of professionals such as the IET (Institute of Engineering and Technology), IMechE (Institution of Mechanical Engineers), IChemE (Institution of Chemical Engineers) or ICE (Institution of Civil Engineers). Experience and responsibility enables a further step of recognition by becoming a Fellow of these institutions.\nFrench courses\n[change | change source]The best way to become an engineer in France is to take the CPGE (Classe Préparatoire pour les Grandes Écoles is the French class for engineer's school) for two years and then study for three years in an \"École d'Ingénieur\" (Engineer's school). You can also study in an IUT (Institut universitaire technologique) for two years, and then study three years in an \"École d'Ingénieur\".\nNotes\n[change | change source]- ↑ \"Principles of Ethical conduct in Engineering Practice Under The North American Free Trade Agreement\".

      "raw_content": "Engineer\nEngineers, as practitioners of engineering, are professionals who invent, design, analyze, build and test machines, complex systems, structures, gadgets and materials to fulfill functional objectives and requirements while considering the limitations imposed by practicality, regulation, safety and cost.[1][2] The word engineer (Latin ingeniator,[3] the origin of the Ir. in the title of engineer in countries like Belgium, The Netherlands, and Indonesia) is derived from the Latin words ingeniare (\"to contrive, devise\") and ingenium (\"cleverness\").[4][5] The foundational qualifications of a licensed professional engineer typically include a four-year bachelor's degree in an engineering discipline, or in some jurisdictions, a master's degree in an engineering discipline plus four to six years of peer-reviewed professional practice (culminating in a project report or thesis) and passage of engineering board examinations.\nThe work of engineers forms the link between scientific discoveries and their subsequent applications to human and business needs and quality of life.[1]\nDefinition\n[edit]In 1961, the Conference of Engineering Societies of Western Europe and the United States of America defined \"professional engineer\" as follows:[6]\nA professional engineer is competent by virtue of his/her fundamental education and training to apply the scientific method and outlook to the analysis and solution of engineering problems. He/she is able to assume personal responsibility for the development and application of engineering science and knowledge, notably in research, design, construction, manufacturing, superintending, managing, and in the education of the engineer. His/her work is predominantly intellectual and varied and not of a routine mental or physical character. It requires the exercise of original thought and judgment and the ability to supervise the technical and administrative work of others. His/her education will have been such as to make him/her capable of closely and continuously following progress in his/her branch of engineering science by consulting newly published works on a worldwide basis, assimilating such information, and applying it independently. He/she is thus placed in a position to make contributions to the development of engineering science or its applications. His/her education and training will have been such that he/she will have acquired a broad and general appreciation of the engineering sciences as well as thorough insight into the special features of his/her own branch. In due time he/she will be able to give authoritative technical advice and assume responsibility for the direction of important tasks in his/her branch.\nRoles and expertise\n[edit]Design\n[edit]Engineers develop new technological solutions. During the engineering design process, the responsibilities of the engineer may include defining problems, conducting and narrowing research, analyzing criteria, finding and analyzing solutions, and making decisions. Much of an engineer's time is spent on researching, locating, applying, and transferring information.[7] Indeed, research suggests engineers spend 56% of their time engaged in various information behaviours, including 14% actively searching for information.[8]\nEngineers must weigh different design choices on their merits and choose the solution that best matches the requirements and needs. Their crucial and unique task is to identify, understand, and interpret the constraints on a design in order to produce a successful result. Good problem solving skills are an important asset for engineers.\nAnalysis\n[edit]Engineers apply techniques of engineering analysis in testing, production, or maintenance. Analytical engineers may supervise production in factories and elsewhere, determine the causes of a process failure, and test output to maintain quality. They also estimate the time and cost required to complete projects. Supervisory engineers are responsible for major components or entire projects. Engineering analysis involves the application of scientific analytic principles and processes to reveal the properties and state of the system, device or mechanism under study. Engineering analysis proceeds by separating the engineering design into the mechanisms of operation or failure, analyzing or estimating each component of the operation or failure mechanism in isolation, and recombining the components. They may analyze risk.[9][10][11][12]\nMany engineers use computers to produce and analyze designs, to simulate and test how a machine, structure, or system operates, to generate specifications for parts, to monitor the quality of products, and to control the efficiency of processes.\nSpecialization and management\n[edit]Most engineers specialize in one or more engineering disciplines.[1] Numerous specialties are recognized by professional societies, and each of the major branches of engineering has numerous subdivisions. Civil engineering, for example, includes structural engineering, along with transportation engineering, geotechnical engineering, and materials engineering, including ceramic, metallurgical, and polymer engineering. Mechanical engineering cuts across most disciplines since its core essence is applied physics. Engineers also may specialize in one industry, such as motor vehicles, or in one type of technology, such as turbines or semiconductor materials.[1]\nSeveral recent studies have investigated how engineers spend their time; that is, the work tasks they perform and how their time is distributed among these. Research[8][13] suggests that there are several key themes present in engineers' work: technical work (i.e., the application of science to product development), social work (i.e., interactive communication between people), computer-based work and information behaviors. Among other more detailed findings, a 2012 work sampling study[13] found that engineers spend 62.92% of their time engaged in technical work, 40.37% in social work, and 49.66% in computer-based work. Furthermore, there was considerable overlap between these different types of work, with engineers spending 24.96% of their time engaged in technical and social work, 37.97% in technical and non-social, 15.42% in non-technical and social, and 21.66% in non-technical and non-social.\nEngineering is also an information-intensive field, with research finding that engineers spend 55.8% of their time engaged in various different information behaviors, including 14.2% actively seeking information from other people (7.8%) and information repositories such as documents and databases (6.4%).[8]\nThe time engineers spend engaged in such activities is also reflected in the competencies required in engineering roles. In addition to engineers' core technical competence, research has also demonstrated the critical nature of their personal attributes, project management skills, and cognitive abilities to success in the role.[14]\nTypes of engineers\n[edit]There are many branches of engineering, each of which specializes in specific technologies and products. Typically, engineers will have deep knowledge in one area and basic knowledge in related areas. For example, mechanical engineering curricula typically include introductory courses in electrical engineering, computer science, materials science, metallurgy, mathematics, and software engineering.\nAn engineer may either be hired for a firm that requires engineers on a continuous basis, or may belong to an engineering firm that provides engineering consulting services to other firms.\nWhen developing a product, engineers typically work in interdisciplinary teams. For example, when building robots an engineering team will typically have at least three types of engineers. A mechanical engineer would design the body and actuators. An electrical engineer would design the power systems, sensors, electronics, embedded software in electronics, and control circuitry.",

      "raw_content": "Providing adequate and beneficial healthcare to the growing and aging population is one of the most pressing problems of the twenty-first century. But this problem is solvable, especially as more and more individuals enroll and pursue an education in health science.\nHealth science is one of the most diverse areas of study in the United States right now, with students of all economic and educational backgrounds wanting to learn how to help others.\nHowever, as you research prospective programs, you may be wondering…\nWhat is Health Science, Exactly?\nHealth science is the study of applied science that deals with human physical and behavioral wellbeing.\nA Health Science degree is the award granted to graduates of this science-focused program. It is typically offered at the bachelor’s degree level.\nStudents completing a Health Science degree can kick off careers in either a research or care application capacity.\nResearch capacities are typically lab-based, investigative occupations that require someone to constantly push the envelope and develop new medial processes – such as oncology or cancer research.\nApplication capacities, on the other hand, are hands-on professions that require direct work with patients or tests that patients need to recover their health.\nPursuing a Health Science Degree\nStudents can start learning and pursuing their interests in health science as early as middle school. Then continue that pursuit throughout high school, career and technical centers (CTC), and in post-secondary institutions.\nHowever, health science in postsecondary institutions is where students learn about the aforementioned research-based career courses, application-based career courses, and take advanced health science courses.\nPostsecondary health science education is much more complex and expansive than it is in middle school, high school, or CTCs. This is because students have the opportunity to continue their education to earn advanced degrees, including doctorates. Not to mention, postsecondary institutions are also where students learn more about the research elements of health science, in addition to the previously learned process-oriented rudiments. With this knowledge, students continue on to learn about specialized medical professions like oncology, radiology, pediatrics, and more.\nHealth science degree students often go on to pursue advance, master’s and doctorate level education after their undergraduate study. For example, at UB, many Health Science degree holders go on to earn their Master’s in Nutrition or Master’s in Public Health . They may also take pre-med courses that prepare them to become medical doctors, surgeons, chiropractors, and other licensed professionals – in contrast to professions that only require a certification.\nEarning a Bachelor’s Degree in Health Science\nThe Bachelor of Science (BS) in Health Sciences program builds upon a common foundation, consisting of courses in:\n- General education\n- Biology\n- Chemistry\n- Health Sciences such as:\n○ Medical terminology\n○ Biostatistics\n○ Research\n○ Epidemiology\nStudents also select one concentration from the four areas of:\n- Community health education\n- Exercise and fitness\n- Nutrition\n- Pre-professional\nLet’s explore those four concentrations a little more in depth.\nHealth Sciences: Community Health Education\nStudents who earn a BS degree in Health Sciences, with a focus on Community Health Education, will be prepared for a career that seeks to improve the health of individuals and communities.\nThey will gain knowledge and experience that protects and promotes public health through healthy promotion, health education, and disease prevention programs and activities. Students in this career track aim to reduce disease, promote healthy behaviors, encourage the use of available healthcare services, and reduce healthcare cost.\nGraduates of this concentration are also eligible to earn a Community Health Education Specialist (CHES) certification from the National Commission for Health Education Credentialing, Inc.\nHealth Sciences: Exercise and Fitness\nStudents in the exercise and fitness concentration of Health Sciences will be prepared to understand principles involved in exercise science and general fitness.

You can pull out the herbs and look at them, whether in class or in between classes to get that extra studying in.\n\"There are a lot of things that I love about the program at SCU. The first one is that the faculty come from a long line of Ayurvedic knowledge deeply rooted in ancient classical text. They studied Ayurveda, but they also lived it. When you learn from people who embody this wisdom, it's much easier to grasp this knowledge. The second thing I love is the camaraderie within the cohort. The combination of the training, supportive faculty, and the support of my peers and classmates has given me the confidence I need to start my own practice.\"\nSome of my favorite courses at SCU have to be the chiropractic procedure classes; those are the classes you get to hone in on your chiro skills, your palpation skills and ultimately work on the adjustments that make you a chiropractor.

The five-pound piece was first struck in 1820 as a pattern coin. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction of Una and the Lion (pictured) by William Wyon. In 1887 and 1902 it was struck in small numbers at the Sydney Mint. A five-pound coin struck in preparation for the coinage of Edward VIII sold in 2021 for £1,654,000, the highest price paid for a British coin. Since 1980, it has been struck in most years by the Royal Mint for sale to collectors and investors.

The content includes medicine, public health, nursing, pharmacy, dentistry, nutrition, kinesiology and other health sciences resources.[1]\nAims\n[edit]The website aims to provide quality educational resources to health care providers in training and practice, especially in developing countries, thus bridging the digital divide (the global imbalance in access to information technology). The underlying aim is to support the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals of public health,[2] but it is also intended to be useful for providers in industrialized countries. The hope is to create revolutions in democratizing health sciences education.[3]\nThe four pillars of HSO are being comprehensive, authoritative, ad-free and free. The next step for HSO is to become an online health sciences learning centre, providing credentials and distance education degrees to help satisfy the great need for more and better-prepared health care professionals worldwide.[citation needed]\nHSO is an official supporting organisation of \"Healthcare Information For All by 2015\".[citation needed]\nHistory\n[edit]HSO was conceived of by Founder and Executive Director Erica Frank in 2001. A pilot of the site ran from 2006 until 2008, first only covering HIV/AIDS, and then moving on to include the entire site. The pilot ran in 11 countries in North America, Africa and Asia in order to assess the function, user interface, features, expectations, and needs of the users of HSO. The pilot was provided to health professionals at various levels of training and in practice.[4]\nFounding collaborators\n[edit]Founding collaborators include the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Bank, the American College of Preventive Medicine, the University of British Columbia, and the World Medical Association.[citation needed]\nFunding has been obtained from the Canadian and British Columbian governments, the World Health Organization, NATO’s Science for Peace Program, the Annenberg Physician Training Program, the Ulrich and Ruth Frank Foundation for International Health, and others. There has also been a large cadre of volunteers who have worked on the site's development.[citation needed]\nSearch engine\n[edit]HSO uses the Velocity Search Platform provided by Vivisimo to search all of its collected resources. In addition, Google Translate is used to provide results in 42 different languages.\nResources\n[edit]HSO is a web portal for searching health sciences resources that have been selected by a core team of volunteers, including health providers and scientists from different countries. The resources have been selected based on guidelines produced by several groups that help in assessing the quality of online health information.[5][6][7][8][9][10]\nThe criteria used include:\n- the content should be relevant\n- the information is useful by itself as a teaching/learning tool (i.e., no Microsoft PowerPoint presentations without lecture notes or taped audio)\n- the website should be educational (i.e., no advertisements)\n- the source should be credible (i.e., a government, university, or specialty society)\n- the material should be current\n- the links on the site should be functional\n- the interface of the website should be user-friendly, and\n- the material should be free to access.\nCurrently, HSO indexes over 50,000 resources.

      "raw_content": "Humanities\nHumanities are academic disciplines that study aspects of human society and culture, including certain fundamental questions asked by humans. During the Renaissance, the term \"humanities\" referred to the study of classical literature and language, as opposed to the study of religion, or \"divinity\". The study of the humanities was a key part of the secular curriculum in universities at the time. Today, the humanities are more frequently defined as any fields of study outside of natural sciences, social sciences, formal sciences (like mathematics), and applied sciences (or professional training).[1] They use methods that are primarily critical, speculative, or interpretative and have a significant historical element[1]—as distinguished from the mainly empirical approaches of science.[1]\nThe humanities include the academic study of philosophy, religion, history, language arts (literature, writing, oratory, rhetoric, poetry, etc.), the performing arts (theater, music, dance, etc.), and the visual arts (painting, sculpture, photography, filmmaking, etc.).[2]\nThe word humanities comes from the Renaissance Latin phrase studia humanitatis, which translates to the study of humanity. The studia humanitatis was a course of studies that consisted of grammar, literature, rhetoric, history, and moral philosophy, primarily derived from the study of Latin and Greek classics.The related Latin word humanitas inspired the Renaissance Italian neologism umanisti, or \"humanists\" which referred to scholars dedicated to these fields and were instrumental in reviving classical learning, a hallmark of \"Renaissance humanism.\"[3][4] (The term humanist can also describe the philosophical position of humanism, which antihumanist scholars in the humanities reject.)\nHistorically, the humanities have been distinguished from the social sciences by their methods and objectives.[1] While both fields study human behavior and culture, the humanities adopt an idiographic approach (focusing on the unique and context-specific), emphasizing critical, interpretative, and speculative methods, often with an emphasis on historical context and subjective meaning. In contrast, the social sciences employ a nomothetic approach (seeking general laws and patterns) through empirical and quantitative analysis, a distinction first conceptualized by philosopher Wilhelm Windelband.[5] This methodological distinction, however, is not absolute. Although sociology, anthropology, archaeology, linguistics, and psychology are commonly classified as social sciences, these fields include scholars who employ qualitative methods closely related to those employed by humanities scholars, such as narrative inquiry, textual analysis, or historical methods.[6]\nThe humanities have also been justified as fostering self-reflection, civic responsibility, and cultural continuity. Though debates persist about the practical utility of the humanities, proponents argue that their unique focus on meaning, creativity, and critical inquiry contributes both to individual enrichment and the public sphere.[7][8][9]\nFields\n[edit]Classics\n[edit]Classics, in the Western academic tradition, refers to the studies of the cultures of classical antiquity, namely Ancient Greek and Latin and the Ancient Greek and Roman cultures. Classical studies is considered one of the cornerstones of the humanities; however, its popularity declined during the 20th century. Nevertheless, the influence of classical ideas on many humanities disciplines, such as philosophy and literature, remains strong.[10]\nHistory\n[edit]History is systematically collected information about the past. When used as the name of a field of study, history refers to the study and interpretation of the record of humans, societies, institutions, and any topic that has changed over time.\nTraditionally, the study of history has been considered a part of the humanities. In modern academia, history can occasionally be classified as a social science, though this definition is contested.\nLanguage\n[edit]While the scientific study of language is known as linguistics and is generally considered a social science,[11] a natural science[12] or a cognitive science,[13] the study of languages is also central to the humanities. A good deal of twentieth- and twenty-first-century philosophy has been devoted to the analysis of language and to the question of whether, as Wittgenstein claimed, many of our philosophical confusions derive from the vocabulary we use; literary theory has explored the rhetorical, associative, and ordering features of language; and historical linguists have studied the development of languages across time. Literature, covering a variety of uses of language including prose forms (such as the novel), poetry and drama, also lies at the heart of the modern humanities curriculum. College-level programs in a foreign language usually include study of important works of the literature in that language, as well as the language itself.\nLaw\n[edit]In everyday language, law refers to a rule that is enforced by a governing institution, as opposed to a moral or ethical rule that is not subject to formal enforcement.[14] The study of law can be seen as either a social science or a humanities discipline, depending on one's perspective. Some see it as a social science because of its objective and measurable nature, while others view it as a humanities discipline because of its focus on values and interpretation. Law is not always enforceable, especially in the international relations context. Law has been defined in various ways, such as \"a system of rules\",[15] \"an interpretive concept\" for achieving justice,[16] \"an authority\" to mediate between people's interests,[17] or \"the command of a sovereign\" backed by the threat of punishment.[18]\nHowever one likes to think of law, it is a completely central social institution. Legal policy is shaped by the practical application of ideas from many social science and humanities disciplines, including philosophy, history, political science, economics, anthropology, and sociology. Law is politics, because politicians create them. Law is philosophy, because moral and ethical persuasions shape their ideas. Law tells many of history's stories, because statutes, case law and codifications build up over time. Law is also economics, because any rule about contract, tort, property law, labour law, company law and many more can have long-lasting effects on how productivity is organised and the distribution of wealth. The noun law derives from the Old English word lagu, meaning something laid down or fixed,[15] and the adjective legal comes from the Latin word LEX.[16]\nLiterature\n[edit]Literature is a term that does not have a universally accepted definition, but which has variably included all written work; writing that possesses literary merit; and language that emphasizes its own literary features, as opposed to ordinary language. Etymologically the term derives from the Latin word literatura/litteratura which means \"writing formed with letters\", although some definitions include spoken or sung texts. Literature can be classified as fiction or non-fiction; poetry or prose. It can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorised according to historical periods, or according to their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre).\nPhilosophy\n[edit]Philosophy—etymologically, the \"love of wisdom\"—is generally the study of problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, justification, truth, justice, right and wrong, beauty, validity, mind, and language. Philosophy is distinguished from other ways of addressing these issues by its critical, generally systematic approach and its reliance on reasoned argument, rather than experiments (experimental philosophy being an exception).",

      "raw_content": "humanities\n- Key People:\n- Wilhelm Dilthey\n- Charles Homer Haskins\n- Related Topics:\n- historiography\n- social science\n- geography\n- humanism\n- art criticism\nhumanities, those branches of knowledge that concern themselves with human beings and their culture or with analytic and critical methods of inquiry derived from an appreciation of human values and of the unique ability of the human spirit to express itself. As a group of educational disciplines, the humanities are distinguished in content and method from the physical and biological sciences and, somewhat less decisively, from the social sciences. The humanities include the study of all languages and literatures, the arts, history, and philosophy. The humanities are sometimes organized as a school or administrative division in many colleges and universities in the United States.\nThe modern conception of the humanities has its origin in the Classical Greek paideia, a course of general education dating from the Sophists in the mid-5th century bce, which prepared young men for active citizenship in the polis, or city-state; and in Cicero’s humanitas (literally, “human nature”), a program of training proper for orators, first set forth in De oratore (Of the Orator) in 55 bce. In the early Middle Ages the Church Fathers, including St. Augustine, himself a rhetorician, adapted paideia and humanitas—or the bonae (“good”), or liberales (“liberal”), arts, as they were also called—to a program of basic Christian education; mathematics, linguistic and philological studies, and some history, philosophy, and science were included.\nThe word humanitas, although not the substance of its component disciplines, dropped out of common use in the later Middle Ages but underwent a flowering and a transformation in the Renaissance. The term studia humanitatis (“studies of humanity”) was used by 15th-century Italian humanists to denote secular literary and scholarly activities (in grammar, rhetoric, poetry, history, moral philosophy, and ancient Greek and Latin studies) that the humanists thought to be essentially humane and Classical studies rather than divine ones. In the 18th century, Denis Diderot and the French Encyclopédistes censured studia humanitatis for what they claimed had by then become its dry, exclusive concentration on Latin and Greek texts and language. By the 19th century, when the purview of the humanities expanded, the humanities had begun to take their identity not so much from their separation from the realm of the divine as from their exclusion of the material and methods of the maturing physical sciences, which tended to examine the world and its phenomena objectively, without reference to human meaning and purpose.\nContemporary conceptions of the humanities resemble earlier conceptions in that they propose a complete educational program based on the propagation of a self-sufficient system of human values. But they differ in that they also propose to distinguish the humanities from the social sciences as well as from the physical sciences, and in that they dispute among themselves as to whether an emphasis on the subject matter or on the methods of the humanities is most effectual in accomplishing this distinction. In the late 19th century the German philosopher Wilhelm Dilthey called the humanities “the spiritual sciences” and “the human sciences” and described them, simply, as those areas of knowledge that lay outside of, and beyond, the subject matter of the physical sciences. On the other hand, Heinrich Rickert, an early 20th-century Neo-Kantian, argued that it is not subject matter but method of investigation that best characterizes the humanities; Rickert contended that whereas the physical sciences aim to move from particular instances to general laws, the human sciences are “idiographic”—they are devoted to the unique value of the particular within its cultural and human contexts and do not seek general laws. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries the American philosopher Martha Nussbaum emphasized the crucial importance of education in the humanities for maintaining a healthy democracy, for fostering a deeper understanding of human concerns and values, and for enabling students to rise above parochial perspectives and “the bondage of habit and custom” to become genuine citizens of the world.",

      "raw_content": "Humanities\nThe Humanities exam tests general knowledge of classical to contemporary literature, art, and music and other performing arts.\nOverview\nThe Humanities exam tests general knowledge of literature, art, and music and the other performing arts. It is broad in its coverage, with questions on all periods from classical to contemporary and in many different fields: poetry, prose, philosophy, art, architecture, music, dance, theater, and film. The exam requires test takers to demonstrate their understanding of the humanities through recollection of specific information, comprehension and application of concepts, and analysis and interpretation of various works of art.\nBecause the exam is very broad in its coverage, it is unlikely that any one person will be well informed about all the fields it covers. The exam contains approximately 140 questions to be answered in 90 minutes. Some of these are pretest questions that will not be scored.\nFor test takers with satisfactory scores on the Humanities exam, colleges may grant credit toward fulfillment of a distribution requirement. Some may grant credit for a particular course that matches the exam in content.\nNote: This exam uses the chronological designations b.c.e. (before the common era) and c.e. (common era). These labels correspond to b.c. (before Christ) and a.d. (anno Domini), which are used in some textbooks.\nKnowledge and Skills Required\nQuestions on the Humanities exam require test takers to demonstrate the abilities listed below, in the approximate percentages indicated. Some questions may require more than one of the abilities.\n- Knowledge of factual information (authors, works, etc.) (50% of the exam)\n- Recognition of techniques such as rhyme scheme, medium, and matters of style, and the ability to identify them as characteristics of certain writers, artists, schools, or periods (30% of the exam)\n- Understanding and interpretation of literary passages and art reproductions that are likely to be unfamiliar to most test takers (20% of the exam)\nThe subject matter of the Humanities exam is drawn from the following topics. The percentages next to the topics indicate the approximate percentages of exam questions on those topics.\nLiterature (50%)\n- 10% Drama\n- 10%–15% Poetry\n- 15%–20% Fiction\n- 10% Nonfiction (including philosophy)\nThe Arts (50%)\n- 20% Visual arts: painting, sculpture, etc.\n- 5% Visual arts: architecture\n- 15% Performing arts: music\n- 10% Performing arts: film, dance, etc.\nThe exam questions, drawn from the entire history of art and culture, are fairly evenly divided among the following periods: Classical, Medieval and Renaissance, 17th and 18th centuries, 19th century, and 20th century. At least 5–10% of the questions draw on other cultures, such as African, Asian, and Latin American. Some of the questions cross disciplines and/or chronological periods, and a substantial number test knowledge of terminology, genre, and style.\nScore Information\nACE Recommendation for Humanities\nNote: Each institution reserves the right to set its own credit-granting policy, which may differ from the American Council on Education (ACE).

      "raw_content": "TUCSON, Ariz. — Olivia Howe was hesitant at first to add French to her major in finance at the University of Arizona, fearing that it wouldn’t be very useful in the labor market.\nThen her language skills helped her land a job at the multinational technology company Siemens, which will be waiting for her when she graduates this spring.\n“The reason I got the job is because of my French. I didn’t see it as a practical choice, but now I do,” said Howe, who, to communicate with colleagues and clients, also plans to take up German. “The humanities taught me I could do it.”\nThe simple message that majoring in the humanities pays off is being pushed aggressively by this university and a handful of others; they hope to reverse decades of plummeting enrollment in subjects that teach skills employers say they need from graduates but aren’t getting.\nThe number of undergraduates majoring in the humanities at the University of Arizona has increased 76 percent since 2018, when it introduced a bachelor’s degree in applied humanities that connects the humanities with programs in business, engineering, medicine and other fields. It also hired a humanities recruitment director and marketing team and started training faculty members to enlist students in the major with the promise that an education in the humanities leads to jobs.\nThat’s an uncharacteristic role for humanities professors, who have tended to resist suggestions that it’s their role to ready students for the workforce.\nBut it’s become an existential one.\nNationwide, between 2012 and 2022 the number of undergraduate degrees awarded in the humanities — English, history, languages, literature, philosophy and related subjects — fell 24 percent, according to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. It’s now below 200,000 for the first time in more than two decades.\nRelated: Interested in more news about colleges and universities? Subscribe to our free biweekly higher education newsletter.\nIn response, universities and colleges nationwide have started eliminating humanities departments and laying off humanities faculty as policymakers, parents and administrators put a premium on highly specialized subjects they believe lead more directly to jobs.\nEfforts to revitalize humanities enrollment are widely scattered, however, with surprisingly few examples like Arizona’s, and no guarantee of widespread success.\n“What we are up against is the constant negative storytelling about how the humanities are useless,” said Alain-Philippe Durand, dean of the University of Arizona’s College of Humanities and a professor of French.\nHigher education has largely struggled to counteract this. Presidents and deans use vague arguments that the humanities impart knowledge and create citizens of the world, when what tuition-paying consumers want to know is what they’ll get for their money and how they’ll repay their student loan debt.\n“When you tell them we are teaching the life of the mind, they laugh at you,” Durand said over lunch at the student center.\n“You have people saying, ‘Do we really need this?’ ” he said. “It should be the opposite: ‘Hey, did you know that in the College of Humanities we teach some of the most in-demand skills in the job market?’ ”\nDurand’s department went so far as to put that declaration on a billboard on Interstate 10 in Phoenix, conveniently near the campus of rival Arizona State University. “Humanities=Jobs,” it said, with the college’s web address. Durand keeps a model of it on a shelf in his office.\nThe skills he’s talking about include how to communicate effectively, think critically, work in teams and be able to figure out a way to solve complex problems outside of a particular area of expertise. Employers say they want all of those but aren’t getting them from graduates who major in narrower fields.\nEight out of 10 executives and hiring managers say it’s very or somewhat important that students emerge from college with these kinds of skills, according to a survey by the American Association of Colleges and Universities. Yet half said, in a separate survey by the Business-Higher Education Forum, that graduates are showing up without them, and that the problem is getting worse.\nRelated: ‘Easy to just write us off’: Rural students’ choices shrink as colleges slash majors\nWhat employers want “is people who can make sense of the human experience,” said Rishi Jaitly, who has developed an executive education program at Virginia Polytechnic Institute that uses the humanities to help mid-career managers be better leaders.\nAlong with Arizona, Virginia Tech is among a small group of universities taking steps to change the conversation about the humanities. A surprising number are technology-focused.\nThese include the Georgia Institute of Technology, which has also started drawing a connection between the humanities and good jobs at high pay. That has helped boost undergraduate and graduate enrollment in Georgia Tech’s Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts by 58 percent since 2019, to 1,884 students in 2023 — the most recent period for which the figure is available.\nBefore then, “we were doing almost nothing to explain the value of the humanities,” said Richard Utz, interim dean. That’s important at a technological institute, he said. “So we started to connect each and every thing we do with the values that these kinds of skills have for [students’] career preparation.”\nA medievalist, Utz uses the example of assigning his students 15th-century Robin Hood ballads. “They read something that is entirely alien to them, that is in late medieval English, so they’re completely out of their comfort zone,” he said. Then they split into groups and consider the material from various perspectives. It makes them the kind of future workers “who are versatile enough to look at a situation from different points of view.”\nTo him, Utz said, “the future of the humanities is not being hermetically sealed off, as in, ‘You’re over there and we’re over here.’ It’s making clear that the skills of engineers and computer scientists increase if you include the arts, the humanities, the social sciences.”\nRelated: Apprenticeships are a trending alternative to college — but there’s a hitch\nThat’s also the idea behind a program in French for medical professionals at Washington University in St. Louis, which recruits students who took French in high school but may not have continued. For some, it leads to studying in Nice and interning at a hospital there, an unusual opportunity for undergraduates.\n“These students, when they come back to the United States, they are accepted in the best medical schools because their dossiers are at the top of the pile,” said Lionel Cuillé, a professor of French who spearheads the initiative. “Those pre-meds take French because it is a clear added value to their first major.”\nThe participants in the humanities-focused executive education program at Virginia Tech — in the first two years, they’ve come from Amazon, Microsoft, Boeing, Zillow and other companies — study history, philosophy, religion, classics, literature and the arts. They use these to consider questions about and qualities of leadership and see how what they learn can be applied to technology trends including data privacy and artificial intelligence.\n“What I was observing around me in Silicon Valley and more generally was a world that was missing that story,” said Virginia Tech’s Jaitly, a former technology entrepreneur and founder of a venture capital firm whose own undergraduate degree was in history. “The superpowers of the future emanate from the humanities: introspection and imagination, storytelling and story-listening, critical thinking.”\nHe purposely picked “leadership” instead of “humanities” for the name of the program, he said. “To me, ‘leadership’ is a high-impact word to show and not tell the power of the humanities.”\nWith a $1.",

      "raw_content": "History of Humanities\nHistory of Humanities is a double-blind peer-reviewed academic journal devoted to the history of the different traditions and disciplines in the humanities, across periods and cultures. Its current editors are Rens Bod, Julia Kursell, Jaap Maat, and Thijs Weststeijn.\nThe journal discusses the history of antiquarianism, archaeology, art history, classics, historiography, linguistics, literary studies, media studies, musicology, Oriental studies, philology, theater studies, and religious studies, as well as interactions between these disciplines and relevant developments in the sciences and social sciences. It publishes original research papers, thematic forums, review essays, and book reviews. It appears twice per year and is published by the University of Chicago Press like its counterpart devoted to the history of the (natural) sciences, Isis.\nTopic and agenda\n[edit]The journal was founded on the basis of the belief that, in contrast to the history of science, the various humanities disciplines had rarely been studied in an interconnected manner, which may partly have contributed to current sentiments of a \"crisis\" in the humanities.[1] In the first issue (2016), the editors state that:[2]\n“Our journal is meant to stand for the fact that scholarly practices of a type today labeled “humanities” have been an essential part of the process of knowledge making ever since human inquisitiveness sought to enhance our understanding of the world and ourselves. This long history has been studied in fruitful and illuminating ways, but the focus has been on either the natural sciences or on single disciplines within the humanities, such as history writing and linguistics. The fundamental contribution of the humanities to the intricate web of knowledge that scholars, thinkers, and researchers have spun in the course of several millennia has thus been poorly recognized and is consequently undervalued. We intend to redress the imbalance in the historiography of the search for knowledge that mankind has been engaged in for so long. A more balanced picture, we believe, will show that the ways we arrive at knowledge are complex, varied, and unpredictable and often involve the transmission of methods and insights from one field of investigation to another.\"\nThe journal is the brainchild of the Society for the History of the Humanities[3] which also organizes a series of conferences, “The Making of the Humanities,” in Amsterdam (2008, 2010, 2018), Rome (2012, 2014), Baltimore (2016), Oxford (2017), Cape Town (2019), Barcelona (2021), Pittsburgh (2022), and Lund (2024).[4] It has earlier published a trilogy, The Making of the Humanities (Amsterdam University Press), which tested the ground for the founding of the journal in 2016.[5][6][7]\nIndexing\n[edit]Articles that appear in History of Humanities are indexed in the following abstracting and indexing services:\n- Ulrich's Periodicals Directory\n- Ulrichsweb\n- EBSCOHOST\n- Humanities International Index\n- Humanities Source Ultimate\n- TOC Premier\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ \"How a New Field Could Help Save the Humanities\", The Chronicle Review of Higher Education, February 19, 2017 https://www.chronicle.com/article/How-a-New-Field-Could-Help/239209\n- ^ A New Field: History of Humanities.

      "raw_content": "Digital humanities\nDigital humanities (DH) is an area of scholarly activity at the intersection of computing or digital technologies and the disciplines of the humanities. It includes the systematic use of digital resources in the humanities, as well as the analysis of their application.[1][2] DH can be defined as new ways of doing scholarship that involve collaborative, transdisciplinary, and computationally engaged research, teaching, and publishing.[3] It brings digital tools and methods to the study of the humanities with the recognition that the printed word is no longer the main medium for knowledge production and distribution.[3]\nBy producing and using new applications and techniques, DH makes new kinds of teaching possible, while at the same time studying and critiquing how these impact cultural heritage and digital culture.[2] A distinctive feature of DH is its cultivation of a two-way relationship between the humanities and the digital: the field both employs technology in the pursuit of humanities research and subjects technology to humanistic questioning and interrogation.\nDefinition\n[edit]The definition of the digital humanities is being continually formulated by scholars and practitioners. Since the field is constantly growing and changing, specific definitions can quickly become outdated or unnecessarily limit future potential.[4] The second volume of Debates in the Digital Humanities (2016) acknowledges the difficulty in defining the field: \"Along with the digital archives, quantitative analyses, and tool-building projects that once characterized the field, DH now encompasses a wide range of methods and practices: visualizations of large image sets, 3D modeling of historical artifacts, 'born digital' dissertations, hashtag activism and the analysis thereof, alternate reality games, mobile makerspaces, and more. In what has been called 'big tent' DH, it can at times be difficult to determine with any specificity what, precisely, digital humanities work entails.\"[5]\nHistorically, the digital humanities developed out of humanities computing and has become associated with other fields, such as humanistic computing, social computing, and media studies. In concrete terms, the digital humanities embraces a variety of topics, from curating online collections of primary sources (primarily textual) to the data mining of large cultural data sets to topic modeling. Digital humanities incorporates both digitized (remediated) and born-digital materials and combines the methodologies from traditional humanities disciplines (such as rhetoric, history, philosophy, linguistics, literature, art, archaeology, music, and cultural studies) and social sciences,[6] with tools provided by computing (such as hypertext, hypermedia, data visualisation, information retrieval, data mining, statistics, text mining, digital mapping), and digital publishing. Related subfields of digital humanities have emerged like software studies, platform studies, and critical code studies. Fields that parallel the digital humanities include new media studies and information science as well as media theory of composition, game studies, particularly in areas related to digital humanities project design and production, and cultural analytics. Each disciplinary field and each country has its own unique history of digital humanities.[7]\nBerry and Fagerjord have suggested that a way to reconceptualise digital humanities could be through a \"digital humanities stack\". They argue that \"this type of diagram is common in computation and computer science to show how technologies are 'stacked' on top of each other in increasing levels of abstraction. Here, [they] use the method in a more illustrative and creative sense of showing the range of activities, practices, skills, technologies and structures that could be said to make up the digital humanities, with the aim of providing a high-level map.\"[8] Indeed, the \"diagram can be read as the bottom levels indicating some of the fundamental elements of the digital humanities stack, such as computational thinking and knowledge representation, and then other elements that later build on these.\"[9]\nIn practical terms, a major distinction within digital humanities is the focus on the data being processed. For processing textual data, digital humanities builds on a long and extensive history of digital edition, computational linguistics and natural language processing and developed an independent and highly specialized technology stack (largely cumulating in the specifications of the Text Encoding Initiative). This part of the field is sometimes thus set apart from Digital Humanities in general as 'digital philology' or 'computational philology'. For the creation and analysis of digital editions of objects or artifacts, digital philologists have access to digital practices, methods, and technologies such as optical character recognition that are providing opportunities to adapt the field to the digital age.[10]\nHistory\n[edit]Digital humanities descends from the field of humanities computing, whose origins reach back to 1940s and 50s, in the pioneering work of Jesuit scholar Roberto Busa, which began in 1946,[11] and of English professor Josephine Miles, beginning in the early 1950s.[12][13][14][15] In collaboration with IBM, Busa and his team created a computer-generated concordance to Thomas Aquinas' writings known as the Index Thomisticus.[3] Busa's works have been collected and translated by Julianne Nyhan and Marco Passarotti.[16] Other scholars began using mainframe computers to automate tasks like word-searching, sorting, and counting, which was much faster than processing information from texts with handwritten or typed index cards.[3] Similar first advances were made by Gerhard Sperl in Austria using computers by Zuse for Digital Assyriology.[17] In the decades which followed archaeologists, classicists, historians, literary scholars, and a broad array of humanities researchers in other disciplines applied emerging computational methods to transform humanities scholarship.[18][19]\nAs Tara McPherson has pointed out, the digital humanities also inherit practices and perspectives developed through many artistic and theoretical engagements with electronic screen culture beginning the late 1960s and 1970s. These range from research developed by organizations such as SIGGRAPH to creations by artists such as Charles and Ray Eames and the members of E.A.T. (Experiments in Art and Technology). The Eames and E.A.T. explored nascent computer culture and intermediality in creative works that dovetailed technological innovation with art.[20]\nThe first specialized journal in the digital humanities was Computers and the Humanities, which debuted in 1966. The Computer Applications and Quantitative Methods in Archaeology (CAA) association was founded in 1973. The Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing (ALLC) and the Association for Computers and the Humanities (ACH) were then founded in 1977 and 1978, respectively.[3]\nSoon, there was a need for a standardized protocol for tagging digital texts, and the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) was developed.[3] The TEI project was launched in 1987 and published the first full version of the TEI Guidelines in May 1994.[14] TEI helped shape the field of electronic textual scholarship and led to Extensible Markup Language (XML), which is a tag scheme for digital editing. Researchers also began experimenting with databases and hypertextual editing, which are structured around links and nodes, as opposed to the standard linear convention of print.[3] In the nineties, major digital text and image archives emerged at centers of humanities computing in the U.S. (e.g. the Women Writers Project, the Rossetti Archive,[21] and The William Blake Archive[22]), which demonstrated the sophistication and robustness of text-encoding for literature.",

      "raw_content": "Law\nLaw is a set of rules that are created and are enforceable by social or governmental institutions to regulate behavior,[1] with its precise definition a matter of longstanding debate.[2][3][4] It has been variously described as a science[5][6] and as the art of justice.[7][8][9] State-enforced laws can be made by a legislature, resulting in statutes; by the executive through decrees and regulations; or by judges' decisions, which form precedent in common law jurisdictions. An autocrat may exercise those functions within their realm. The creation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and also serves as a mediator of relations between people.\nLegal systems vary between jurisdictions, with their differences analysed in comparative law. In civil law jurisdictions, a legislature or other central body codifies and consolidates the law. In common law systems, judges may make binding case law through precedent,[10] although on occasion this may be overturned by a higher court or the legislature.[11] Religious law is in use in some religious communities and states, and has historically influenced secular law.[12][13][14][15][16]\nThe scope of law can be divided into two domains: public law concerns government and society, including constitutional law, administrative law, and criminal law; while private law deals with legal disputes between parties in areas such as contracts, property, torts, delicts and commercial law.[17] This distinction is stronger in civil law countries, particularly those with a separate system of administrative courts;[18][19] by contrast, the public-private law divide is less pronounced in common law jurisdictions.[20][21]\nLaw provides a source of scholarly inquiry into legal history,[22] philosophy,[23] economic analysis[24] and sociology.[25] Law also raises important and complex issues concerning equality, fairness, and justice.[26][27]\nEtymology\nThe word law, attested in Old English as lagu, comes from the Old Norse word lǫg. The singular form lag meant 'something laid or fixed' while its plural meant 'law'.[28]\nPhilosophy of law\nBut what, after all, is a law? [...] When I say that the object of laws is always general, I mean that law considers subjects en masse and actions in the abstract, and never a particular person or action. [...] On this view, we at once see that it can no longer be asked whose business it is to make laws, since they are acts of the general will; nor whether the prince is above the law, since he is a member of the State; nor whether the law can be unjust, since no one is unjust to himself; nor how we can be both free and subject to the laws, since they are but registers of our wills.\nThe philosophy of law is commonly known as jurisprudence. Normative jurisprudence asks \"what should law be?\", while analytic jurisprudence asks \"what is law?\"\nAnalytical jurisprudence\nThere have been several attempts to produce \"a universally acceptable definition of law\". In 1972, Baron Hampstead suggested that no such definition could be produced.[30] McCoubrey and White said that the question \"what is law?\" has no simple answer.[31] Glanville Williams said that the meaning of the word \"law\" depends on the context in which that word is used. He said that, for example, \"early customary law\" and \"municipal law\" were contexts where the word \"law\" had two different and irreconcilable meanings.[32] Thurman Arnold said that it is obvious that it is impossible to define the word \"law\" and that it is also equally obvious that the struggle to define that word should not ever be abandoned.[33] It is possible to take the view that there is no need to define the word \"law\" (e.g. \"let's forget about generalities and get down to cases\").[34]\nOne definition is that law is a system of rules and guidelines which are enforced through social institutions to govern behaviour.[1] In The Concept of Law, H. L. A. Hart argued that law is a \"system of rules\";[35] John Austin said law was \"the command of a sovereign, backed by the threat of a sanction\";[36] Ronald Dworkin describes law as an \"interpretive concept\" to achieve justice in his text titled Law's Empire;[37] and Joseph Raz argues law is an \"authority\" to mediate people's interests.[38] Oliver Wendell Holmes defined law as \"the prophecies of what the courts will do in fact, and nothing more pretentious.\"[39] In his Treatise on Law, Thomas Aquinas argues that law is a rational ordering of things, which concern the common good, that is promulgated by whoever is charged with the care of the community.[40] This definition has both positivist and naturalist elements.[41]\nConnection to morality and justice\nDefinitions of law often raise the question of the extent to which law incorporates morality.[42] John Austin's utilitarian answer was that law is \"commands, backed by threat of sanctions, from a sovereign, to whom people have a habit of obedience\".[36] Natural lawyers, on the other hand, such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, argue that law reflects essentially moral and unchangeable laws of nature. The concept of \"natural law\" emerged in ancient Greek philosophy concurrently and in connection with the notion of justice, and re-entered the mainstream of Western culture through the writings of Thomas Aquinas, notably his Treatise on Law.\nHugo Grotius, the founder of a purely rationalistic system of natural law, argued that law arises from both a social impulse—as Aristotle had indicated—and reason.[43] Immanuel Kant believed a moral imperative requires laws \"be chosen as though they should hold as universal laws of nature\".[44] Jeremy Bentham and his student Austin, following David Hume, believed that this conflated the \"is\" and what \"ought to be\" problem. Bentham and Austin argued for law's positivism; that real law is entirely separate from \"morality\".[45] Kant was also criticised by Friedrich Nietzsche, who rejected the principle of equality, and believed that law emanates from the will to power, and cannot be labeled as \"moral\" or \"immoral\".[46][47][48]\nIn 1934, the Austrian philosopher Hans Kelsen continued the positivist tradition in his book the Pure Theory of Law.[49] Kelsen believed that although law is separate from morality, it is endowed with \"normativity\", meaning we ought to obey it. While laws are positive \"is\" statements (e.g. the fine for reversing on a highway is €500); law tells us what we \"should\" do. Thus, each legal system can be hypothesised to have a 'basic norm' (German: Grundnorm) instructing us to obey. Kelsen's major opponent, Carl Schmitt, rejected both positivism and the idea of the rule of law because he did not accept the primacy of abstract normative principles over concrete political positions and decisions.[50] Therefore, Schmitt advocated a jurisprudence of the exception (state of emergency), which denied that legal norms could encompass all of the political experience.[51]\nLater in the 20th century, H. L. A. Hart attacked Austin for his simplifications and Kelsen for his fiction in The Concept of Law.[52] Hart argued law is a system of rules, divided into primary (rules of conduct) and secondary ones (rules addressed to officials to administer primary rules). Secondary rules are further divided into rules of adjudication (to resolve legal disputes), rules of change (allowing laws to be varied) and the rule of recognition (allowing laws to be identified as valid). Two of Hart's students continued the debate: In his book Law's Empire, Ronald Dworkin attacked Hart and the positivists for their refusal to treat law as a moral issue. Dworkin argues that law is an \"interpretive concept\"[37] that requires judges to find the best fitting and most just solution to a legal dispute, given their Anglo-American constitutional traditions.",

      "raw_content": "Law\nLaw is a set of rules decided by a particular place or authority meant for the purpose of keeping the peace and security of society.\nCourts or police may enforce this system of rules and punish people who break the laws, such as by paying a fine, or other penalty including jail. In ancient societies, laws were written by leaders, to set out rules on how people can live, work and do business with each other. In most countries today, laws are written and voted on by groups of politicians in a legislature, such as a parliament or congress, elected (chosen) by the governed peoples. Countries today have a constitution for the overall framework of society and make further laws as needed for matters of detail. Members of society generally have enough freedom within all the legal things they can choose to do. An activity is illegal if it breaks a law or does not follow the laws.\nA legal code is a written code of laws that are enforced. This may deal with things like police, courts, or punishments. A lawyer, jurist or attorney is a professional who studies and argues the rules of law. In the United States, there are two kinds of attorneys - \"transactional\" attorneys who write contracts and \"litigators\" who go to court. In the United Kingdom, these professionals are called solicitors and barristers respectively.\nThe Rule of Law is the law which says that government can only legally use its power in a way the government and the people agree on. It limits the powers a government has, as agreed in a country's constitution. The Rule of Law prevents dictatorship and protects the rights of the people. When leaders enforce the legal code honestly, even on themselves and their friends, this is an example of the rule of law being followed. \"The rule of law\", wrote the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle in 350 BC, \"is better than the rule of any individual.\"\nCulture is usually a major source of the principles behind many laws, and people also tend to trust the ideas based on family and social habits. In many countries throughout history, religion and religious books like the Vedas, Bible or the Koran have been a major source of law.\nTypes of law\n[change | change source]- Medical law is the body of laws concerning the rights and responsibilities of medical professionals and their patients. The main areas of focus for medical law include confidentiality, negligence and other torts related to medical treatment (especially medical malpractice), and criminal law and ethics.\n- Physician-Patient Privilege protects the patient's private conversations with a medical physician (doctor), this also extends to their personal information (like their contact details) shared with medical personnel.\n- Property law states the rights and obligations that a person has when they buy, sell, or rent homes and land (called real property or realty), and objects (called personal property).\n- Intellectual property law involves the rights people have over things they create, such as art, music, and literature. This is called copyright. It also protects inventions that people make, by a kind of law called patent. It also covers the rights people have to the names of a company or a distinctive mark or logo. This is called trademark.\n- Trust law (business Law) sets out the rules for money that is put into an investment, such as pension funds that people save up for their retirement. It involves many different types of law, including administrative and property law.\n- Tort law helps people to make claims for compensation (repayment) when someone hurts them or hurts their property.\n- Criminal law is used by the government to prevent people from breaking laws, and punish people who do break them.\n- Constitutional law deals with the important rights of the government, and its relationship with the people. It mainly involves the interpretation of a constitution, including things like the Separation of powers of the different branches of government.\n- A court order is an official proclamation by a judge that defines and authorizes the carrying out of certain steps for one or more parties to a case.\n- Administrative law is used by ordinary citizens who want to challenge decisions made by governments. It also involves things like regulations, and the operation of the administrative agencies.\n- International law is used to set out rules on how countries can act in areas such as trade, the environment, or military action. The Geneva Conventions on the conduct of war and the Roerich Pact are examples of international law.\n- Custom and tradition are practices that are widely adopted and agreed upon in a society, thought often not in a written form. Custom and tradition can be enforced in courts and are sometimes considered as part of the legal reasoning in matters decided in courts. In some societies and cultures all law is or was custom and tradition. This is increasingly rare although there are some parts of the world where custom tradition are still binding or even the predominant form of law, for example tribal lands or failed states.\nCivil law and common law\n[change | change source]Civil law is the legal system used in most countries around the world today. Civil law is based on legislation that is found in constitutions or statutes passed by government. The secondary part of civil law is the legal approaches that are part of custom. In civil law governments, judges do not generally have much power, and most of the laws and legal precedent are created by Members of Parliament.\nCommon law is based on the decisions made by judges in past court cases. It comes from England and it became part of almost every country that once belonged to the British Empire, except Malta, Scotland, the U.S. state of Louisiana, and the Canadian province of Quebec. It is also the predominant form of law in the United States, where many laws called statutes are written by Congress, but many more legal rules exist from the decisions of the courts. Common law had its beginnings in the Middle Ages, when King John was forced by his barons to sign a document called Magna Carta.\nReligious law\n[change | change source]Religious law is law based on religious beliefs or books. Examples include the Jewish Halakha, Islamic Sharia, and Christian Canon law.\nUntil the 1700s, Sharia law was the main legal system throughout the Muslim world. In some Muslim countries such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, the whole legal systems still base their law on Sharia law. Islamic law is often criticised because it has harsh penalties for crimes. A serious criticism is the judgement of the European Court that \"sharia is incompatible with the fundamental principles of democracy\".[1][2][3]\nThe Turkish Refah Party's sharia-based \"plurality of legal systems, grounded on religion\" was ruled to contravene the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The Court decided Refah's plan would \"do away with the State's role as the guarantor of individual rights and freedoms\" and \"infringe the principle of non-discrimination between individuals as regards their enjoyment of public freedoms, which is one of the fundamental principles of democracy\".[1]\nHistory of law\n[change | change source]The history of law is closely connected to the development of human civilizations. Ancient Egyptian law developed in 3000 BC. In 1760 BC King Hammurabi, took ancient Babylonian law and organized it, and had it chiselled in stone for the public to see in the marketplace. These laws became known as the Code of Hammurabi.\nThe Torah from the Old Testament is an old body of law. It was written around 1280 BC. It has moral rules such as the Ten Commandments, which tell people what things are not permitted. Sometimes people try to change the law. For example, if prostitution is illegal, they try to make it legal.",

      "raw_content": "Portal topics - (Random portal)\nLaw is a set of rules that are created and are enforceable by social or governmental institutions to regulate behavior, with its precise definition a matter of longstanding debate. It has been variously described as a science and as the art of justice. State-enforced laws can be made by a legislature, resulting in statutes; by the executive through decrees and regulations; or by judges' decisions, which form precedent in common law jurisdictions. An autocrat may exercise those functions within their realm. The creation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and also serves as a mediator of relations between people.\nLegal systems vary between jurisdictions, with their differences analysed in comparative law. In civil law jurisdictions, a legislature or other central body codifies and consolidates the law. In common law systems, judges may make binding case law through precedent, although on occasion this may be overturned by a higher court or the legislature. Religious law is in use in some religious communities and states, and has historically influenced secular law.\nThe scope of law can be divided into two domains: public law concerns government and society, including constitutional law, administrative law, and criminal law; while private law deals with legal disputes between parties in areas such as contracts, property, torts, delicts and commercial law. This distinction is stronger in civil law countries, particularly those with a separate system of administrative courts; by contrast, the public-private law divide is less pronounced in common law jurisdictions.

Computer crime can be broadly defined as criminal activity involving information technology infrastructure, including illegal access (unauthorized access), illegal interception (by technical means of non-public transmissions of computer data to, from or within a computer system), data interference (unauthorized damaging, deletion, deterioration, alteration or suppression of computer data), systems interference (interfering with the functioning of a computer system by inputting, transmitting, damaging, deleting, deteriorating, altering or suppressing computer data), misuse of devices, forgery (or identity theft) and electronic fraud.Convictions of computer crimes, or hacking, began as early as 1984 with the case of The 414s from the 414 area code in Milwaukee. In that case, six teenagers broke into a number of high-profile computer systems, including Los Alamos National Laboratory, Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Security Pacific Bank. On May 1, 1984, one of the 414s, Gerald Wondra, was sentenced to two years of probation. In May 1986, the first computer trespass conviction to result in a jail sentence was handed down to Michael Princeton Wilkerson, who received two weeks in jail for his infiltration of Microsoft, Sundstrand Corp., Kenworth Truck Co. and Resources Conservation Co.

After studying at Christ's College, Cambridge, Fuller became a barrister of Gray's Inn. His legal career there began prosperously—he was employed by the Privy Council to examine witnesses—but was hampered later by his representation of the Puritans, a religious tendency which did not conform with the established Church of England. Fuller was repeatedly in contention with the ecclesiastical courts, including the Star Chamber and Court of High Commission, and was once expelled for the zeal with which he defended his client. In 1593 he was returned as the Member of Parliament for St Mawes, where he campaigned against the extension of recusancy laws. Outside of Parliament, he successfully brought a patents case which not only undermined the right of the Crown to issue patents but accurately predicted the attitude taken by the Statute of Monopolies two decades later.\nReturned to Parliament in 1604 for the City of London, Fuller became considered the \"leader of the opposition\" due to his conflict with the government over policy, fighting the impositions on currants, the patent on blue starch, and opposing the proposed union with Scotland on legal and economic grounds. In 1607, in what became known as Fuller's Case, he again began challenging the Court of High Commission, and eventually got the Court of Common Pleas under Sir Edward Coke to agree that the common law courts had the power to free imprisoned ecclesiastical prisoners. These encounters with the ecclesiastical courts were described as \"bruising\", but by 1610 he was considered an \"elder statesman\", introducing bills on ecclesiastical reform and the statutory management of customs duties. He continued to sit in Parliament until his death on 23 February 1620. (Full article...)\nA statute is a formal written enactment of a legislative body, a stage in the process of legislation. Typically, statutes command or prohibit something, or declare policy. Statutes are laws made by legislative bodies; they are distinguished from case law or precedent, which is decided by courts, regulations issued by government agencies, and oral or customary law.[better source needed] Statutes may originate with the legislative body of a country, state or province, county, or municipality. (Full article...)\nThe Laws of the Twelve Tables (Latin: lex duodecim tabularum) was the legislation that stood at the foundation of Roman law. Formally promulgated in 449 BC, the Tables consolidated earlier traditions into an enduring set of laws.\nIn the Forum, \"The Twelve Tables\" stated the rights and duties of the Roman citizen. Their formulation was the result of considerable agitation by the plebeian class, who had hitherto been excluded from the higher benefits of the Republic. The law had previously been unwritten and exclusively interpreted by upper-class priests, the pontifices. Something of the regard with which later Romans came to view the Twelve Tables is captured in the remark of Cicero (106–43 BC) that the \"Twelve Tables...seems to me, assuredly to surpass the libraries of all the philosophers, both in weight of authority, and in plenitude of utility\". Cicero scarcely exaggerated; the Twelve Tables formed the basis of Roman law for a thousand years.\nThe Twelve Tables are sufficiently comprehensive that their substance has been described as a 'code', although modern scholars consider this characterization exaggerated. The Tables are a sequence of definitions of various private rights and procedures. They generally took for granted such things as the institutions of the family and various rituals for formal transactions. The provisions were often highly specific and diverse. (Full article...)\nCase law, also used interchangeably with common law, is a law that is based on precedents, that is the judicial decisions from previous cases, rather than law based on constitutions, statutes, or regulations. Case law uses the detailed facts of a legal case that have been resolved by courts or similar tribunals. These past decisions are called \"case law\", or precedent. Stare decisis—a Latin phrase meaning \"let the decision stand\"—is the principle by which judges are bound to such past decisions, drawing on established judicial authority to formulate their positions.

      "raw_content": "Rule of law\nThe rule of law is a political and legal ideal that all people and institutions within a country, state, or community are accountable to the same laws, including lawmakers, government officials, and judges.[2][3][4] It is sometimes stated simply as \"no one is above the law\" or \"all are equal before the law\". According to Encyclopædia Britannica, it is defined as \"the mechanism, process, institution, practice, or norm that supports the equality of all citizens before the law, secures a nonarbitrary form of government, and more generally prevents the arbitrary use of power.\"[5]\nUse of the phrase can be traced to 16th-century Britain. In the following century, Scottish theologian Samuel Rutherford employed it in arguing against the divine right of kings.[6] John Locke wrote that freedom in society means being subject only to laws written by a legislature that apply to everyone, with a person being otherwise free from both governmental and private restrictions of liberty. The phrase \"rule of law\" was further popularized in the 19th century by British jurist A. V. Dicey. However, the principle, if not the phrase itself, was recognized by ancient thinkers. Aristotle wrote: \"It is more proper that law should govern than any one of the citizens.\"\nThe term rule of law is closely related to constitutionalism as well as Rechtsstaat. It refers to a political situation, not to any specific legal rule.[7][8][9] Distinct is the rule of man, where one person or group of persons rule arbitrarily.[10]\nHistory\n[edit]Although credit for popularizing the expression \"the rule of law\" in modern times is usually given to A. V. Dicey,[11][12] development of the legal concept can be traced through history to many ancient civilizations, including ancient Greece, Mesopotamia, India, and Rome.[13]\nEarly history (to 15th century)\n[edit]The earliest conception of rule of law can be traced back to the Indian epics Ramayana and Mahabharata - the earliest versions of which date around to 8th or 9th centuries BC.[14][15][16] The Mahabharata deals with the concepts of Dharma (used to mean law and duty interchangeably), Rajdharma (duty of the king) and Dharmaraja. It states in one of its slokas that,\"The people should execute a king who does not protect them, but deprives them of their property and assets and who takes no advice or guidance from any one. Such a king is not a king but misfortune.\"[17][18]\nOther sources for the philosophy of rule of law can be traced to the Upanishads which state that, \"The law is the king of the kings. No one is higher than the law. Not even the king.\" Other commentaries include Kautilya's Arthashastra (4th-century BC), Manusmriti (dated to the 1st to 3rd century CE), Yajnavalkya-Smriti (dated between the 3rd and 5th century CE), Brihaspati Smriti (dated between 15 CE and 16 CE).[19][20]\nAncient Greece\n[edit]Several scholars have also traced the concept of the rule of law back to 4th-century BC Athens, seeing it either as the dominant value of the Athenian democracy,[21] or as one held in conjunction with the concept of popular sovereignty.[22] However, these arguments have been challenged and the present consensus is that upholding an abstract concept of the rule of law was not \"the predominant consideration\" of the Athenian legal system.[23] Aristotle, in his Politics, wrote: \"It is more proper that law should govern than any one of the citizens: upon the same principle, if it is advantageous to place the supreme power in some particular persons, they should be appointed to be only guardians, and the servants of the laws.\"[24]\nThe idea of the rule of law can be regarded as a modern iteration of the ideas of ancient Greek philosophers, who argued that the best form of government was rule by the best men.[25] Plato advocated a benevolent monarchy ruled by an idealized philosopher king, who was above the law.[25] Plato nevertheless hoped that the best men would be good at respecting established laws, explaining that \"Where the law is subject to some other authority and has none of its own, the collapse of the state, in my view, is not far off; but if law is the master of the government and the government is its slave, then the situation is full of promise and men enjoy all the blessings that the gods shower on a state.\"[26] In contrast, Aristotle flatly opposed letting the highest officials wield power beyond guarding and serving the laws.[25] In other words, Aristotle advocated the rule of law:\nIt is more proper that law should govern than any one of the citizens: upon the same principle, if it is advantageous to place the supreme power in some particular persons, they should be appointed to be only guardians, and the servants of the laws.[24]\nThe Roman statesman Cicero is often cited as saying, roughly: \"We are all servants of the laws in order to be free.\"[27] During the Roman Republic, controversial magistrates might be put on trial when their terms of office expired. Under the Roman Empire, the sovereign was personally immune (legibus solutus), but those with grievances could sue the treasury.[11]\nChina\n[edit]In China, members of the school of legalism during the 3rd century BC argued for using law as a tool of governance, but they promoted \"rule by law\" as opposed to \"rule of law,\" meaning that they placed the aristocrats and emperor above the law.[28] In contrast, the Huang–Lao school of Daoism rejected legal positivism in favor of a natural law that even the ruler would be subject to.[29]\nThe ancient concept of rule of law can be distinguished from rule by law, according to political science professor Li Shuguang: \"The difference ... is that, under the rule of law, the law is preeminent and can serve as a check against the abuse of power. Under rule by law, the law is a mere tool for a government, that suppresses in a legalistic fashion.\"[30]\nEngland\n[edit]Alfred the Great, Anglo-Saxon king in the 9th century, reformed the law of his kingdom and assembled a law code (the Doom Book) which he grounded on biblical commandments. He held that the same law had to be applied to all persons, whether rich or poor, friends or enemies. This was likely inspired by Leviticus 19:15: \"You shall do no iniquity in judgment. You shall not favor the wretched and you shall not defer to the rich. In righteousness you are to judge your fellow.\"[31][better source needed]\nIn 1215, Archbishop Stephen Langton gathered the Barons in England and restricted the powers of King John and future sovereigns and magistrates under the rule of law, preserving ancient liberties by Magna Carta in return for exacting taxes.[32][33] The influence of Magna Carta ebbed and waned across centuries. The weakening of royal power it demonstrated was based more upon the instability presented by contested claims than thoughtful adherence to constitutional principles. Until 1534, the Church excommunicated people for violations, but after a time Magna Carta was simply replaced by other statutes considered binding upon the king to act according to \"process of the law\". Magna Carta's influence is considered greatly diminished by the reign of Henry VI, after the Wars of the Roses.[34] The ideas contained in Magna Carta are widely considered to have influenced the United States Constitution.[35]\nThe first known use of this English phrase occurred around 1500.[36] Another early example of the phrase \"rule of law\" is found in a petition to James I of England in 1610, from the House of Commons:\nAmongst many other points of happiness and freedom which your majesty's subjects of this kingdom have enjoyed under your royal progenitors, kings and queens of this realm, there is none which they have accounted more dear and precious than this, to be guided and governed by the certain rule of the law which giveth both to the head and members that which of right belongeth to them, and not by any uncertain or arbitrary form of government ...",

      "raw_content": "Management\nManagement (or managing) is the administration of organizations, whether businesses, nonprofit organizations, or a government bodies through business administration, nonprofit management, or the political science sub-field of public administration respectively. It is the process of managing the resources of businesses, governments, and other organizations.\nLarger organizations generally have three hierarchical levels of managers,[1][need quotation to verify] organized in a pyramid structure:\n- Senior management roles include the board of directors and a chief executive officer (CEO) or a president of an organization. They set the strategic goals and policy of the organization and make decisions on how the overall organization will operate. Senior managers are generally executive-level professionals who provide direction to middle management. Compare governance.\n- Middle management roles include branch managers, regional managers, department managers, and section managers. They provide direction to front-line managers and communicate the strategic goals and policies of senior management to them.\n- Line management roles include supervisors and the front-line team leaders, who oversee the work of regular employees, or volunteers in some voluntary organizations, and provide direction on their work. Line managers often perform the managerial functions that are traditionally considered the core of management. Despite the name, they are usually considered part of the workforce and not part of the organization's management class.\nManagement is taught - both as a theoretical subject as well as its a practical application - across different disciplines at colleges and universities. Prominent major degree-programs in management include Management, Business Administration and Public Administration. Social scientists study management as an academic discipline, investigating areas such as social organization, organizational adaptation, and organizational leadership.[2] In recent decades, there has been a movement for evidence-based management.[3]\nEtymology\n[edit]The English verb manage has its roots in the fifteenth-century French verb mesnager, which often referred in equestrian language \"to hold in hand the reins of a horse\".[4] Also the Italian term maneggiare (to handle, especially tools or a horse) is possible. In Spanish, manejar can also mean to rule the horses.[5] These three terms derive from the two Latin words manus (hand) and agere (to act).\nThe French word for housekeeping, ménagerie, derived from ménager (\"to keep house\"; compare ménage for \"household\"), also encompasses taking care of domestic animals. Ménagerie is the French translation of Xenophon's famous book Oeconomicus[6] (Ancient Greek: Οἰκονομικός) on household matters and husbandry. The French word mesnagement (or ménagement) influenced the semantic development of the English word management in the 17th and 18th centuries.[7]\nDefinitions\n[edit]Views on the definition and scope of management include:\n- Henri Fayol (1841–1925) stated: \"To manage is to forecast and to plan, to organize, to command, to co-ordinate and to control\".[8]\n- Fredmund Malik (1944– ) defines management as \"the transformation of resources into utility\".[9]\n- Management is included[by whom?] as one of the factors of production – along with machines, materials and money.\n- Ghislain Deslandes defines management as \"a vulnerable force, under pressure to achieve results and endowed with the triple power of constraint, imitation, and imagination, operating on subjective, interpersonal, institutional and environmental levels\".[10]\n- Peter Drucker (1909–2005) saw the basic task of management as twofold: marketing and innovation. Nevertheless, innovation is also linked to marketing (product innovation is a central strategic marketing issue).[citation needed] Drucker identifies marketing as a key essence for business success, but management and marketing are generally understood[by whom?] as two different branches of business administration knowledge.\nTheoretical scope\n[edit]Management involves identifying the mission, objective, procedures, rules and manipulation[11] of the human capital of an enterprise to contribute to the success of the enterprise.[12] Scholars have focused on the management of individual,[13] organizational,[14] and inter-organizational relationships. This implies effective communication: an enterprise environment (as opposed to a physical or mechanical mechanism) implies human motivation and implies some sort of successful progress or system outcome.[15] As such, management is not the manipulation of a mechanism (machine or automated program), not the herding of animals, and can occur either in a legal or in an illegal enterprise or environment. From an individual's perspective, management does not need to be seen solely from an enterprise point of view, because management is an essential[quantify] function in improving one's life and relationships.[16] Management is therefore everywhere[17] and it has a wider range of application.[clarification needed] Communication and a positive endeavor are two main aspects of it either through enterprise or through independent pursuit.[citation needed] Plans, measurements, motivational psychological tools, goals, and economic measures (profit, etc.) may or may not be necessary components for there to be management. At first, one views management functionally, such as measuring quantity, adjusting plans, and meeting goals,[citation needed] but this applies even in situations where planning does not take place. From this perspective, Henri Fayol (1841–1925)[18][page needed] considers management to consist of five functions:\n- planning (forecasting)\n- organizing\n- commanding\n- coordinating\n- controlling\nIn another way of thinking, Mary Parker Follett (1868–1933), allegedly defined management as \"the art of getting things done through people\".[19] She described management as a philosophy.[20][need quotation to verify]\nCritics,[which?] however, find this definition useful but far too narrow. The phrase \"management is what managers do\" occurs widely,[21] suggesting the difficulty of defining management without circularity, the shifting nature of definitions[citation needed] and the connection of managerial practices with the existence of a managerial cadre or of a class.\nOne habit of thought regards management as equivalent to \"business administration\" and thus excludes management in places outside commerce, for example in charities and in the public sector. More broadly, every organization must \"manage\" its work, people, processes, technology, etc. to maximize effectiveness.[citation needed] Nonetheless, many people refer to university departments that teach management as \"business schools\". Some such institutions (such as the Harvard Business School) use that name, while others (such as the Yale School of Management) employ the broader term \"management\".\nEnglish speakers may also use the term \"management\" or \"the management\" as a collective word describing the managers of an organization, for example of a corporation.[22] Historically this use of the term often contrasted with the term labor – referring to those being managed.[23]\nLevels\n[edit]A common management structure of organizations includes three management levels: low-level, middle-level, and top-level managers. Low-level managers manage the work of non-managerial individuals who are directly involved with the production or creation of the organization's products. Low-level managers are often called supervisors, but may also be called line managers, office managers, or even foremen. Middle managers include all levels of management between the low level and the top level of the organization. These managers manage the work of low-level managers and may have titles such as department head, project leader, plant manager, or division manager.",

      "raw_content": "Learn what managers do within organizations and discover different management styles, career opportunities, and more.\nManagement is how businesses organize and direct workflow, operations, and employees to meet company goals. The primary goal of management is to create an environment that empowers employees to work efficiently and productively. A solid organizational structure guides employees and establishes the tone and focus of their work.\nLearn more about management, key skills you'll need to be successful in this area, and careers you can pursue if you're interested in managing a team of people. Afterward, if you'd like to build your management skills, consider enrolling in the University of Illinois' Strategic Leadership and Management Specialization, where you'll learn the fundamentals of effectively leading people.\nManagement is an important business function that involves overseeing people or projects and guiding them toward a common goal or outcome.\nManagers are tasked with several responsibilities to ensure the success of the team or initiative they're overseeing. This can look like:\nCreating goals and objectives\nEstablishing schedules\nDeveloping strategies to increase performance, productivity, and efficiency\nEnsuring compliance with company policies and industry regulations\nMentoring employees\nMonitoring budgets, productivity levels, and performance\nResolving customer problems\nTraining staff\nManagers have several functions within an organization. You'll usually see these functions divided into four interconnected groups. Understanding them can help you identify your strengths and areas of need so that you can choose the proper training to improve your skills.\nThe first function of a manager is to set goals. These goals may be for individual employees, departments, or the entire organization, depending on the manager's level of responsibility. In addition to setting goals, managers often develop action items along with strategies and resources to complete tasks and meet goals.\nMeeting organizational goals requires putting the right people in the right places. Managers can play an important role in choosing workers for positions and projects. Knowing how to group people and help them build relationships often significantly affects how well the group works together. Sometimes managers need to train employees for specific tasks to ensure they have the knowledge and skills they need to succeed.\nManagers help motivate employees to show up and stay productive. This includes sharing a common vision, encouraging them to develop their strengths, and inspiring them to do their best work at all times. Having effective communication skills is essential for filling this role.\nManagers typically spend time measuring the success of their teams and how well they meet goals. The more they understand what works and doesn't work, the better prepared they are to make decisions in the future. Managers must understand and adjust strategies to meet company goals.\nWatch this video on the process of performance management, an important part of helping employees reach their potential:\nRead more: What Is Management Science? + How to Enter This Field\nThe way you choose to manage your team or department can have a direct effect on how they meet their goals. What you say and do may send powerful messages to employees about how you value their contributions and your level of trust in them. The list below highlights some of the more common styles used by managers.\nAuthoritative leaders tend to make decisions without feedback from others. This approach works well when you need to respond quickly to a situation and don't have time for debate. If you rely on this approach too much, you may see high levels of turnover within the organization and stalled innovation.\nSome managers view their role as that of a coach who sees the potential in employees and wants to help them grow. This can effectively build strong teams and create an environment where employees feel comfortable experimenting. Employees typically have a sense of autonomy under this style, but those needing more direction may feel neglected.\nDemocratic managers value the input of employees in the decision-making process and usually believe having more ideas is better than having a few. This management style may help empower and motivate employees to work toward common goals. However, sorting through all of the voices and finding a consensus to make a decision can take time.\nIn a transformational management style, managers prioritize innovation and growth. These managers encourage employees to discover just what they're capable of achieving. Workers with transformational leaders tend to be happy and dedicated to their work, but they must be able to adapt to sudden changes.\nA visionary leader knows how to ensure every team member understands the company's vision and is working toward a common goal. These leaders tend to be excellent communicators and typically give workers plenty of autonomy as long as they effectively execute the vision.\nIn many organizations, management falls into one of three levels: top, middle, and low. Managers in smaller companies may fill roles at more than one level, while larger organizations may have several managers within each level.\nTop: Top-level management typically has an administrative role, and their decisions affect the entire organization even though they sometimes aren’t involved in the day-to-day operations. They may have the title of chief executive officer (CEO) or serve on the board of directors.\nMiddle: You find people with executive roles at the middle management level. They work with both top-level management and supervisors to help workers meet objectives and boost the company's productivity. At this level, they may be called regional managers or general managers.\nLow: The final level of management often has a supervisory role. These managers have titles like shift supervisor, branch manager, or team leader. They work with individuals and teams to meet goals determined by upper management. They typically have less influence over company policy compared to the other management levels, but the most interaction with direct reports.\nRead more: 11 Key Project Management Skills\nManagers work in almost every type of company and industry.

      "raw_content": "Management style\nManagement consists of the planning, prioritizing, and organizing work efforts to accomplish objectives within a business organization.[1] A management style is the particular way managers go about accomplishing these objectives. It encompasses the way they make decisions, how they plan and organize work, and how they exercise authority.[2]\nManagement styles varies by company, level of management, and even from person to person. A good manager is one that can adjust their management style to suit different environments and employees. An individual’s management style is shaped by many different factors including internal and external business environments, and how one views the role of work in the lives of employees.[1]\nFactors that shape the management style\n[edit]Internal factors\n[edit]Internal company factors that determine a management style include, but are not limited to, policies, priorities, corporate culture, staff skill levels, motivation and management structures.[1][2]\nIn order to be effective, a manager’s style and outlook must fit into the business's organizational culture. Their style must adhere to the policies and procedures set forth by the organization, and they must be able to achieve company objectives. They are responsible for controlling an effective work team and must uphold organizational beliefs within that team. A manager who cannot do this would likely be deemed ineffective and be removed from the position.[2]\nStaff skill levels and motivation greatly affect management styles as it is necessary for a manager to accomplish objectives while maintaining a content and effective work team. Less skilled or motivated employees would require a style that is more controlling and fosters consistent supervision to ensure productivity. Highly motivated or skilled employees require less supervision and direction as they are typically more technically skilled than management and have the ability, and desire, to make more autonomous decisions. These employees would benefit from a management style that is less controlling or hands-off.[1]\nHierarchical management structures call for decision to be made solely by upper management, and within the scope of a manager’s position in the hierarchy. These types of organizations require more controlling management styles in order to meet objectives and get things done as specified. Flatter structures with more decentralized decision-making benefit from management styles that encourage team communication and employee’s contribution with regard to decision-making.\nExternal factors\n[edit]External factors affecting management styles are those that are outside of the control of the organization. These include, but are not limited to consumers, suppliers, competitors, the economy, and the law.[1]\nSome examples of these factors are a competitor who offers a more autonomous environment for skilled employees and control the job pool; the economy for a specific manufactured good results in a spike in demand causing a production crisis; the laws for a specific industry change and require employees who have extensive knowledge and certification causing the company employees talent and motivation to change.\nTheory X and Theory Y\n[edit]Douglas McGregor introduced Theory X and Theory Y in 1957.[3] This psychological concept proposed that how one viewed human relationships to those of an enterprise determined their style of management.\nTheory X proposes that people inherently lack the motivation and desire for responsibility and need to be closely supervised, directed, and tightly controlled in order to achieve team objectives.[3] Without it, workers may become unwilling to work. This is considered the more conventional theory and results in management styles that have high degrees of control over employees.\nTheory Y conversely suggests that it is human nature to be motivated by objectives and gain satisfaction through the completion of work.[2] Those who believe in Theory Y believe that it is the responsibility of management to foster environments where employees can develop potential and utilize their skills to achieve objectives.[3] This perspective leads to management styles that give the workers more decision making control and provide less supervision.\nTypes of management styles\n[edit]All management styles can be categorized by three major types: Autocratic, Democratic, and Laissez-Faire, with Autocratic being the most controlling and Laissez-Faire being the least controlling.[citation needed]\nAutocratic management is the most controlling of the management styles. Variations of this style are authoritative, persuasive, and paternalistic. Autocratic managers make all of the decisions in the workplace. Communication with this type of management is one way, top-down to the employees. Employee ideas and contributions are not encouraged or considered necessary.[4] Roles and tasks are clearly defined, and workers are expected to follow these directions without question while being consistently checked and supervised.[1]\nThis type of style is particularly useful in organizations with hierarchical structures where management makes all of the decisions based on positioning in the hierarchy. Employees that benefit from this style of management include those who are new, unskilled, or unmotivated, as they need the supervision and clear direction. Managers can benefit greatly from using this style in times of crisis or serious time constraints.[5]\nThe advantages of the autocratic management style are little uncertainty, clearly defined roles and expectations for employees, and the speed of decision-making.[1] All decisions are made by the manager and employees are expected to be compliant leaving little room for variation or confusion. Decision-making speed is ideal and is not slowed by conflicting thought or agendas.\nDisadvantages include lack of staff input with ideas that are not encouraged or shared. This can lead to job dissatisfaction, absenteeism, and employee turnover. Because managers make all of the decisions, the employees are not inclined to act autonomously and may become too dependent on the manager. Not all employees want or need supervision, and as a result can become resentful and unhappy.[5] Too many dissatisfied employees and the separation of power with an autocratic management style can lead to an ‘us vs them’ mentality.[1]\nAuthoritative style\n[edit]With this management style, there is little trust or confidence in employees. This manager dictates orders to employees and expects that they do exactly as required. These employees are unskilled. This requires constant teaching and coaching of the staff as well as consistent supervision.[2][5]\nPersuasive style\n[edit]Using this management style, the manager still makes all decisions for employees but then convinces employees that these decisions were made in the best interest of the team. The only real difference here is that it can establish a higher level of trust between management and staff.[1]\nPaternalistic or Exploitative/Authoritative style\n[edit]The manager still makes all of the decisions in this style of management and treats the employees in a condescending or paternalistic way.[2] The decisions are made in the best interest of the employees and the manager explains these decisions and the importance of them to the employees. These employees may feel well taken care of and looked after by the paternalistic manager but may become resentful of not being taken seriously. This style breeds highly dependent employees.[6]\nDemocratic\n[edit]The democratic management style involves managers reaching decisions with the input of the employees but being responsible for making the final decision.[4] There are many variations of this style of management including consultative, participative, and collaborative styles. Employee ideas and contributions are encouraged, but not necessary.",

One day he sees Sue, who is staying at the motel for the weekend. Mike develops a crush on her and surprises her at her door with a bottle of wine. Sue doesn't quite know what to make of his approach, shares some wine to be polite, then asks him to leave. Mike returns the next day, trying the same trick with champagne, and this time she allows him to touch her butt momentarily. As Sue heads back home the next day she decides to go back and have sex with Mike in the laundry room.\nMike realizes his feelings for Sue and flies to her home in Baltimore. She's shocked to see him there, but out of courtesy allows him to stay with her until morning when he can go back home.

He decides to make a change in his life and go after her once again.\nMike learns that Sue has gotten back together with her old boyfriend Jango, a former punk rocker turned successful businessman in Aberdeen, WA. Mike settles into the new town by taking a job at a Chinese restaurant. The son of the owners Al befriends him and allows him to stay in the restaurant's basement.\nMike skydives into Sue and Jango's pool to surprise her, but Jango responds by attacking him with an airsoft gun. Feeling bad about what he did, Jango invites Mike and Al over for dinner. Jango knows he has feelings towards Sue and threatens him. Regardless of the threat, Mike, with help from Al, serenades her with a song later that night.\nSue meets up with Mike the next day, informing him, that she and Jango are getting married. Sue is pregnant, and she wants to be with someone that's in control of his life. In anger after everything he worked for to be with her, Mike tells her to leave.\nAfter spending four months in a Buddhist monastery, Mike returns to the motel, now being run solely by his father (Fred Ward). After talking about moving on with their lives, Mike's father hands him the deed to the motel. He decides to turn the motel into a homeless shelter, something Sue had mentioned always wanting to do. Mike calls her at home to tell her, but Jango answers the phone. He reveals that Sue has left him and is living with her mother.\nMike makes his way to Sue's in Maryland to ask her for help with the shelter. She's happy to see him and tells him that she had messed up their relationship. Mike tells her he loves her and only wants to take care of her and her baby.

      "raw_content": "Medicine\nMedicine is the science[1] and practice[2] of caring for patients, managing the diagnosis, prognosis, prevention, treatment, palliation of their injury or disease, and promoting their health. Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others.[3]\nMedicine has been practiced since prehistoric times, and for most of this time it was an art (an area of creativity and skill), frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture. For example, a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing, or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism. In recent centuries, since the advent of modern science, most medicine has become a combination of art and science (both basic and applied, under the umbrella of medical science). For example, while stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice, knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science.\nPrescientific forms of medicine, now known as traditional medicine or folk medicine, remain commonly used in the absence of scientific medicine and are thus called alternative medicine. Alternative treatments outside of scientific medicine with ethical, safety and efficacy concerns are termed quackery.\nEtymology\n[edit]Medicine (UK: /ˈmɛdsɪn/ ⓘ, US: /ˈmɛdɪsɪn/ ⓘ) is the science and practice of the diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and prevention of disease.[4][5] The word \"medicine\" is derived from Latin medicus, meaning \"a physician\".[a][7] The word \"physic\" itself, from which \"physician\" derives, was the old word for what is now called a medicine, and also the field of medicine.[8]\nClinical practice\n[edit]Medical availability and clinical practice vary across the world due to regional differences in culture and technology. Modern scientific medicine is highly developed in the Western world, while in developing countries such as parts of Africa or Asia, the population may rely more heavily on traditional medicine with limited evidence and efficacy and no required formal training for practitioners.[9]\nIn the developed world, evidence-based medicine is not universally used in clinical practice; for example, a 2007 survey of literature reviews found that about 49% of the interventions lacked sufficient evidence to support either benefit or harm.[10]\nIn modern clinical practice, physicians and physician assistants personally assess patients to diagnose, prognose, treat, and prevent disease using clinical judgment. The doctor-patient relationship typically begins with an interaction with an examination of the patient's medical history and medical record, followed by a medical interview[11] and a physical examination. Basic diagnostic medical devices (e.g., stethoscope, tongue depressor) are typically used. After examining for signs and interviewing for symptoms, the doctor may order medical tests (e.g., blood tests), take a biopsy, or prescribe pharmaceutical drugs or other therapies. Differential diagnosis methods help to rule out conditions based on the information provided. During the encounter, properly informing the patient of all relevant facts is an important part of the relationship and the development of trust. The medical encounter is then documented in the medical record, which is a legal document in many jurisdictions.[12] Follow-ups may be shorter but follow the same general procedure, and specialists follow a similar process. The diagnosis and treatment may take only a few minutes or a few weeks, depending on the complexity of the issue.\nThe components of the medical interview[11] and encounter are:\n- Chief complaint (CC): the reason for the current medical visit. These are the symptoms. They are in the patient's own words and are recorded along with the duration of each one. Also called chief concern or presenting complaint.\n- Current activity: occupation, hobbies, what the patient actually does.\n- Family history (FH): listing of diseases in the family that may impact the patient. A family tree is sometimes used.\n- History of present illness (HPI): the chronological order of events of symptoms and further clarification of each symptom. Distinguishable from history of previous illness, often called past medical history (PMH). Medical history comprises HPI and PMH.\n- Medications (Rx): what drugs the patient takes including prescribed, over-the-counter, and home remedies, as well as alternative and herbal medicines or remedies. Allergies are also recorded.\n- Past medical history (PMH/PMHx): concurrent medical problems, past hospitalizations and operations, injuries, past infectious diseases or vaccinations, history of known allergies.\n- Review of systems (ROS) or systems inquiry: a set of additional questions to ask, which may be missed on HPI: a general enquiry (have you noticed any weight loss, change in sleep quality, fevers, lumps and bumps? etc.), followed by questions on the body's main organ systems (heart, lungs, digestive tract, urinary tract, etc.).\n- Social history (SH): birthplace, residences, marital history, social and economic status, habits (including diet, medications, tobacco, alcohol).\nThe physical examination is the examination of the patient for medical signs of disease that are objective and observable, in contrast to symptoms that are volunteered by the patient and are not necessarily objectively observable.[13] The healthcare provider uses sight, hearing, touch, and sometimes smell (e.g., in infection, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis). Four actions are the basis of physical examination: inspection, palpation (feel), percussion (tap to determine resonance characteristics), and auscultation (listen), generally in that order, although auscultation occurs prior to percussion and palpation for abdominal assessments.[14]\nThe clinical examination involves the study of:[15]\n- Abdomen and rectum\n- Cardiovascular (heart and blood vessels)\n- General appearance of the patient and specific indicators of disease (nutritional status, presence of jaundice, pallor or clubbing)\n- Genitalia (and pregnancy if the patient is or could be pregnant)\n- Head, eye, ear, nose, and throat (HEENT)[15]\n- Musculoskeletal (including spine and extremities)\n- Neurological (consciousness, awareness, brain, vision, cranial nerves, spinal cord and peripheral nerves)\n- Psychiatric (orientation, mental state, mood, evidence of abnormal perception or thought).\n- Respiratory (large airways and lungs)[15]\n- Skin\n- Vital signs including height, weight, body temperature, blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate, and hemoglobin oxygen saturation[15]\nIt is to likely focus on areas of interest highlighted in the medical history and may not include everything listed above.\nThe treatment plan may include ordering additional medical laboratory tests and medical imaging studies, starting therapy, referral to a specialist, or watchful observation. A follow-up may be advised. Depending upon the health insurance plan and the managed care system, various forms of \"utilization review\", such as prior authorization of tests, may place barriers on accessing expensive services.[16]\nThe medical decision-making (MDM) process includes the analysis and synthesis of all the above data to come up with a list of possible diagnoses (the differential diagnoses), along with an idea of what needs to be done to obtain a definitive diagnosis that would explain the patient's problem.",

      "raw_content": "medicine\nmedicine, the practice concerned with the maintenance of health and the prevention, alleviation, or cure of disease.\nThe World Health Organization at its 1978 international conference held in the Soviet Union produced the Alma-Ata Health Declaration, which was designed to serve governments as a basis for planning health care that would reach people at all levels of society. The declaration reaffirmed that\nhealth, which is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, is a fundamental human right and that the attainment of the highest possible level of health is a most important world-wide social goal whose realization requires the action of many other social and economic sectors in addition to the health sector.\nIn its widest form, the practice of medicine—that is to say, the promotion and care of health—is concerned with this ideal.\nOrganization of health services\nIt is generally the goal of most countries to have their health services organized in such a way to ensure that individuals, families, and communities obtain the maximum benefit from current knowledge and technology available for the promotion, maintenance, and restoration of health. In order to play their part in this process, governments and other agencies are faced with numerous tasks, including the following: (1) They must obtain as much information as is possible on the size, extent, and urgency of their needs; without accurate information, planning can be misdirected. (2) These needs must then be revised against the resources likely to be available in terms of money, manpower, and materials; developing countries may well require external aid to supplement their own resources. (3) Based on their assessments, countries then need to determine realistic objectives and draw up plans. (4) Finally, a process of evaluation needs to be built into the program; the lack of reliable information and accurate assessment can lead to confusion, waste, and inefficiency.\nHealth services of any nature reflect a number of interrelated characteristics, among which the most obvious, but not necessarily the most important from a national point of view, is the curative function; that is to say, caring for those already ill. Others include special services that deal with particular groups (such as children or pregnant women) and with specific needs such as nutrition or immunization; preventive services, the protection of the health both of individuals and of communities; health education; and, as mentioned above, the collection and analysis of information.\nLevels of health care\nIn the curative domain there are various forms of medical practice. They may be thought of generally as forming a pyramidal structure, with three tiers representing increasing degrees of specialization and technical sophistication but catering to diminishing numbers of patients as they are filtered out of the system at a lower level. Only those patients who require special attention either for diagnosis or treatment should reach the second (advisory) or third (specialized treatment) tiers where the cost per item of service becomes increasingly higher. The first level represents primary health care, or first contact care, at which patients have their initial contact with the health-care system.\nPrimary health care is an integral part of a country’s health maintenance system, of which it forms the largest and most important part. As described in the declaration of Alma-Ata, primary health care should be “based on practical, scientifically sound and socially acceptable methods and technology made universally accessible to individuals and families in the community through their full participation and at a cost that the community and country can afford to maintain at every stage of their development.” Primary health care in the developed countries is usually the province of a medically qualified physician; in the developing countries first contact care is often provided by nonmedically qualified personnel.\nThe vast majority of patients can be fully dealt with at the primary level. Those who cannot are referred to the second tier (secondary health care, or the referral services) for the opinion of a consultant with specialized knowledge or for X-ray examinations and special tests. Secondary health care often requires the technology offered by a local or regional hospital. Increasingly, however, the radiological and laboratory services provided by hospitals are available directly to the family doctor, thus improving his service to patients and increasing its range. The third tier of health care, employing specialist services, is offered by institutions such as teaching hospitals and units devoted to the care of particular groups—women, children, patients with mental disorders, and so on. The dramatic differences in the cost of treatment at the various levels is a matter of particular importance in developing countries, where the cost of treatment for patients at the primary health-care level is usually only a small fraction of that at the third level; medical costs at any level in such countries, however, are usually borne by the government.\nIdeally, provision of health care at all levels will be available to all patients; such health care may be said to be universal. The well-off, both in relatively wealthy industrialized countries and in the poorer developing world, may be able to get medical attention from sources they prefer and can pay for in the private sector. The vast majority of people in most countries, however, are dependent in various ways upon health services provided by the state, to which they may contribute comparatively little or, in the case of poor countries, nothing at all.",

      "raw_content": "Medication\nA medication (also called medicament, medicine, pharmaceutical drug, medicinal product, medicinal drug or simply drug) is a drug used to diagnose, cure, treat, or prevent disease.[1][2] Drug therapy (pharmacotherapy) is an important part of the medical field and relies on the science of pharmacology for continual advancement and on pharmacy for appropriate management.\nDrugs are classified in many ways. One of the key divisions is by level of control, which distinguishes prescription drugs (those that a pharmacist dispenses only on the medical prescription) from over-the-counter drugs (those that consumers can order for themselves). Medicines may be classified by mode of action, route of administration, biological system affected, or therapeutic effects. The World Health Organization keeps a list of essential medicines.\nDrug discovery and drug development are complex and expensive endeavors undertaken by pharmaceutical companies, academic scientists, and governments. As a result of this complex path from discovery to commercialization, partnering has become a standard practice for advancing drug candidates through development pipelines. Governments generally regulate what drugs can be marketed, how drugs are marketed, and in some jurisdictions, drug pricing. Controversies have arisen over drug pricing and disposal of used medications.\nDefinition\n[edit]Medication is a medicine or a chemical compound used to treat or cure illness. According to Encyclopædia Britannica, medication is \"a substance used in treating a disease or relieving pain\".[3]\nAs defined by the National Cancer Institute, dosage forms of medication can include tablets, capsules, liquids, creams, and patches. Medications can be administered in different ways, such as by mouth, by infusion into a vein, or by drops put into the ear or eye. A medication that does not contain an active ingredient and is used in research studies is called a placebo.[4]\nIn Europe, the term is \"medicinal product\", and it is defined by EU law as:\n- \"Any substance or combination of substances presented as having properties for treating or preventing disease in human beings; or\"\n- \"Any substance or combination of substances which may be used in or administered to human beings either with a view to restoring, correcting, or modifying physiological functions by exerting a pharmacological, immunological or metabolic action or to making a medical diagnosis.\"[5]: 36\nIn the US, a \"drug\" is:\n- A substance (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.\n- A substance intended for use as a component of a medicine but not a device or a component, part, or accessory of a device.\n- A substance intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease.\n- A substance recognized by an official pharmacopeia or formulary.\n- Biological products are included within this definition and are generally covered by the same laws and regulations, but differences exist regarding their manufacturing processes (chemical process versus biological process).[6]\nUsage\n[edit]Drug use among elderly Americans has been studied; in a group of 2,377 people with an average age of 71 surveyed between 2005 and 2006, 84% took at least one prescription drug, 44% took at least one over-the-counter (OTC) drug, and 52% took at least one dietary supplement; in a group of 2245 elderly Americans (average age of 71) surveyed over the period 2010 – 2011, those percentages were 88%, 38%, and 64%.[7]\nClassification\n[edit]One of the key classifications is between traditional small molecule drugs; usually derived from chemical synthesis and biological medical products; which include recombinant proteins, vaccines, blood products used therapeutically (such as IVIG), gene therapy, and cell therapy (for instance, stem cell therapies).[citation needed]\nPharmaceuticals or drugs or medicines are classified into various other groups besides their origin on the basis of pharmacological properties like mode of action and their pharmacological action or activity,[8] such as by chemical properties, mode or route of administration, biological system affected, or therapeutic effects. An elaborate and widely used classification system is the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System (ATC system). The World Health Organization keeps a list of essential medicines.\nA sampling of classes of medicine includes:\n- Antipyretics: reducing fever (pyrexia/pyresis)\n- Analgesics: reducing pain (painkillers)\n- Antimalarial drugs: treating malaria\n- Antibiotics: inhibiting germ growth\n- Antiseptics: prevention of germ growth near burns, cuts,and wounds\n- Mood stabilizers: lithium and valproate\n- Hormone replacements: Premarin\n- Oral contraceptives: Enovid, \"biphasic\" pill, and \"triphasic\" pill\n- Stimulants: methylphenidate, amphetamine\n- Tranquilizers: meprobamate, chlorpromazine, reserpine, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, and alprazolam\n- Statins: lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin\nPharmaceuticals may also be described as \"specialty\", independent of other classifications, which is an ill-defined class of drugs that might be difficult to administer, require special handling during administration, require patient monitoring during and immediately after administration, have particular regulatory requirements restricting their use, and are generally expensive relative to other drugs.[9]\nTypes of medicines\n[edit]For the digestive system\n[edit]- Lower digestive tract: laxatives, antispasmodics, antidiarrhoeals, bile acid sequestrants, opioids.\n- Upper digestive tract: antacids, reflux suppressants, antiflatulents, antidopaminergics, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), H2-receptor antagonists, cytoprotectants, prostaglandin analogues.\nFor the cardiovascular system\n[edit]- Affecting blood pressure/(antihypertensive drugs): ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, α blockers, calcium channel blockers, thiazide diuretics, loop diuretics, aldosterone inhibitors.\n- Coagulation: anticoagulants, heparin, antiplatelet drugs, fibrinolytics, anti-hemophilic factors, haemostatic drugs.\n- General: β-receptor blockers (\"beta blockers\"), calcium channel blockers, diuretics, cardiac glycosides, antiarrhythmics, nitrate, antianginals, vasoconstrictors, vasodilators.\n- HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) for lowering LDL cholesterol inhibitors: hypolipidaemic agents.\nFor the central nervous system\n[edit]Drugs affecting the central nervous system include psychedelics, hypnotics, anaesthetics, antipsychotics, eugeroics, antidepressants (including tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, lithium salts, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)), antiemetics, anticonvulsants/antiepileptics, anxiolytics, barbiturates, movement disorder (e.g., Parkinson's disease) drugs, nootropics, stimulants (including amphetamines), benzodiazepines, cyclopyrrolones, dopamine antagonists, antihistamines, cholinergics, anticholinergics, emetics, cannabinoids, and 5-HT (serotonin) antagonists.\nFor pain\n[edit]The main classes of painkillers are NSAIDs, opioids, and local anesthetics.\nFor consciousness (anesthetic drugs)\nSome anesthetics include benzodiazepines and barbiturates.\nFor musculoskeletal disorders\n[edit]The main categories of drugs for musculoskeletal disorders are: NSAIDs (including COX-2 selective inhibitors), muscle relaxants, neuromuscular drugs, and anticholinesterases.\nFor the eye\n[edit]- Anti-allergy: mast cell inhibitors.\n- Anti-fungal: imidazoles, polyenes.\n- Anti-glaucoma: adrenergic agonists, beta-blockers, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors/hyperosmotics, cholinergics, miotics, parasympathomimetics, prostaglandin agonists/prostaglandin inhibitors, nitroglycerin.\n- Anti-inflammatory: NSAIDs, corticosteroids.\n- Antibacterial: antibiotics, topical antibiotics, sulfa drugs, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones.\n- Antiviral drugs.",

      "raw_content": "Natural science\nNatural science or empirical science is one of the branches of science concerned with the description, understanding and prediction of natural phenomena, based on empirical evidence from observation and experimentation.[1] Mechanisms such as peer review and reproducibility of findings are used to try to ensure the validity of scientific advances.\nNatural science can be divided into two main branches: life science and physical science. Life science is alternatively known as biology. Physical science is subdivided into branches: physics, astronomy, Earth science and chemistry. These branches of natural science may be further divided into more specialized branches (also known as fields). As empirical sciences, natural sciences use tools from the formal sciences, such as mathematics and logic, converting information about nature into measurements that can be explained as clear statements of the \"laws of nature\".[2]\nModern natural science succeeded more classical approaches to natural philosophy. Galileo, Kepler, Descartes, Bacon, and Newton debated the benefits of using approaches which were more mathematical and more experimental in a methodical way. Still, philosophical perspectives, conjectures, and presuppositions, often overlooked, remain necessary in natural science.[3] Systematic data collection, including discovery science, succeeded natural history, which emerged in the 16th century by describing and classifying plants, animals, minerals, and so on.[4] Today, \"natural history\" suggests observational descriptions aimed at popular audiences.[5]\nCriteria\n[edit]Philosophers of science have suggested several criteria, including Karl Popper's controversial falsifiability criterion, to help them differentiate scientific endeavors from non-scientific ones. Validity, accuracy, and quality control, such as peer review and reproducibility of findings, are amongst the most respected criteria in today's global scientific community.\nIn natural science, impossibility assertions come to be widely accepted as overwhelmingly probable rather than considered proven to the point of being unchallengeable. The basis for this strong acceptance is a combination of extensive evidence of something not occurring, combined with an underlying theory, very successful in making predictions, whose assumptions lead logically to the conclusion that something is impossible. While an impossibility assertion in natural science can never be proved, it could be refuted by the observation of a single counterexample. Such a counterexample would require that the assumptions underlying the theory that implied the impossibility be re-examined.\nBranches of natural science\n[edit]Biology\n[edit]This field encompasses a diverse set of disciplines that examine phenomena related to living organisms. The scale of study can range from sub-component biophysics up to complex ecologies. Biology is concerned with the characteristics, classification and behaviors of organisms, as well as how species were formed and their interactions with each other and the environment.\nThe biological fields of botany, zoology, and medicine date back to early periods of civilization, while microbiology was introduced in the 17th century with the invention of the microscope. However, it was not until the 19th century that biology became a unified science. Once scientists discovered commonalities between all living things, it was decided they were best studied as a whole.\nSome key developments in biology were the discovery of genetics, evolution through natural selection, the germ theory of disease, and the application of the techniques of chemistry and physics at the level of the cell or organic molecule.\nModern biology is divided into subdisciplines by the type of organism and by the scale being studied. Molecular biology is the study of the fundamental chemistry of life, while cellular biology is the examination of the cell; the basic building block of all life. At a higher level, anatomy and physiology look at the internal structures, and their functions, of an organism, while ecology looks at how various organisms interrelate.\nEarth science\n[edit]Earth science (also known as geoscience) is an all-embracing term for the sciences related to the planet Earth, including geology, geography, geophysics, geochemistry, climatology, glaciology, hydrology, meteorology, and oceanography.\nAlthough mining and precious stones have been human interests throughout the history of civilization, the development of the related sciences of economic geology and mineralogy did not occur until the 18th century. The study of the earth, particularly paleontology, blossomed in the 19th century. The growth of other disciplines, such as geophysics, in the 20th century led to the development of the theory of plate tectonics in the 1960s, which has had a similar effect on the Earth sciences as the theory of evolution had on biology. Earth sciences today are closely linked to petroleum and mineral resources, climate research, and to environmental assessment and remediation.\nAtmospheric sciences\n[edit]Although sometimes considered in conjunction with the earth sciences, due to the independent development of its concepts, techniques, and practices and also the fact of it having a wide range of sub-disciplines under its wing, atmospheric science is also considered a separate branch of natural science. This field studies the characteristics of different layers of the atmosphere from ground level to the edge of the space. The timescale of the study also varies from day to century. Sometimes, the field also includes the study of climatic patterns on planets other than Earth.[6]\nOceanography\n[edit]The serious study of oceans began in the early- to mid-20th century. As a field of natural science, it is relatively young, but stand-alone programs offer specializations in the subject. Though some controversies remain as to the categorization of the field under earth sciences, interdisciplinary sciences, or as a separate field in its own right, most modern workers in the field agree that it has matured to a state that it has its own paradigms and practices.\nPlanetary science\n[edit]Planetary science or planetology, is the scientific study of planets, which include terrestrial planets like the Earth, and other types of planets, such as gas giants and ice giants. Planetary science also concerns other celestial bodies, such as dwarf planets moons, asteroids, and comets. This largely includes the Solar System, but recently has started to expand to exoplanets, particularly terrestrial exoplanets. It explores various objects, spanning from micrometeoroids to gas giants, to establish their composition, movements, genesis, interrelation, and past. Planetary science is an interdisciplinary domain, having originated from astronomy and Earth science, and currently encompassing a multitude of areas, such as planetary geology, cosmochemistry, atmospheric science, physics, oceanography, hydrology, theoretical planetology, glaciology, and exoplanetology. Related fields encompass space physics, which delves into the impact of the Sun on the bodies in the Solar System, and astrobiology.\nPlanetary science comprises interconnected observational and theoretical branches. Observational research entails a combination of space exploration, primarily through robotic spacecraft missions utilizing remote sensing, and comparative experimental work conducted in Earth-based laboratories. The theoretical aspect involves extensive mathematical modelling and computer simulation.\nTypically, planetary scientists are situated within astronomy and physics or Earth sciences departments in universities or research centers. However, there are also dedicated planetary science institutes worldwide. Generally, individuals pursuing a career in planetary science undergo graduate-level studies in one of the Earth sciences, astronomy, astrophysics, geophysics, or physics.",

The term natural science is also used to distinguish those fields that use the scientific method to study nature from the social sciences, which use the scientific method to study human behavior, and from the formal sciences, such as mathematics and logic, which use a different methodology.\nOverview[]\nNatural sciences form the basis for the applied sciences. Together, the natural and applied sciences are distinguished from the social sciences on the one hand, and from the humanities, theology and the arts on the other. Mathematics, statistics and computer science are not considered natural sciences, but provide many tools and frameworks used within the natural sciences.\nAlongside this traditional usage, the phrase natural sciences is also sometimes used more narrowly to refer to its everyday usage, that is, related to natural history. In this sense \"natural sciences\" may refer to the biological sciences and perhaps also the earth sciences, as distinguished from the physical sciences, including astronomy, physics, and chemistry.\nWithin the natural sciences, the term hard science is sometimes used to describe those sub-fields that rely on experimental, quantifiable data or the scientific method and focus on accuracy and objectivity. These usually include physics, chemistry and many of the sub-fields of biology. By contrast, soft science is often used to describe the scientific fields that are more reliant on qualitiative research, including the social sciences.\nSee Category:Science for articles about the individual Natural sciences\nA narrower view[]\nAccording to a famous 1923 textbook Thermodynamics – and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances by the American chemist Gilbert Lewis and the American physical chemist Merle Randall, the natural sciences contain three great branches:\nAside from the logical and mathematical sciences, there are three great branches of natural science which stand apart by reason of the variety of far reaching deductions drawn from a small number of primary postulates – they are the mechanics, electrodynamics, and thermodynamics.\nHistory[]\nPrior to the 17th century, the objective study of nature was known as natural philosophy. Over the next two centuries, however, a philosophical interpretation of nature was gradually replaced by a scientific approach using inductive methodology. The works of Sir Francis Bacon popularized this approach, thereby helping to forge the scientific revolution.\nBy the 19th century the study of science had come into the purview of professionals and institutions, and in so doing it gradually acquired the more modern name of natural science. The term scientist was coined by William Whewell in an 1834 review of Mary Somerville's On the Connexion of the Sciences. However the word did not enter general use until nearly the end of the same century.\nDisciplines of natural sciences[]\nAstronomy[]\n- Main article: Astronomy\nThis discipline is the science of celestial objects and phenomena that originate outside the Earth's atmosphere. It is concerned with the evolution, physics, chemistry, meteorology, and motion of celestial objects, as well as the formation and development of the universe. Astronomy includes the examination, study and modeling of stars, planets, comets, galaxies and the cosmos. Most of the information used by astronomers is gathered by remote observation, although some laboratory reproduction of celestial phenomenon has been performed (such as the molecular chemisty of the interstellar medium.)\nWhile the origins of the study of celestial features and phenomenon can be traced back to antiquity, the scientific methodology of this field began to develop in the middle of the seventeenth century. A key factor was Galileo's introduction of the telescope to examine the night sky in more detail. The mathematical treatment of astronomy began with Newton's development of celestial mechanics and the laws of gravitation, although it was triggered by earlier work of astronomers such as Kepler. By the nineteenth century, astronomy had developed into a formal science with the introduction of instruments such as the spectroscope and photography, along with much improved telescopes and the creation of professional observatories.\nBiology[]\n- Main article: Biology\nThis field encompasses a set of disciplines that examines phenomena related to living organisms. The scale of study can range from sub-component biophysics up to complex ecologies. Biology is concerned with the characteristics, classification and behaviors of organisms, as well as how species were formed and their interactions with each other and the natural environment.\nThe biological fields of botany, zoology, and medicine date back to early periods of civilization, while microbiology was introduced in the 17th century with the invention of the microscope. However it was not until the 19th century that biology became a unified science; once scientists discovered commonalities between all living things it was decided they were best studied as a whole. Some key developments in the science of biology were the discovery of genetics; Darwin's theory of evolution through natural selection; the germ theory of disease and the application of the techniques of chemistry and physics at the level of the cell or organic molecule.\nModern Biology is divided into sub-disciplines by the type of organism and by the scale being studied. Molecular biology is the study of the fundamental chemistry of life, while cellular biology is the examination of the cell; the basic building block of all life. At a higher level, Physiology looks at the internal structure of organism, while ecology looks at how various organisms interrelate.\nChemistry[]\n- Main article: Chemistry\nConstituting the scientific study of matter at the atomic and molecular scale, chemistry deals primarily with collections of atoms, such as gases, molecules, crystals, and metals. The composition, statistical properties, transformations and reactions of these materials are studied. Chemistry also involves understanding the properties and interactions of individual atoms for use in larger-scale applications. Most chemical processes can be studied directly in a laboratory, using a series of (often well-tested) techniques for manipulating materials, as well as an understanding of the underlying processes.\nEarth science[]\n- Main article: Earth science\nThe study of Earth, including geology, geophysics, hydrology, meteorology, physical geography, oceanography, and soil science.\nPhysics[]\n- Main article: Physics\nThe study of the fundamental constituents of the universe, the forces and interactions they exert on one another, and the results produced by these forces.\nCross-disciplines[]\nThe distinctions between the natural science disciplines is not always sharp, and they share a number of cross-discipline fields. Physics plays a significant role in the other natural sciences, as represented by astrophysics, geophysics, physical chemistry and biophysics. Likewise chemistry is represented by such fields as biochemistry and astrochemistry.\nSee also[]\n- List of academic disciplines\n- Nature\n- Natural history\n- Natural philosophy, the precursor of the physical sciences, but especially physics.",

      "raw_content": "What Is Natural Science? 5 Definitions\nUpdated: June 19, 2024\nStudents learn different types of natural science throughout different stages of their schooling. In elementary school, you might learn basics about the Earth, in high school you’ll begin to explore biology, and then at the university level, the sky’s the limit.\nBut did you know that there are five major types of natural sciences? Each one looks at different aspects of our world (and some beyond) with the purpose of researching and making sense of it all. Let’s take a closer look at what natural science is, including its meaning, the different branches, and natural science courses you can take.\nSource: Unsplash Alt text: view of a satellite and earth from space in the study of space science\nNatural Science: Definition\nThere’s no one answer to the question “What is natural science?” Natural science is made up of different branches, like physics, chemistry, or biology. However, the one thing they mostly all have in common is that, in general, natural science deals with matter in the same way.\nAccording to Merriam Webster’s definition of natural science, it’s any science that deals with “matter, energy, and their interrelations and transformations or with objectively measurable phenomena.”\nThe Meaning of Natural Science\nNow that we’ve defined natural science, you probably want a deeper understanding of what it really means, at its core.\nNatural science is based completely around events and phenomena that occur naturally.\nHumans have a curiosity as to why certain things occur in nature, and this is where natural science comes in. Researchers and scientists explore these natural events to better understand them and why they took place.\nThis research can then be used to predict future events or explain why and how things happen in nature so that we can protect or even mimic these processes.\nNatural science should not be confused with social science, which seeks to understand humans, not nature. Natural science helps humans understand the world around them and to seek explanations for the seemingly unexplainable, whether that’s weather patterns or how stars and galaxies are formed.\nHowever, one similarity between social science and natural science is their ultimate goal: to learn. As humans, we want to understand and learn more about the world around us and the people in them, and this concept is shared between many types of sciences.\nThe Two Main Subjects in Natural Sciences\nNatural science can be further broken down into two categories: life sciences and physical sciences.\nLife science refers to things like biology or human anatomy, in other words, sciences that revolve around all living things on Earth.\nPhysical science covers the rest of the natural sciences, like chemistry and physics, for example, so the areas that aren’t directly related to life.\nStill, there are five primary branches that make up natural sciences, with each one falling into one of these two categories.\nThe Five Main Branches of Natural Science\nSource: Unsplash Alt text: beakers in a lab used by chemists who study natural science\nJust as social science has different branches like psychology, history, or anthropology, natural science also has different branches. Let’s take a closer look at each one to understand what they entail.\n1. Biology\nAs we established earlier, biology falls under the life sciences category since it deals with living organisms on earth. Biologists can study a variety of different types of lives, from humans to animals, plants, or even microorganisms.\nBiology seeks to understand the lives of all organisms, such as their physical being as well as their place in the world and how they interact with the environment.\nThere are many different topics you can study that fall under the umbrella of biologies, such as food science, animal biology, agriculture, or human biology.\n2. Chemistry\nChemistry works with matter and studies how atoms come together and react to each other. Part of chemistry is researching things like chemical behavior, reactions, properties of different matter, their structure, and composition.\nChemists will perform experiments to study how matter bonds or interacts with each other for the purpose of discovery.\nThere are a lot of different things you can accomplish with chemistry, like creating new medicines, studying chemicals in the environment, and creating new compounds.\n3. Earth Sciences\nEarth sciences is one branch of natural science, but it itself is made up of a few different types of sciences, namely geology, oceanography, geography, atmospheric sciences, and planetary science.\nEach one of these focuses on a different area of what makes the earth what it is. For example, atmospheric scientists work closely with climate scientists to look at the world’s atmosphere and its effect on the ecosystem.\nAll the earth science fields look at different natural phenomena that occur on Earth and aim to understand them better.\n4. Physics\nPhysics is the study of the properties of matter and energy. In physics, scientists look at aspects of motion, force, time, energy, space, and more to understand how the world works.\nPhysicists can study many different elements relating to nature and energy and might focus on topics like how heat and light work, radiation, mechanics, electricity, and more.\nIn fact, within physics, you can study something as small as atom structure or something as large as galaxies.\n5. Space Sciences\nThis will also be referred to by some as astronomy, but it’s a lot more than just astronomy since space sciences involve everything from studying planets to planning space exploration.\nThere’s so much still unknown about the universe beyond planet Earth, and this branch of science is focused on learning more about all the natural phenomena that occur in space.\nSome of the topics that make up space sciences are fields like aerospace engineering, cosmology, astrobiology, planetary science, and more.\nWhat Does Studying Natural Science Involve?\nLike many subjects in the field of science, you’ll need to have a good understanding of mathematics. Many subjects like physics and chemistry used advanced mathematics to work on experiments.\nThe number of degrees you need might depend on the field you choose to study in, but in general, your focus will begin to narrow the further you get into your studies. You can start off by studying more than one of the natural sciences, and then, as your interests change, you’ll begin to narrow down your field of study as you go into a master’s or PhD program.\nCommon Natural Science Courses\nThis list will give you a small taste of some of the courses you might be able to take when you study one or more of the branches of natural science. Of course, this list isn’t exhaustive as the topics you can study are vast and varied, but this should give you a good idea of what to expect.\n- Microbiology: In a microbiology course, you’ll look at how microorganisms function. You might work in a lab as well to gain practical experience.\n- Cosmology: In a cosmology or general relativity course, you’ll cover a lot of topics relating to the history of the universe as well as things related to gravity, space and time, and more.\n- Physics: Many physics courses will involve analyzing force and motion, and you’ll likely cover topics like methodologies and different scientific theories.\n- Oceanography: Courses in oceanography will cover topics like marine mammals and environments as well as the oceans and climate change.\n- Biological anthropology: Students in this type of course will learn about evolution as well as other topics related to genetics, human adaptation, or might even work on lab experiments.\nTo Wrap Up\nNatural science involves five different branches that are each made up of thrilling fields of science.",

      "raw_content": "Nursing\nNursing is a health care profession that \"integrates the art and science of caring and focuses on the protection, promotion, and optimization of health and human functioning; prevention of illness and injury; facilitation of healing; and alleviation of suffering through compassionate presence\".[1] Nurses practice in many specialties with varying levels of certification and responsibility. Nurses comprise the largest component of most healthcare environments.[2][3] There are shortages of qualified nurses in many countries.[4]\nNurses develop a plan of care, working collaboratively with physicians, therapists, patients, patients' families, and other team members that focuses on treating illness to improve quality of life.\nIn the United Kingdom and the United States, clinical nurse specialists and nurse practitioners diagnose health problems and prescribe medications and other therapies, depending on regulations that vary by state.[5] Nurses may help coordinate care performed by other providers or act independently as nursing professionals. In addition to providing care and support, nurses educate the public and promote health and wellness.[6]\nIn the U.S., nurse practitioners are nurses with a graduate degree in advanced practice nursing, and are permitted to prescribe medications. They practice independently in a variety of settings in more than half of the United States. In the postwar period, nurse education has diversified, awarding advanced and specialized credentials, and many traditional regulations and roles are changing.[7][8]\nHistory\nPremodern\nNursing historians face challenges of determining whether care provided to the sick or injured in antiquity is called nursing care.[9] In the fifth century BC, for example, the Hippocratic Collection in places described skilled care and observation of patients by male \"attendants,\" who may have provided care now provided by nurses.[10] Around 600 BC in India, it is recorded in Sushruta Samhita, Book 3, Chapter V about the role of the nurse[citation needed] as \"the different parts or members of the body as mentioned before including the skin, cannot be correctly described by one who is not well versed in anatomy. Hence, anyone desirous of acquiring a thorough knowledge of anatomy should prepare a dead body and carefully, observe, by dissecting it, and examining its different parts.\"\nIn the Middle Ages, members of religious orders such as nuns and monks often provided nursing-like care.[11] Examples exist in Christian,[12] Islamic,[13] Buddhist,[14] and other traditions. The biblical figure of Phoebe is described in many sources as \"the first visiting nurse\".[15][16] These traditions were influential in the development of the ethos of modern nursing. Its religious roots remain in evidence in many countries. One example in the United Kingdom is the use of the historical title \"sister\" to refer to a senior nurse.[17]\nDuring the Reformation, Protestant reformers shut down monasteries and convents, allowing a few hundred municipal hospices to remain in operation in northern Europe. Nuns who had been serving as nurses were given pensions or told to marry and stay home.[18] Nursing care went to the inexperienced as traditional caretakers, rooted in the Roman Catholic Church, were removed from their positions. The nursing profession in Europe was extinguished for approximately 200 years.[19]\n19th century\nDuring the Crimean War, Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna called for women to join the Order of Exaltation of the Cross (Krestodvizhenskaya Obshchina) for a year of service in military hospitals. The first section of twenty-eight \"sisters\", headed by Aleksandra Petrovna Stakhovich, the Directress of the Order, reached Crimea early in November 1854.[20]\nFlorence Nightingale laid the foundations of professional nursing after the Crimean War,[22] in light of a comprehensive statistical study she made of sanitation in India, leading her to emphasize the importance of sanitation. \"After 10 years of sanitary reform, in 1873, Nightingale reported that mortality among the soldiers in India had declined from 69 to 18 per 1,000\".[23]: 107\nNightingale believed that nursing was a social freedom and mission for women. She believed that any educated woman could help improve the care of the ill.[24] Her Notes on Nursing (1859) was a popular call to action. The Nightingale model of nursing education led to one of the first schools of nursing to be connected to a hospital and medical school. It spread widely in Europe and North America after 1870.[25]\nNightingale included five factors that helped nurses in her time who worked amidst poor sanitation and little education. These factors included fresh air, clean water, a working drainage system, cleanliness, and good light. Nightingale believed that a clean working environment was important in caring for patients. In the 19th century, this theory was ideal for helping patients, providing a guide for nurses to alter the environment around patients for the betterment of their health.[26]\nNightingale's recommendations built upon the successes of Jamaican \"doctresses\" such as Mary Seacole, who like Nightingale, served in the Crimean War. Seacole practised hygiene and the use of herbs in healing wounded soldiers and those suffering from diseases in the 19th century in the Crimea, Central America, and Jamaica. Her predecessors had great success as healers in the Colony of Jamaica in the 18th century, and they included Seacole's mother (Mrs. Grant), Sarah Adams, Cubah Cornwallis, and Grace Donne, the mistress and doctress to Jamaica's wealthiest planter, Simon Taylor.[27]\nOther important nurses in the development of the profession include:\n- Agnes Hunt from Shropshire was the first orthopedic nurse and was pivotal in the emergence of the orthopedic hospital, the Robert Jones & Agnes Hunt Hospital in Oswestry, Shropshire.\n- Valérie de Gasparin opened, with her husband Agénor de Gasparin, the world's first nursing school: La Source [fr], in Lausanne, Switzerland.\n- Agnes Jones established a nurse training regime at Brownlow Hill infirmary, Liverpool, in 1865.\n- Linda Richards established nursing schools in the United States and Japan, and was officially the first professionally trained nurse in the US, graduating in 1873 from the New England Hospital for Women and Children in Boston.\n- Clarissa Harlowe \"Clara\" Barton was a pioneer American teacher, patent clerk, nurse, and humanitarian, and the founder of the American Red Cross.\n- Saint Marianne Cope was a Sister of St. Francis who opened and operated some of the first general hospitals in the United States, instituting cleanliness standards that influenced the development of America's hospital system.[28]\nRed Cross chapters, which began appearing after the establishment of the International Committee of the Red Cross in 1863, offered employment and professionalization opportunities for nurses (despite Nightingale's initial objections).[29] Catholic orders such as Little Sisters of the Poor, Sisters of Mercy, Sisters of St. Mary, St. Francis Health Services, Inc. and Sisters of Charity built hospitals and provided nursing services during this period.[citation needed][30] The modern deaconess movement began in Germany in 1836.[31] Within a half century, over 5,000 deaconesses had surfaced in Europe.[32]\nFormal use of nurses in the military began in the latter half of the nineteenth century. Nurses saw active duty in the First Boer War, the Egyptian Campaign (1882),[33] and the Sudan Campaign (1883).[34]\n20th century\nIn the 19th and early 20th century, nursing was considered a woman's profession, just as doctoring was a profession for men. With increasing expectations of workplace equality during the late 20th century, nursing became an officially gender-neutral profession, though in practice the percentage of male nurses remained well below that of female physicians in the 21st century.",

      "raw_content": "What is Nursing?\n_____________________________________________________________________________\nDEFINITION OF NURSING\nNursing integrates the art and science of caring and focuses on the protection, promotion, and optimization of health and human functioning; prevention of illness and injury; facilitation of healing; and alleviation of suffering through compassionate presence. Nursing is the diagnosis and treatment of human responses and advocacy in the care of individuals, families, groups, communities, and populations in recognition of the connection of all humanity.\nANA (2021). Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, Fourth Edition, p. 1.\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n21st Century nursing is the glue that holds a patient’s health care journey together. Across the entire patient experience, and wherever there is someone in need of care, nurses work tirelessly to identify and protect the needs of the individual.\nBeyond the time-honored reputation for compassion and dedication lies a highly specialized profession, which is constantly evolving to address the needs of society. From ensuring the most accurate diagnoses to the ongoing education of the public about critical health issues; nurses are indispensable in safeguarding public health.\nNursing can be described as both an art and a science; a heart and a mind. At its heart, lies a fundamental respect for human dignity and an intuition for a patient’s needs. This is supported by the mind, in the form of rigorous core learning. Due to the vast range of specialisms and complex skills in the nursing profession, each nurse will have specific strengths, passions, and expertise.\nHowever, nursing has a unifying ethos: In assessing a patient, nurses do not just consider test results. Through the critical thinking exemplified in the nursing process (see below), nurses use their judgment to integrate objective data with subjective experience of a patient’s biological, physical and behavioral needs. This ensures that every patient, from city hospital to community health center; state prison to summer camp, receives the best possible care regardless of who they are, or where they may be.\nWhat exactly do nurses do?\nIn a field as varied as nursing, there is no typical answer. Responsibilities can range from making acute treatment decisions to providing inoculations in schools. The key unifying characteristic in every role is the skill and drive that it takes to be a nurse. Through long-term monitoring of patients’ behavior and knowledge-based expertise, nurses are best placed to take an all-encompassing view of a patient’s wellbeing.\nWhat types of nurses are there?\nAll nurses complete a rigorous program of extensive education and study, and work directly with patients, families, and communities using the core values of the nursing process. In the United States today, nursing roles can be divided into three categories by the specific responsibilities they undertake.\nRegistered Nurses\nRegistered nurses (RN) form the backbone of health care provision in the United States. RNs provide critical health care to the public wherever it is needed.\nKey Responsibilities\n- Perform physical exams and health histories before making critical decisions\n- Provide health promotion, counseling and education\n- Administer medications and other personalized interventions\n- Coordinate care, in collaboration with a wide array of health care professionals\nAdvanced Practice Registered Nurses\nAdvance Practice Registered Nurses (APRN) hold at least a Master’s degree, in addition to the initial nursing education and licensing required for all RNs. The responsibilities of an APRN include, but are not limited to, providing invaluable primary and preventative health care to the public. APRNs treat and diagnose illnesses, advise the public on health issues, manage chronic disease and engage in continuous education to remain at the very forefront of any technological, methodological, or other developments in the field.\nAPRNs Practice Specialist Roles\n- Nurse Practitioners prescribe medication, diagnose and treat minor illnesses and injuries\n- Certified Nurse-Midwives provide gynecological and low-risk obstetrical care\n- Clinical Nurse Specialists handle a wide range of physical and mental health problems\n- Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists administer more than 65 percent of all anesthetics\nLicensed Practical Nurses\nLicensed Practical Nurses (LPN), also known as Licensed Vocational Nurses (LVNs), support the core health care team and work under the supervision of an RN, APRN or MD. By providing basic and routine care, they ensure the wellbeing of patients throughout the whole of the health care journey\nKey Responsibilities\n- Check vital signs and look for signs that health is deteriorating or improving\n- Perform basic nursing functions such as changing bandages and wound dressings\n- Ensure patients are comfortable, well-fed and hydrated\n- May administer medications in some settings\nWhat is the nursing process?\nNo matter what their field or specialty, all nurses utilize the same nursing process; a scientific method designed to deliver the very best in patient care, through five simple steps.\n- Assessment – Nurses assess patients on an in-depth physiological, economic, social and lifestyle basis.\n- Diagnosis – Through careful consideration of both physical symptoms and patient behavior, the nurse forms a diagnosis.\n- Outcomes / Planning – The nurse uses their expertise to set realistic goals for the patient’s recovery. These objectives are then closely monitored.\n- Implementation – By accurately implementing the care plan, nurses guarantee consistency of care for the patient whilst meticulously documenting their progress.\n- Evaluation – By closely analyzing the effectiveness of the care plan and studying patient response, the nurse hones the plan to achieve the very best patient outcomes.\nNurses are Key to the Health of the Nation\n- There are over 4 million registered nurses in the United States today.\n- That means that one in every 100 people is a registered nurse.\n- Nurses are in every community – large and small – providing expert care from birth to the end of life.\n- According to the January 2012 “United States Registered Nurse Workforce Report Card and Shortage Forecast” in the American Journal of Medical Quality, a shortage of registered nurses is projected to spread across the country between 2009 and 2030. In this state-by-state analysis, the authors forecast the RN shortage to be most intense in the South and the West\n- Nurses' roles range from direct patient care and case management to establishing nursing practice standards, developing quality assurance procedures, and directing complex nursing care systems.\nThe nursing profession was founded to protect, promote, and improve health for all ages.",

      "raw_content": "What does a nurse do?\nThe fundamentals of nursing are to deliver direct patient care and act as an advocate and health educator for patients, families, and communities.\nNurses work to promote health, prevent disease, and help patients with illnesses. When treating a patient, they observe, assess, and record symptoms, reactions, and progress. Nurses work alongside doctors when it comes to treatment plans and exams, administering medications, and monitoring patient recovery.\nScope of practice\nNurses can work in any specialty area across many different areas of the hospital. Each area will have a different set of responsibilities, but a common set of duties includes:\n- Patient intake and obtaining measurements, vitals, and health histories\n- Monitoring patient vitals regularly\n- Giving medication, recording doses, and timing\n- Performing hands-on technical, and medical duties\n- Communicating with patients about their care plan\n- Charting and working with electronic health record software\n- Relaying important information to the treating physician and other healthcare staff as needed\nUnless you are a nurse practitioner, nurses do not prescribe medication or make diagnoses, but they do carry out physicians’ orders for administering medication and other items on a patient’s care plan.\nTypes of nurses\nThere are several different types of nurses. Nurses are needed in virtually every area of medicine. Depending on your level of education, interests, and experience level, you can excel in any area of medicine.\nDifferent types of nursing degrees by level of education or certification\nThe field of nursing offers several levels of practice, each with different educational requirements.\nLicensed practical nurse (L.P.N.)\nUnder the supervision of registered nurses and physicians, L.P.N.s may care for patients of all ages. Using learned technical skills, L.P.N.s assist patients in meeting their physical and psychosocial needs. They also administer medications and perform treatments.\nMany employment opportunities are available to L.P.N.s in hospitals, clinics, nursing homes and home care. Graduates are awarded a diploma or certificate in practical nursing and are eligible to apply to take the National Council Licensure Examination for Practical Nurses (NCLEX-PN).\nRegistered nurse (R.N.): Associate degree\nThe associate degree nursing program is designed to prepare graduates who administer safe, patient-centered nursing care in hospitals, home settings, nursing homes, clinics, and other healthcare facilities. Graduates are awarded an Associate of Science degree in nursing and are eligible to apply to take the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN).\nRegistered nurse (R.N.): Bachelor's degree with a major in nursing\nThe bachelor's degree in nursing is designed to provide opportunities for students to develop a sound theoretical and clinical foundation for the practice of professional (registered) nursing. Graduates are prepared for a variety of roles in hospitals, nursing homes, and community health settings. Graduates are awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in nursing and are eligible to take the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX-RN).\nAdvanced clinical practice registered nurse (A.P.R.N.): Master's and doctoral degrees\nRegistered nurses with advanced training in education, research, administration, transcultural nursing, nursing leadership, and information technology — master's and doctoral degrees\nAdvanced clinical practice registered nurse and other advanced training: Master's degree and doctoral degree (Ph.D., D.N.P.)\nGraduate study in nursing is designed to expand students' base of theoretical knowledge in nursing. Through scholarly inquiry, nurses in the master's program are prepared to manage and facilitate complex health care in many settings. The master's-prepared nurse may assume roles such as clinical nurse specialist, nurse educator, nurse practitioner, nurse-midwife, nurse anesthetist, or nurse administrator.\nDoctoral programs prepare nurse scholars who generate, expand and disseminate nursing knowledge. They assume roles in practice, research, and education as advanced clinicians, administrators, educators, researchers, or policymakers.\nNursing is a profession in which your education, knowledge, skills, and experiences provide career flexibility and variety and can offer continued advancement and growth.\nDifferent types of nurses by medical specialty field, department, or population\nNurses have the flexibility to work throughout the hospital or medical clinic in a variety of medical specialties. Working in a specific specialty or with a specific population of patients means you’ll typically work with patients experiencing common symptoms or being treated for similar conditions.\nAnother way to decide which type of nurse you want to become is by how the work unit is organized within the hospital. Working in a specific department still allows you to see and help treat a wide variety of patients with a variety of conditions and symptoms.\nCommon areas of specialization by medical specialty, department, or population include:\n- Cardiac care nurse\n- Emergency room nurse\n- Family medicine nurse\n- Geriatric nurse\n- Intensive care unit (ICU) registered nurse\n- Labor and delivery nurse\n- Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) nurse\n- Neurology nurse\n- Obstetrics (OB) nurse\n- Oncology nurse\n- Operating room (OR) nurse\n- Pediatric nurse\n- Surgical nurse\n- Women’s health nurse\n- Among many others\nWork environment\nOn a given day, nurses may work with doctors, residents, nursing assistants, home health aides, speech therapists, occupational therapists, other nurses, and patients of all ages, from infants to the elderly.\nHospital work environment: In hospitals, nurses may be assigned to several patients from their unit and will check in on the patients throughout their shift, administering medications as needed, as well as writing down any symptoms or information on their condition.\nClinic work environment: In a clinic setting, nurses will often do patient intake, which involves taking vitals and entering basic health information for patients before they see the doctor, administering vaccinations, and delivering medications.\nLaboratory work environment: Nurses in laboratory roles will mainly draw blood for a variety of tests and may monitor patients for urine tests or gather other fluid samples.\nPositions can be anywhere from 10 to 40+ hours a week, and nurses often need to cover shifts on some holidays and weekends. Nurses are employed in hospitals, medical clinics, schools, nursing homes, and home health agencies.\nBecoming a nurse\nAll paths to becoming a nurse require post-secondary education. Candidates for careers in nursing should be comfortable working closely with people from diverse backgrounds and should be motivated to help sick patients feel better.\nIn any nursing role, multitasking and time management are essential skills to being successful at managing patients in a fast-paced healthcare environment. Empathy and good communication are important factors in providing quality nursing care; developing positive relationships with your patients and their families helps patients feel better and more comfortable in a clinic or hospital.\nMany nurses choose their profession based on a desire to work in health care and are determined to make a difference in the lives of others on a daily basis. Regardless of the setting — hospital, clinic, or laboratory — nurses may spend significantly more time with a patient than the treating physician, so there are daily opportunities to leave a lasting impression on people from your community.\nHigher education requirements\nThe field of nursing offers several levels of practice, each with different educational requirements. To practice, some nurses earn a certificate while others complete a doctorate.",

      "raw_content": "Nurse\nA nurse is a person who is trained to give care to people who are sick or injured. Nurses work with doctors and other health care workers to make patients well and to keep them fit and healthy. Nurses also help with end-of-life needs and assist other family members with grieving.\nNursing is a profession, like a doctor, but training for a nurse is different in how long a person must train and what kind of training they need. In some places, nurses may train for three to five years or more before they get a license as a nurse.\nNurses work in many places. Nurses work in hospitals, in doctor's offices, and in the community, and they even visit people at home if they can not get out.\nSometimes people decide to become nurses rather than doctors, because the nurses will be able to help patients directly, by talking to them, doing things they need, carefully watching that nothing goes wrong, and then seeing them as they get better.\nLike doctors, nurses can choose what work they do. Some nurses train and work to help during surgery. Some nurses train to help people understand health problems like nutrition (what to eat), and disease (what can make people sick). Nurses can do many different jobs to help people.\nNurses are in demand across the world because there are not enough nurses to handle the growing number of people who need care Some nurses travel to another location to work for a few months in what is called travel nursing. Many migrate to richer countries. The British National Health Service, like many others, has relied for many years on importing nurses from poorer countries because not enough were trained in the UK. In 2023 there were more Ghanaian nurses in NHS than in Ghana.[1] Nursing associates – who have less training – were introduced in 2018. 7,900 nursing associates were working in the NHS in 2022 but only 391 have gone on to become a registered nurse[2]\nTitles\n[change | change source]Registered Nurse in some countries like U.S is a term for an officially registered nurse.[3][4] In hospitals where nurses wear uniforms with caps, an R.N. is recognizable by the fact that the cap has two black stripes.\nNursing in Australia\n[change | change source]Nursing in Australia is done by Registered Nurses or Enrolled Nurses. Both must complete education past high school. An Enrolled Nurse must complete a course of study between 12 and 18 months. Registered Nurses need to complete a Bachelor's degree.\nGender-neutral titles\n[change | change source]Titles have changed because men as well as women can be nurses. It was, in most countries, a wholly female occupation. The titles were designed for females and have now been revised to be genderless. The exception to this is midwife, a term still used because it seems natural that a nurse helping a mother through childbirth should be a female. There are some males acting as midwives.[5] The supervisory body for UK nursing is the Nursing and Midwifery Council.\nTeams\n[change | change source]Some medical and surgical groups operate as teams. This means that senior surgeons always operate with the same group of people, so reducing the risk of mistakes, and allowing juniors to learn and understand the individual cases.\nAlso, moving around as a team allows specialist groups to serve more than one hospital. This is particularly useful when the amount of work in a speciality does not permit having a full team on site in each hospital.\nReferences\n[change | change source]- ↑ \"More Ghanaian nurses in NHS than in Ghana\".

      "raw_content": "Nursing degrees in the United States\nNursing is the largest healthcare profession in the United States, with more than 3.1 million registered nurses.[1] Between 2012 and 2022, employment for nurses is projected to grow by 19 percent, which is more than any other profession.[2] Nurses make up the largest component of staff in hospitals but are also able to provide care in clinic settings, patient's homes, schools, nursing homes, public health agencies, and mental health centers. In addition, nurses can be found in the military, in industry, nursing education, and do health care research.[3] Nurses in these various roles and settings can provide direct patient care and case management, but also develop and establish nursing practice and quality standards within complex healthcare systems. As each degree can provide a different level of care for patients and function in vastly different roles, it is important to differentiate between them. The levels of nursing degrees have different educational requirements, licensure, and credentialing that can vary state to state.\nLicensed Practical Nurse\n[edit]The education required for a Licensed Practical Nurse/Licensed Vocational Nurse is the completion of a 12-18 month program, typically at a technical college. The program focuses on task activities and prepares the nurse for the National Council Licensure Examination for Licensed Practical Nurses (NCLEX).[4] Requirements for taking the NCLEX-PN include having a high school diploma or equivalent and successful completion of an accredited practical/vocational nursing program. LPN/LVNs work in a variety of settings including hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, rehabilitation centers, schools, and individual or group homes.[5] Scope of practice for LPN/LVNs is defined by individual states, but each organization may narrow the scope of the LPN/LVN.[6]\nHospital-Based Diploma Nurse\n[edit]Hospital-based Diplomas in Nursing were historically the primary form of nursing education, first appearing in the early 20th century. The number of facilities offering this degree as well as the number of nurses obtaining their education through them have declined since the 1970s due to the growth of Associate Degree in Nursing and Bachelor of Science in Nursing programs at colleges and universities, as well as increasing financial constraints on hospitals and the healthcare systems. Diploma programs were the most abundant in the 1950s and 1960s, with nearly 1,300 diploma programs active nationwide.[7] Presently, less than 10 percent of nursing degree programs are diploma programs,[8] which produce less than 6 percent of registered nurses.[9] The majority of the remaining diploma programs in the United States are concentrated in the Midwest and on the East Coast.[10] Programs for hospital diplomas are traditionally sponsored and run by hospitals in the community, as their name implies. Courses are taught proximal to and in conjunction with the hospital, where students have practical application of their skills on the units and wards in the sponsoring facility. Diploma programs typically have a strong focus on practical application of skills, with a larger percentage of time spent on the “hands-on” component of learning. Students attend classes for two to three years, at the completion of which they take the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN) certifying exam, a standard exam for all practicing registered nurses. Students graduate with a diploma in nursing, and passing of the NCLEX-RN allows for certification and state licensure, which permits the graduate to practice as a full registered nurse within his or her state's statutes. Coursework taken in a diploma nursing program can frequently be used for credits toward nursing degrees such as a BSN or ADN.[11]\nAssociate Degree in Nursing\n[edit]An Associate Degree in Nursing (ADN) is the minimum educational requirement to become a registered nurse in the United States. All ADN prepared nurses are credentialed through individual state nursing boards after passing the NCLEX-RN. In order to be eligible to take the NCLEX-RN exam, candidates must have a high school diploma or its equivalent and a degree from a board of nursing approved nursing program. ADN nursing programs typically take two years to complete but courses required differ by state.[12] The standard course requirement includes anatomy, physiology, microbiology, chemistry, nutrition, psychology.[13] Background checks are also performed on all candidates prior to granting licensure. Associate degree nurses are able to work in both outpatient and inpatient settings.[14] Of the almost 3.1 million registered nurses in the United States, 36.1 percent of them have an associate degrees in nursing.[15]\nBachelor of Science Degree in Nursing\n[edit]Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degrees prepare nurses for a wide variety of professional roles and graduate study within nursing. It is typically acquired through a four-year program at a college or university. Baccalaureate programs include a variety of liberal arts courses and professional education and training in the nursing field. It contains additional education beyond that of an ADN that often includes physical and social sciences, communication, leadership, and critical thinking.[16] There are 674 BSN programs in the United States. BSN programs are approved by each state's individual board of nursing that allows students to sit for the NCLEX-RN examination to obtain a license as a registered nurse [17] Some states have accelerated programs called “RN-to-BSN” or “BSN completion” for registered nurses with associate degrees wanting to obtain their bachelor's degree in nursing. In 2010, the Institute of Medicine called for 80 percent of nurses in the U.S. to be baccalaureate trained by the year 2020, and this has created a push for healthcare organizations to make a BSN a hiring requirement for registered nurses and instituting education assistance programs for those with associate degrees.[18]\nMaster of Science Degree in Nursing\n[edit]The Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) is an advanced degree that allows for a more specialized role in nursing. The master's prepared nurse has a wide array of careers that he or she might aspire to fill. Career paths include certified nurse practitioner (CNP), certified nurse anesthetist (CRNA), clinical nurse specialist (CNS), or Certified Nurse‐Midwife (CNM). Some other areas the MSN prepared nurse might focus are in public health, business administration or health administration. Education curriculum may vary between 18 and 24 months of full-time graduate level studies, with program length determined by the specified field.[19] The certification exams for a master's prepared nurse are dependent upon the role being pursued. For example, the CNM takes the American Midwifery Certification Board exam and nurse administrators may receive their certification from the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC). Master's prepared nurses are trained in advanced assessment, counseling of patients, management, leadership, research and education.[20] They may work in both inpatient and outpatient settings as well as educational institutions, and scope of practice may vary state-by-state.\nDoctor of Nursing Practice Degree\n[edit]The scope of practice for a Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) includes assessing, diagnosing, prescribing, consulting, screening, educating, initiating referrals, and the coordination of patient care. There are numerous specialties DNPs may pursue including Acute Care Nurse Practitioner, Adult Nurse Practitioner, Adult-gerontology nurse practitioner (acute or primary care), Adult Psychiatric- Mental Health Nurse Practitioner, Family Nurse Practitioner, Gerontological Nurse Practitioner, Pediatric Nurse Practitioner (acute or primary care), and School Nurse Practitioner.[21] Specific practice guidelines can vary by state and area of practice.",
      "processed_content": "**Licensed Practical Nurse**\nThe education required for a Licensed Practical Nurse/Licensed Vocational Nurse is the completion of a 12-18 month program, typically at a technical college. The program focuses on task activities and prepares the nurse for the National Council Licensure Examination for Licensed Practical Nurses (NCLEX). LPN/LVNs work in a variety of settings including hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, rehabilitation centers, schools, and individual or group homes.\n\n**Hospital-Based Diploma Nurse**\nHospital-based Diplomas in Nursing were historically the primary form of nursing education, first appearing in the early 20th century. Diploma programs typically have a strong focus on practical application of skills, with a larger percentage of time spent on the “hands-on” component of learning. Students attend classes for two to three years, at the completion of which they take the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN) certifying exam, a standard exam for all practicing registered nurses.\n\n**Associate Degree in Nursing**\nAn Associate Degree in Nursing (ADN) is the minimum educational requirement to become a registered nurse in the United States. ADN nursing programs typically take two years to complete but courses required differ by state. Associate degree nurses are able to work in both outpatient and inpatient settings.\n\n**Bachelor of Science Degree in Nursing**\nBachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degrees prepare nurses for a wide variety of professional roles and graduate study within nursing. It is typically acquired through a four-year program at a college or university. Baccalaureate programs include a variety of liberal arts courses and professional education and training in the nursing field.\n\n**Master of Science Degree in Nursing**\nThe Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) is an advanced degree that allows for a more specialized role in nursing. Career paths include certified nurse practitioner (CNP), certified nurse anesthetist (CRNA), clinical nurse specialist (CNS), or Certified Nurse‐Midwife (CNM). Master's prepared nurses are trained in advanced assessment, counseling of patients, management, leadership, research and education.\n\n**Doctor of Nursing Practice Degree**\nThe scope of practice for a Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) includes assessing, diagnosing, prescribing, consulting, screening, educating, initiating referrals, and the coordination of patient care. Specific practice guidelines can vary by state and area of practice. In order to become a DNP, one would need to obtain his or her doctorate in nursing practice.\n\n**Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing**\nNurses who hold a Doctor of Philosophy Degree in Nursing (PhD), are less about hands-on patient care and more about the abstract thinking that helps move the profession forward. A nurse with a PhD has the training needed to conduct research aimed at changing nursing science or practice. PhD prepared nurses teach as academic faculty, conduct research, evaluate programs, hold academic and leadership positions, write books, and lead health care organizations.\n",

      "raw_content": "Bachelor of Science in Nursing\nThe Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN, BScN) also known in some countries as a Bachelor of Nursing (BN) or Bachelor of Science (BS) with a Major in Nursing is an academic degree in the science and principles of nursing, granted by an accredited tertiary education provider. The course of study is typically three or four years. The difference in degree designation may relate to the amount of basic science courses required as part of the degree, with BScN and BSN degree curriculums requiring completion of more courses on math and natural sciences that are more typical of BSc degrees (e.g. calculus, physics, chemistry, biology) and BN curriculums more focused on nursing theory, nursing process, and teaching versions of general science topics that are adapted to be more specific and relevant to nursing practice. Nursing school students are generally required to take courses in social and behavioral sciences and liberal arts, including nutrition, anatomy, chemistry, mathematics, and English. In addition to those courses, experience in physical and social sciences, communication, leadership, and critical thinking is required for a bachelor's degree.[1] BSN programs typically last 2–4 years. Someone who holds a BSN can work in private or public medical and surgical hospitals, physician's offices, home health care services, and nursing facilities. Having a BSN can result in more opportunities and better salary than just an associate degree.[2]\nThe bachelor's degree prepares nurses for a wide variety of professional roles and graduate study. Course work includes nursing science, research, leadership, and related areas that inform the practice of nursing. It also provides the student with general education in math, humanities and social sciences. An undergraduate degree affords opportunities for greater career advancement and higher salary options. It is often a prerequisite for teaching, administrative, consulting and research roles.[3]\nA Bachelor of Science in Nursing is not currently required for entry into professional nursing in all countries. In the US, there has been an effort for it to become the entry-level degree since 1964, when the American Nurses Association (ANA) advanced the position that the minimum preparation for beginning professional nursing practice should be a baccalaureate degree education in nursing.[4] The Institute of Medicine (IOM) affirmed in 2010 that nurses should achieve higher levels of education and training through an improved education system that promotes seamless academic progression.[5]\nIn the United States\n[edit]Accreditation\n[edit]The Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE)[6] and the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing (ACEN)[7] are the accreditation bodies for Bachelor of Science in Nursing programs in the United States. Both Commissions are officially recognized as national accreditation agencies that ensure quality standards for undergraduate to graduate nursing programs by the United States Secretary of Education.[7][6]\nAccelerated BSN programs\n[edit]Accelerated Bachelor of Science in Nursing programs allow those who already have a bachelor's degree in a non-nursing field to obtain their nursing degree at an accelerated rate, which is why they are also commonly referred to as \"Second Degree Nursing Programs.\" These programs usually have strict prerequisites because the program coursework focuses solely on nursing. Accelerated BSN programs are typically anywhere from 12 to 24 months.\nBSN Completion or \"RN to BSN\" Programs\n[edit]These programs are intended specifically for nurses with a diploma or associate degree in nursing who wish to \"top-up\" their current academic qualifications to a Bachelor of Science in Nursing. A majority of these RN to BSN programs are offered online through colleges, universities, or other e-learning providers. pro In order to keep the programs up-to-date and relevant to the current healthcare system, the course material is updated regularly with feedback from registered nurses, nurse managers, healthcare professionals and even patients.[8]\nBSN entry level into nursing in the future\n[edit]In 2011, The Institute of Medicine recommended that by 2020, 80 percent of RNs hold a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree.[9] This was also noted in a report titled: Institute of Medicine's report on the Future of Nursing, and has been followed by a campaign to implement its recommendations. In this report a 2nd recommendation was made to focus on increasing the proportion of registered nurses (RNs) with a baccalaureate degree to 80% by 2020. Towards that effort the report recommends that educational associations, colleges, delivery organizations, governmental organizations, and funders develop the resources necessary to support this goal. These recommendations are consistent with other policy initiatives currently underway; for example, legislation requiring that nurses receive a baccalaureate degree within 10 years of initial licensure has been considered in New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island.[10]\nMany of these recommendations are being driven by recent studies regarding patient outcomes and nursing education. Hospitals employing higher percentages of BSN-prepared nurses have shown an associated decrease in morbidity, mortality, and failure-to-rescue rates. Increasing the percentage of BSN nurses employed decreases by 10 percent the 30-day inpatient mortality and failure-to-rescue rates.[9] Studies that provide this type of evidence-based practice encompass the ultimate purpose of a higher level of educated nurse workforce. It adds to support the ultimate mission of the Texas Board of Nursing (BON or Board), which is to protect and promote the welfare of the people of Texas by ensuring that each person holding a license as a nurse in this state is competent to practice safely.[11]\nMany healthcare leaders and institutions have increased expectations for evidence-based practice (EBP). The Institute of Medicine (IOM) aim was for 90% of clinical decisions to be evidence-based by 2020 (IOM, 2010).[12]\nSee also\n[edit]- Associate of Science in Nursing\n- Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education\n- Diploma in Nursing\n- Doctor of Nursing Practice\n- Master of Science in Nursing\n- National League for Nursing Accrediting Commission\n- Nurse education\n- Nursing school\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ \"How to Become a Registered Nurse\".

      "raw_content": "Public health\nPublic health is \"the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health through the organized efforts and informed choices of society, organizations, public and private, communities and individuals\".[1][2] Analyzing the determinants of health of a population and the threats it faces is the basis for public health.[3] The public can be as small as a handful of people or as large as a village or an entire city; in the case of a pandemic it may encompass several continents. The concept of health takes into account physical, psychological, and social well-being, among other factors.[4]\nPublic health is an interdisciplinary field. For example, epidemiology, biostatistics, social sciences and management of health services are all relevant. Other important sub-fields include environmental health, community health, behavioral health, health economics, public policy, mental health, health education, health politics, occupational safety, disability, oral health, gender issues in health, and sexual and reproductive health.[5] Public health, together with primary care, secondary care, and tertiary care, is part of a country's overall healthcare system. Public health is implemented through the surveillance of cases and health indicators, and through the promotion of healthy behaviors. Common public health initiatives include promotion of hand-washing and breastfeeding, delivery of vaccinations, promoting ventilation and improved air quality both indoors and outdoors, suicide prevention, smoking cessation, obesity education, increasing healthcare accessibility and distribution of condoms to control the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.\nThere is a significant disparity in access to health care and public health initiatives between developed countries and developing countries, as well as within developing countries. In developing countries, public health infrastructures are still forming. There may not be enough trained healthcare workers, monetary resources, or, in some cases, sufficient knowledge to provide even a basic level of medical care and disease prevention.[6][7] A major public health concern in developing countries is poor maternal and child health, exacerbated by malnutrition and poverty coupled with governments' reluctance in implementing public health policies. Developed nations are at greater risk of certain public health crises, including childhood obesity, although overweight populations in low- and middle-income countries are catching up.[8]\nFrom the beginnings of human civilization, communities promoted health and fought disease at the population level.[9][10] In complex, pre-industrialized societies, interventions designed to reduce health risks could be the initiative of different stakeholders, such as army generals, the clergy or rulers. Great Britain became a leader in the development of public health initiatives, beginning in the 19th century, due to the fact that it was the first modern urban nation worldwide.[11] The public health initiatives that began to emerge initially focused on sanitation (for example, the Liverpool and London sewerage systems), control of infectious diseases (including vaccination and quarantine) and an evolving infrastructure of various sciences, e.g. statistics, microbiology, epidemiology, sciences of engineering.[11]\nDefinition\n[edit]Public health has been defined as \"the science and art of preventing disease\", prolonging life and improving quality of life through organized efforts and informed choices of society, organizations (public and private), communities and individuals.[2] The public can be as small as a handful of people or as large as a village or an entire city. The concept of health takes into account physical, psychological, and social well-being. As such, according to the World Health Organization, \"health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\".[4]\nRelated terms\n[edit]Public health is related to global health which is the health of populations in the worldwide context.[12] It has been defined as \"the area of study, research and practice that places a priority on improving health and achieving equity in \"Health for all\" people worldwide\".[13] International health is a field of health care, usually with a public health emphasis, dealing with health across regional or national boundaries.[14] Public health is not the same as public healthcare (publicly funded health care).\nThe term preventive medicine is related to public health. The American Board of Preventive Medicine separates three categories of preventive medicine: aerospace health, occupational health, and public health and general preventative medicine. Jung, Boris and Lushniak argue that preventive medicine should be considered the medical specialty for public health but note that the American College of Preventive Medicine and American Board of Preventive Medicine do not prominently use the term \"public health\".[15]: 1 Preventive medicine specialists are trained as clinicians and address complex health needs of a population such as by assessing the need for disease prevention programs, using the best methods to implement them, and assessing their effectiveness.[15]: 1, 3\nSince the 1990s many scholars in public health have been using the term population health.[16]: 3 There are no medical specialties directly related to population health.[15]: 4 Valles argues that consideration of health equity is a fundamental part of population health. Scholars such as Coggon and Pielke express concerns about bringing general issues of wealth distribution into population health. Pielke worries about \"stealth issue advocacy\" in population health.[16]: 163 Jung, Boris and Lushniak consider population health to be a concept that is the goal of an activity called public health practiced through the specialty preventive medicine.[15]: 4\nLifestyle medicine uses individual lifestyle modification to prevent or revert disease and can be considered a component of preventive medicine and public health. It is implemented as part of primary care rather than a specialty in its own right.[15]: 3 Valles argues that the term social medicine has a narrower and more biomedical focus than the term population health.[16]: 7\nPurpose\n[edit]The purpose of a public health intervention is to prevent and mitigate diseases, injuries, and other health conditions. The overall goal is to improve the health of individuals and populations, and to increase life expectancy.[17][18]\nComponents\n[edit]Public health is a complex term, composed of many elements and different practices. It is a multi-faceted, interdisciplinary field.[11] For example, epidemiology, biostatistics, social sciences and management of health services are all relevant. Other important sub-fields include environmental health, community health, behavioral health, health economics, public policy, mental health, health education, health politics, occupational safety, disability, gender issues in health, and sexual and reproductive health.[5]\nModern public health practice requires multidisciplinary teams of public health workers and professionals. Teams might include epidemiologists, biostatisticians, physician assistants, public health nurses, midwives, medical microbiologists, pharmacists, economists, sociologists, geneticists, data managers, environmental health officers (public health inspectors), bioethicists, gender experts, sexual and reproductive health specialists, physicians, and veterinarians.[19]\nThe elements and priorities of public health have evolved over time, and are continuing to evolve.[11] Common public health initiatives include promotion of hand-washing and breastfeeding, delivery of vaccinations, suicide prevention, smoking cessation, obesity education, increasing healthcare accessibility and distribution of condoms to control the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.",

Public health includes such parts as epidemiology,[2][3][4][5][6][7][8] biostatistics,[9] health services, environmental, social, behavioral, and occupational health.[10]\nPublic health intervention prevents rather than treats a disease through surveillance of cases and promotes healthy behaviors such as hand washing, vaccination programs and distribution of condoms. In outbreaks of an infectious disease, treating a disease may be vital to preventing it in others.\nMost countries have their own government public health agencies, sometimes known as ministries of health, to respond to domestic health issues. Many diseases are preventable through simple, non-medical methods. Public health plays an important role in disease prevention efforts in the developing world and in developed countries, through local health systems and through international non-governmental organizations. In the developing world, there may not be enough trained health workers or monetary resources to provide a basic level of medical care and disease prevention.\nHistory of public health\n[change | change source]Public health has roots in antiquity. From the beginning, human civilization recognized that polluted water and lack of proper waste disposal spread communicable diseases. Early religions attempted to regulate behavior related to health, from types of food eaten, to behaviors, such as drinking alcohol or sexual relationships. Governments placed responsibility on leaders to develop public health policies and programs in order to gain some understanding of the causes of disease, ensure social stability prosperity, and maintain order.\nThe Chinese developed the practice of variolation following a smallpox epidemic around 1000 BC. The practice of vaccination did not become prevalent until the 1820s. During the 14th century Black Death in Europe,[11][12] burning parts of cities resulted in benefit, since it destroyed the rodent infestations. The development of quarantine in the medieval period restricted effects of other infectious diseases.\nLater people started building sewers and irrigation, the regular collection of garbage, incineration or disposal, providing clean water and draining standing water to prevent the breeding of mosquitos. The industrial revolution initially caused the spread of disease through large conurbations around workhouses and factories.\nModern public health\n[change | change source]The increase in average life span in the 20th century is credited to public health achievements, such as vaccination programs and control of infectious diseases, effective safety policies of motor vehicle and occupational safety, improved family planning,[13] smoke-free measures, and programs on decreasing chronic disease such as cancer, heart disease and more physical exercise.\nSometimes, the developing world is affected by largely preventable infectious diseases, due to malnutrition and poverty. The focus of public health has moved from individual behaviors and risk factors to population-level issues such as inequality, poverty, and education. There is recognition that our health is affected by where we live, genetics, our income, our educational status and our social relationships.\nEngland\n[change | change source]Public health in England is mostly run by local government since 2012.[14] They pay for\n- health visitors and school nurses\n- drug and alcohol addition treatment\n- Raising awareness for other substance use, such as smoking\n- sexual health services\n- physical activity\n- suicide prevention\n- health protection\nEducation and training\n[change | change source]Schools of public health offer:\n- Professional degrees are oriented towards practice in public health settings: the Master of Public Health (M.P.H.),[15][16][17][18][19] Doctor of Public Health (Dr.PH.)[20][21] and the Master of Health Administration (M.H.A.). They deal with public health in health departments, managed care and community-based organizations, hospitals and consulting firms.\n- Academic degrees are oriented towards the scientific basis of public health and preventive medicine,[22] research, university teaching in graduate schools, policy analysis and development, and other high-level public health positions. Examples of academic degrees are the Master of Science (M.S.), Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), and Doctor of Science (Sc.D.).\nPublic health programs\n[change | change source]Most governments recognize the importance of public health programs in reducing the incidence of disease, disability, and the effects of aging, although public health generally receives significantly less government funding compared with medicine. In recent years, public health programs providing vaccinations have made strides in promoting health, including the eradication of smallpox.\nAn important public health issues facing the world currently are HIV/AIDS, antibiotic resistance, leading to the re-emergence of diseases such as Tuberculosis,[23] diabetes.[24][25][26][27] As non-communicable diseases caused by smoking have been threatening public health, public health started controlling smoking. The global health system needs to find a way to even out communicable and non communicable diseases. Many nations have implemented major initiatives to cut smoking, such as increased taxation and bans on smoking in some or all public places.\nReferences\n[change | change source]- ↑ Detels, R., Beaglehole, R., Lansang, M.

      "raw_content": "Public health journal\nA public health journal is a scientific journal devoted to the field of public health, including epidemiology, biostatistics, and health care (including medicine, nursing and related fields). Public health journals, like most scientific journals, are peer-reviewed. Public health journals are commonly published by health organizations and societies, such as the Bulletin of the World Health Organization or the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (published by the British Medical Association). Many others are published by a handful of large publishing corporations that includes Elsevier, Wolters Kluwer, Wiley-Blackwell, Springer Science+Business Media, and Informa, each of which has many imprints (which are brands named after former independent publishers that were merged or acquired). Many societies partner with such corporations to handle the work of producing their journals.\nThe increase in public health research in recent decades has seen a rapid increase in the number of articles and journals. As such, many public health journals have emerged with a specialized focus, such as in the area of policy (e.g. Journal of Public Health Policy), a specific region or country of the world (e.g. Asia-Pacific Journal of Public Health, Pan American Journal of Public Health or Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal), a specific intervention/practice area (e.g. Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention), or other particular focus (e.g. Human Resources for Health).\nScope\n[edit]Public health journals often indicate their target audience as being interdisciplinary, including health care professionals, public health decision-makers and researchers. A main objective is to support evidence-based policy and evidence-based practice in public health.[1][2][3] In contrast, medical journals (e.g. The Lancet) typically focus on reaching medical professionals as their main audience, although the boundaries between these two categories are increasingly blurry.\nIt has been argued that some medical and public health journals are \"filled with increasingly complex science\" which depends upon advanced statistics and research methods that health care providers may have difficulty understanding. In response they have turned towards publishing \"articles that are more journalism than science\" such as reviews, news, and educational material.[4] However, science is what attracts major attention and leads institutions and libraries to purchase subscriptions.[4]\nReview process\n[edit]For an article to be accepted for publication in a public health or medical journal it must typically undergo a review process. Each journal creates its own process, but they have certain common characteristics in general. There are various general \"levels\" of scrutiny, which have some effect on the respect given to articles published in the journals. Some broad categories might be editorial review, peer review, and blind peer review. Richard Smith, former editor of the British Medical Journal, stated in 2006 that studies had found peer review to be ineffective and prone to abuse, but noted that editors consider it invaluable.[4]\nEditorial review\n[edit]In this process, articles which meet the minimum requirements for submission (such as including the necessary descriptions of funding, privacy and publication releases, ethics/institutional review board approval, statements of original work, signatures of authors, and so on,) are first looked over by a managing editor or a member of an editorial board. They may be referred back to the authors for revision and resubmission, rejected, or presented to the editorial board for final approval.\nPeer review\n[edit]A more stringent review process includes a full peer review. After first review by a managing editor or member of an editorial board, an article which has good possibilities will be sent out for review by two or more researchers in the specific area. If these reviews are positive the article may be referred back to the authors to address any comments by the reviewers, or (rarely) may be accepted immediately by the editorial board.\nBlind peer review\n[edit]One common review process is the same as the peer review above, except all references to the authors are removed from the article before review by the researchers.\nContent\n[edit]Most public health journals include various types of content, such as:\n- Editorial\n- Letter to the Editor\n- Original research\n- Literature review, systematic review and meta-analysis\n- Abstracts from scientific meetings or other journals\n- Technical notes\nMedical journals may also include, for example, case reports and clinical images of interest. Some online journals are also moving to publishing video content (e.g. Journal of Visualized Experiments).\nInternet and open access\n[edit]By the early 21st century, most public health and medical journals were available online, thus increasing their accessibility worldwide. There is a general move from print as primary medium to electronic publication, an example being the online journals published by BioMed Central.\nWith the advent of online publication, some health journals are transforming from traditional subscription-based and pay-per-view access to open access for some or all of their content.\nImpact factor\n[edit]Like other scientific journals, many public health journals are ranked with an impact factor, linked to the probability of an article published in that journal being cited. It is currently accepted that a higher impact factor indicates a better journal quality, at least in some health disciplines.[5]\nJournals with high impact factors according to the Journal Citation Reports in the category \"Public, Environmental and Occupational Health\" include: Environmental Health Perspectives, American Journal of Epidemiology, Annual Review of Public Health, Genetic Epidemiology, Epidemiologic Reviews, Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, International Journal of Epidemiology, Epidemiology, Bulletin of the World Health Organization and American Journal of Public Health.[6][7]\nIn addition, given their interdisciplinary nature, some journals with a public health focus may be found in other categories. For example, Human Resources for Health is placed in the category \"industrial relations and labor\", where it was ranked 1st in 2012.\nSee also\n[edit]- Biomedical research\n- Health services research\n- List of medical journals\n- List of nursing journals\n- Medical literature\n- National public health institutes\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ World Health Organization.

      "raw_content": "Social science\nSocial science (often rendered in the plural as the social sciences) is one of the branches of science, devoted to the study of societies and the relationships among members within those societies. The term was formerly used to refer to the field of sociology, the original \"science of society\", established in the 18th century. In addition to sociology, it now encompasses a wide array of academic disciplines, including anthropology, archaeology, economics, geography, history, linguistics, management, communication studies, psychology, culturology, and political science.[1]\nPositivist social scientists use methods resembling those used in the natural sciences as tools for understanding societies, and so define science in its stricter modern sense. Interpretivist or speculative social scientists, by contrast, may use social critique or symbolic interpretation rather than constructing empirically falsifiable theories, and thus treat science in its broader sense.[2] In modern academic practice, researchers are often eclectic, using multiple methodologies (for instance, by combining both quantitative and qualitative research).[3] The term social research has also acquired a degree of autonomy as practitioners from various disciplines share similar goals and methods.[4]\nHistory\n[edit]The history of the social sciences began in the Age of Enlightenment after 1651,[5] which saw a revolution within natural philosophy, changing the basic framework by which individuals understood what was scientific. Social sciences came forth from the moral philosophy of the time and were influenced by the Age of Revolutions, such as the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution.[6] The social sciences developed from the sciences (experimental and applied), or the systematic knowledge-bases or prescriptive practices, relating to the social improvement of a group of interacting entities.[7][8]\nThe beginnings of the social sciences in the 18th century are reflected in the grand encyclopedia of Diderot, with articles from Jean-Jacques Rousseau and other pioneers. The growth of the social sciences is also reflected in other specialized encyclopedias. The term \"social science\" was coined in French by Mirabeau in 1767, before becoming a distinct conceptual field in the nineteenth century.[9] Social science was influenced by positivism,[6] focusing on knowledge based on actual positive sense experience and avoiding the negative; metaphysical speculation was avoided. Auguste Comte used the term science sociale to describe the field, taken from the ideas of Charles Fourier; Comte also referred to the field as social physics.[6][10]\nFollowing this period, five paths of development sprang forth in the social sciences, influenced by Comte in other fields.[6] One route that was taken was the rise of social research. Large statistical surveys were undertaken in various parts of the United States and Europe. Another route undertaken was initiated by Émile Durkheim, studying \"social facts\", and Vilfredo Pareto, opening metatheoretical ideas and individual theories. A third means developed, arising from the methodological dichotomy present, in which social phenomena were identified with and understood; this was championed by figures such as Max Weber.[11] The fourth route taken, based in economics, was developed and furthered economic knowledge as a hard science. The last path was the correlation of knowledge and social values; the antipositivism and verstehen sociology of Max Weber firmly demanded this distinction. In this route, theory (description) and prescription were non-overlapping formal discussions of a subject.[12][13]\nThe foundation of social sciences in the West implies conditioned relationships between progressive and traditional spheres of knowledge. In some contexts, such as the Italian one, sociology slowly affirms itself and experiences the difficulty of affirming a strategic knowledge beyond philosophy and theology.[14]\nAround the start of the 20th century, Enlightenment philosophy was challenged in various quarters. After the use of classical theories since the end of the scientific revolution, various fields substituted mathematics studies for experimental studies and examining equations to build a theoretical structure. The development of social science subfields became very quantitative in methodology. The interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary nature of scientific inquiry into human behaviour, social and environmental factors affecting it, made many of the natural sciences interested in some aspects of social science methodology.[15] Examples of boundary blurring include emerging disciplines like social research of medicine, sociobiology, neuropsychology, bioeconomics and the history and sociology of science. Increasingly, quantitative research and qualitative methods are being integrated in the study of human action and its implications and consequences. In the first half of the 20th century, statistics became a free-standing discipline of applied mathematics.[16] Statistical methods were used confidently.\nIn the contemporary period, Karl Popper and Talcott Parsons influenced the furtherance of the social sciences.[6] Researchers continue to search for a unified consensus on what methodology might have the power and refinement to connect a proposed \"grand theory\" with the various midrange theories that, with considerable success, continue to provide usable frameworks for massive, growing data banks; for more, see consilience. The social sciences will for the foreseeable future be composed of different zones in the research of, and sometimes distinct in approach toward, the field.[6]\nThe term \"social science\" may refer either to the specific sciences of society established by thinkers such as Comte, Durkheim, Marx, and Weber, or more generally to all disciplines outside of \"noble science\" and arts. By the late 19th century, the academic social sciences were constituted of five fields: jurisprudence and amendment of the law, education, health, economy and trade, and art.[7]\nAround the start of the 21st century, the expanding domain of economics in the social sciences has been described as economic imperialism.[17]\nA distinction is usually drawn between the social sciences and the humanities. Classicist Allan Bloom writes in The Closing of the American Mind (1987):\nSocial science and humanities have a mutual contempt for one another, the former looking down on the latter as unscientific, the latter regarding the former as philistine. […] The difference comes down to the fact that social science really wants to be predictive, meaning that man is predictable, while the humanities say that he is not.[18]\nBranches\n[edit]The social science disciplines are branches of knowledge taught and researched at the college or university level. Social science disciplines are defined and recognized by the academic journals in which research is published, and the learned social science societies and academic departments or faculties to which their practitioners belong. Social science fields of study usually have several sub-disciplines or branches, and the distinguishing lines between these are often both arbitrary and ambiguous.",

Social science seeks to understand the evolving human systems across our increasingly complex world and how our planet can be more sustainably managed. It’s vital to our shared future.\nSocial science includes many different areas of study, such as how people they organise and govern themselves, and broker power and international relations; how wealth is generated, economies develop, and economic futures are modelled; how business works and what a sustainable future means; the ways in which populations are changing, and issues of unemployment, deprivation and inequality; and how these social, cultural and economic dynamics vary in different places, with different outcomes.\nDid you know…\n-\nPopular A Levels\nOf the 12 most popular A level subjects, five are social sciences: business studies; economics; geography; psychology; sociology.\n-\nIn demand\nAround 40% (>230,000) of new undergrad students chose to study social science subjects at UK universities in 2020-2021. Social sciences are in demand.\n-\nWell paid\nSocial science graduates are well paid. Many earn as much as STEM graduates.\n-\nVital to business\nSocial science knowledge and skills from leadership and strategic planning to international liaison, sustainability, consumer growth, marketing, legal and financial management are vital to business.\n-\nRelevant\nIn a recent survey, two thirds of the research questions the UK government sought answers to centred on social science.\n-\nInspiring\nSocial science helps us make sense of our changing human world, inspiring us to be culturally sensitive, environmentally aware and socially responsible citizens.\nSocial Science Disciplines\nSocial science comprises 16 major disciplines and many sub-disciplines and specialisms. Find out about each and how they help us understand our contemporary human world.\n-\nAnthropology is the study, generally using ethnographic methods, of how different groups of people create and give meaning to their social world – ‘society’ – and how that social world places constraints on their behaviour and relationships. It is interested in what societies have in common, what differentiates them and how they change.\n-\nThis is an interdisciplinary field including accounting, EDI, ethics, finance, HR, information systems, leadership, marketing, operations, organisational behaviour and strategy. It includes qualitative and quantitative analyses of individuals, organisations, systems, change and the role of organisations and management in society, environment and economy.\n-\nDemography is the study of human populations. Demographers and social statisticians use social statistics and demographic methods to analyse the influences on population structures and dynamics, such as population growth, fertility, mortality, ageing and migration patterns. The discipline supports social policy-making at all scales that requires sound demographic analysis for decision-making.\n-\nDevelopment Studies investigates global, national and local processes of change, including social, economic, political, cultural, environmental and technological. It focuses largely on contexts characterised by poverty, inequalities, environmental vulnerability and socio-political conflict and involves the critical interrogation of development theories, structures, processes, policies and practices from multiple disciplinary perspectives.\n-\nHuman beings interact with the physical world and each other to produce artefacts and services that support and enhance their lives – offering usefulness and pleasure. Economics is the study of the principles, laws and dynamics that drive these economic processes; about how such wealth is created and subsequently distributed.\n-\nEducation is the study of learning, teaching and human development. A well-established discipline in universities, it also has strong multi-disciplinary links for example with sociology, psychology, and philosophy. The study of education in society, including the practice and policy of early years settings, schools, colleges and teacher education, is an important aspect.\n-\nPeople, places and environments are central to our lives. Geographers explore the interactions between them, globally and locally. Analysing and understanding the dynamics of cultures, societies and economies, how they vary between places, and why differences and inequalities exist, inform some of the big issues facing society today.\n-\nInternational Relations focuses on interactions of states and non-state actors through the tools of diplomacy, trade, and violence. Pressing questions including climate change and migration are analysed at local and global levels. Attention is paid to how gender, race, and sexuality are affected by and shape responses to these challenges.\n-\nLeisure studies examine issues related to leisure, including recreation, tourism, events, and sport. It includes studies of individuals and the relationship between leisure and wider society. It draws on scholars with backgrounds in many different social science disciplines, including economics, sociology, geography, psychology, planning, sports science, and recreation management.\n-\nLanguage is central to social interaction. Linguistics, and applied linguistics in particular, offers insights, often based on millions of words of data, into questions such as how language is used to inform, persuade and mislead – e.g. in business, healthcare and security contexts -and how we learn an additional language.\n-\nSpace and place matter to us all. Planning is about creating efficient and equitable places. It is about helping to make communities that are socially inclusive, economically competitive and environmentally sustainable. Planners are at the heart of efforts to address the climate emergency, reduce regional inequalities and overcome housing shortages.\n-\nFrom democracy to dictatorship and local councils to international organisations, the study of politics examines how power is obtained, kept, lost, mobilised, divided, used and abused. It asks who gains and who loses from these processes, and why. Politics is studied in theory and practice, sometimes using scientific methods.\n-\nPsychology is the scientific study of the mind and how it influences our behaviour, from communication and memory to thought and emotion. It is both an academic discipline and a vital clinical practice, examining human behaviour, thoughts and feelings through observation, measurement, and testing.\n-\nRegional Studies is interdisciplinary and concerns with the analysis of sub-national regions and regional issues. It investigates how and why regions and cities develop. It seeks to understand how economic and political processes are influenced by regional and local circumstances and vice versa.\n-\nThe study of society, and the ways that social life is organised, structured, and experienced. Focusing on big issues such as inequality, poverty, crime, racism and climate change, and exploring how we make sense of, navigate and change our interpersonal and everyday lives, sociology combines the study of self and society.\n-\nStatistics underpin many other disciplines. They help us understand and quantify what is happening in society and the economy, and provide the methods and tools to help researchers of all kinds collect, analyse and interpret data.\nThe We Society Podcast\nTackling the big questions through a social science lens, the We Society Podcast brings you some of the best ideas to shape the way we live.\nJoin acclaimed journalist and Academy president Will Hutton, as he invites guests from the world of social science to explore the stories behind the news and hear their solutions to society’s most pressing problems.",

      "raw_content": "What Is Social Science?\nSocial science is the study of how people interact with one another. The branches of social science include anthropology, economics, political science, psychology, and sociology.\nSocial scientists study how societies work, exploring everything from the triggers of economic growth and the causes of unemployment to what makes people happy. Their findings inform public policies, education programs, urban design, marketing strategies, and many other endeavors.\nKey Takeaways\n- Social science involves academic disciplines that focus on how individuals behave within society.\n- It attempts to explain how society works, exploring everything from the triggers of economic growth and causes of unemployment to what makes people happy.\n- Social science is a relatively new field of scientific study that rose to prominence in the 20th century.\n- Typical careers in social science include working as an advertiser, economist, psychologist, teacher, manager, and social worker.\n- Social scientists generally rely more heavily on interpretation and qualitative research methodologies than those in the natural sciences do.\nUnderstanding Social Science\nSocial science as a field of study is separate from the natural sciences, which covers topics such as physics, biology, and chemistry.\nSocial science examines the relationships between individuals and societies as well as the development and operation of societies, rather than focusing on the physical world. The academic disciplines involved in the social sciences rely more heavily on interpretation and qualitative research methodologies than do the natural sciences.\nThere are many fields within social science. The five main ones are anthropology, economics, political science, psychology, and sociology, although some people also include history, criminology, and geography.\nBranches of Social Science\nOpinions vary on which branches of study are included under social science. However, most observers agree that the following five fields fall into the category:\n- Anthropology\n- Economics\n- Political science\n- Sociology\n- Social psychology\nHistory is also sometimes regarded as a branch of social science, although many historians often consider the subject to share closer links to the humanities. Both humanities and social science study human beings. What separates them is the technique applied: Humanities are viewed as more philosophical and less scientific. Law, too, has some ties to social science, as does geography.\nAnthropology\nAnthropology, the study of the origin and development of human societies and cultures, has been a focal point for centuries. The field gained importance in Europe's Age of Enlightenment, which flourished in the 17th and 18th centuries. During that period, there was a pronounced focus on advancing society and knowledge, and understanding human behavior was seen as a key to achieving that goal.\nEconomics\nThe history of economic thought goes back all the way to ancient Greek philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, and Xenophon. Their works laid the foundation of nearly all social science, economics included.\nAs travel became easier in the 15th to 18th centuries, and more nations were able to partake in international trade, the economic system of mercantilism grew. The economic actions of many nations were suddenly motivated by the belief that a country should maximize exports and minimize imports.\nThis predominating school of thought was challenged by writers such as Adam Smith, commonly known as the father of modern economics. Smith’s ideas, along with those of Rousseau and John Locke, promoted the idea of a self-regulating economy and introduced the concept of what is known as classical economics. Smith’s book The Wealth of Nations is still studied today and admired by many politicians.\nTwo other important economists who have shaped the way we think of economics are Karl Marx and John Maynard Keynes. Marx famously challenged capitalism as an appropriate economic model by placing an emphasis on the labor theory of value. While Marx’s ideas are by no means widely endorsed by most of today’s politicians, his critique of capitalism has had a huge impact on many thinkers.\nThe Keynesian school of economics, meanwhile, is very popular among today’s economists. Keynesian economics is considered a demand-side macroeconomic theory that focuses on changes in the economy over the short run. It was the first to separate the study of economic behavior and markets based on individual incentives from the study of broad national economic aggregate variables and constructs.\nPolitical Science\nThe origins of political science can be traced back to ancient Greece. Back then, the philosopher Plato wrote various dialogues about politics, justice, and what constitutes good government.\nPlato’s early contributions would gradually take on a more scientific approach, led by thinkers including Aristotle, Thomas Hobbes, Marx, and Max Weber. Centuries of research into politics helped to boost democracy and assist politicians in making popular policy choices and get voted into power.\nPsychology\nPsychology is one of the fastest growing fields of social science. It began as a medical field of study in the late 1800s and grew popular in the Western world throughout the 20th century, thanks in part to the work of Sigmund Freud.\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 20.3% of adults had received some form of mental health treatment in 2020. Although many still use psychiatric medicine to treat their mental health issues, more people in recent years are seeking alternative treatments, such as mindfulness training and yoga in addition to traditional talk therapy.\nNeuroscience, drug treatments, and a growing variety of approaches to psychotherapy are adding to the options for psychological treatment. Research on animal learning, social psychology, and economic psychology are other branches of the field.\nSociology\nSociology as a science developed in Europe in the mid-1800s, a period of rapid social change. Political revolutions and the Industrial Revolution drastically altered how many people lived, which wasn't always for the better. This prompted early sociologists to wonder how to maintain stability when so much in life was shifting so fast.\nThe first sociology course in the U.S. was taught at Yale University by 1875. In the years that followed, other colleges added sociology to the curriculum and the subject arrived in high schools in 1911.\nSocial Science in Schools\nIn the United States, education in the social sciences begins in elementary school and progresses throughout middle and high school. There is an emphasis on aspects of core social sciences such as economics and political science. At the collegiate level, more specialized disciplines are offered.\nNowadays, colleges and universities offer numerous social science programs. For example, the University of California, Berkeley has 15 academic departments categorized as social sciences. They are:\n- African American studies\n- Anthropology\n- Cognitive science\n- Demography\n- Economics\n- Ethnic studies\n- Gender and women’s studies\n- Geography\n- Global studies\n- History\n- Linguistics\n- Political economy\n- Political science\n- Psychology\n- Sociology\nMaster’s degree and Ph.D. programs at colleges and universities offer opportunities for deeper specialization.\nEconomists and social workers are among the most sought-after employees in the U.S., according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).\nSocial Science Careers\nTypical careers in social science include working as an advertiser, psychologist, teacher, lawyer, manager, social worker, and economist.\nThe subject matter of social science—human behavior, relationships, attitudes, and how these things have changed over time—is useful information for any successful business to possess.",

It was envisaged in the 1920s by scholars working in disciplines which increasingly were coming to be known as \"human sciences\" or \"social sciences\". The goal was to create a comprehensive synthesis of the study of human affairs as undertaken by practitioners of all fields involved in such study. The parameters of what would come to be known as \"social science\" were in many ways initially established and defined by this publication.\nThe Encyclopaedia's founding organizations included the American Anthropological Association, the American Association of Social Workers, the American Economic Association, the American Historical Association, the American Political Science Association, the American Psychological Association, the American Sociological Society, the American Statistical Association, the Association of American Law Schools, and the National Education Association. It was edited by American economists Edwin Robert Anderson Seligman and Alvin Saunders Johnson. Seligman and Johnson solicited contributions from many of the most known and respected scholars in their fields, and established many links with European scholars in the process. The Rockefeller Foundation, Carnegie Foundation, and Russell Sage Foundation provided initial financial support, and Macmillan was selected as publisher.[1][2][3]\nThe international network of social scientists developed in the process of creating the Encyclopaedia would prove especially important during the Nazi occupation of Europe, during which many contributing scholars fled persecution for their ideas. Under Johnson's invitation, several of these scholars would come to New York City and form the \"University in Exile\", a specialized graduate school now known as the New School for Social Research.[4][5]\nThe Encyclopaedia was last printed in 1967, then in its 16th edition. It was succeeded by the International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences, edited by David L. Sills, and also published by Macmillan.[1]\nSee also\n[edit]- List of encyclopedias by branch of knowledge\n- International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences (1968)\n- International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences (2001)\nNotes\n[edit]- ^ a b Encyclopaedia of Social Sciences, Inc.
