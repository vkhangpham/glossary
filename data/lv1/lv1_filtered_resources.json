Others suggest that the main purpose of comparative politics is to provide an understanding of how and why different societies develop different kinds of political institutions. Still others use comparative politics as a way of discovering general laws and theories that will explain human political behavior and its variability.\n\nInternational Relations:\nThe field of international relations is concerned with developing an understanding of why states and non-state international actors, like the United Nations and multinational corporations, interact as they do. International conflict, particularly war, continues to be an important focus of the field. As the world has become more interdependent, scholars have become more aware of the importance of international economic activity.\n\nAmerican Government and Politics:\nStudents of American government and politics seek an understanding of politics as practiced in the United States.
