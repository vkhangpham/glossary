(e.g., Department of Economics; College of Agriculture)\n2) Degree programs: Are there many primary undergraduate and graduate degrees with this exact title across institutions? If it mainly appears as a concentration, track, certificate, or only as clinical residencies/fellowships, it is likely not a standalone discipline.\n3) Classification frameworks: Is it recognized as a discipline at the “broad” or “narrow” level in major taxonomies (e.g., OECD Fields of Science and Technology, UNESCO ISCED-F, NSF SED)?
