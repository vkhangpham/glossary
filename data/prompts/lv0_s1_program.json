      "instructions": "Task: Extract academic concepts (disciplines/fields of study) from college/department/school names.\n\nInput:\n- You will receive a list under the key \"sources\", where each item is one unit name string (e.g., \"Department of Urban and Regional Planning\").\n\nOutput:\n- Return exactly one Python-like list assignment:\n  extractions=[ConceptExtraction(source='<exact input string 1>', concepts=[<lowercased concept strings>]), ConceptExtraction(source='<exact input string 2>', concepts=[...]), ...]\n- Use the source string exactly as provided for each ConceptExtraction(source=...).\n- Do not include any other text (no reasoning, no headers).\n\nConcept extraction rules:\n- Extract only the academic disciplines/fields present in the name; ignore organizational type and location.\n  - Remove/ignore institutional/unit terms such as: department, school, college, division, program, centre/center, institute, faculty, office, unit, academy, laboratory, lab, \"of\"/\"for\" when they introduce the unit type (e.g., \"Department of\", \"School of\", \"Institute for\").\n- Concepts must be lowercase. This is critical. Example: \"Cell Biology\" -> \"cell biology\".\n- Keep the wording and plurality of the field as it appears (just lowercased). Do not lemmatize, singularize, or expand abbreviations.\n- Split multiple disciplines joined by conjunctions or punctuation:\n  - Split on \"and\", \"&\", \"/\", and commas when they enumerate separate fields.\n  - Shared-head expansion: If the final coordinated term provides a clear head noun that applies to earlier modifiers, attach that head noun to earlier conjuncts:\n    - \"urban and regional planning\" -> \"urban planning\", \"regional planning\"\n    - \"electrical and computer engineering\" -> \"electrical engineering\", \"computer engineering\"\n    - \"biochemistry and molecular biology\" -> \"biochemistry\", \"molecular biology\"\n  - Do NOT force a head noun when earlier conjuncts already stand alone as fields:\n    - \"journalism and mass communication\" -> \"journalism\", \"mass communication\" (do not create \"journalism communication\")\n  - When no clear shared head applies, keep each conjunct as it appears:\n    - \"health and human performance\" -> \"health\", \"human performance\"\n- Keep internal prepositions that are part of the field name (e.g., \"history of art\" stays \"history of art\").\n- Preserve multi-word fields as a single concept (e.g., \"slavic studies\", \"computational science\").\n- Maintain the left-to-right order of concepts as they appear in the name.\n- Deduplicate concepts within a source and trim whitespace.\n\nExamples (inputs -> concepts):\n- \"Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology\" -> [\"anatomy\", \"cell biology\"]\n- \"Department of Urban and Regional Planning\" -> [\"urban planning\", \"regional planning\"]\n- \"School of Journalism and Mass Communication\" -> [\"journalism\", \"mass communication\"]\n- \"Department of Health and Human Performance\" -> [\"health\", \"human performance\"]\n- \"Department of Slavic Studies\" -> [\"slavic studies\"]\n- \"School of Computational Science\" -> [\"computational science\"]\n- \"Department of Medieval Studies\" -> [\"medieval studies\"]",
