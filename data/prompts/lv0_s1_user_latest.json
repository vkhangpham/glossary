  "content": "You are an expert at extracting academic disciplines and fields of study from institutional unit names.\n\nGoal\nGiven a single input string in the field \"text\" that names a college/school-level unit, return the core academic discipline(s) it represents.\n\nInput format\n- A single string field named \"text\", e.g., \"School of Communications and Media\"\n\nOutput format\n- Produce two top-level fields:\n  - \"reasoning\": a brief explanation of your extraction choices (1–3 sentences)\n  - \"extraction\": a JSON array with one object of the form:\n    [{\"source\": \"<original input string>\", \"concepts\": [<list of extracted disciplines>]}]\n\nCore rules\n1) Extract only academic subjects, not institution types.\n   - Remove/ignore unit-type terms: college, school, faculty, division, department, center/centre, institute, program/programme, academy, office, unit.\n   - Remove prepositions/articles/connectors that are not part of a discipline: of, for, the, at, in, on.\n   - If nothing disciplinary remains (e.g., \"Graduate School\", \"School of Graduate Studies\", \"Graduate Division\", \"Honors College\", \"Institute for Advanced Study\"), return an empty list.\n\n2) Split conjunctions into separate disciplines.\n   - Split on: and, &, and/or, /, and commas (when separating distinct areas).\n   - Example: \"Arts and Sciences\" → [\"arts\", \"sciences\"].\n\n3) Keep multi-word disciplines intact.\n   - Examples: \"computer science\", \"political science\", \"public policy\", \"data science\", \"applied sciences\", \"health sciences\", \"liberal arts\", \"fine arts\", \"media studies\", \"social work\", \"human services\", \"information systems\".\n   - Do NOT split \"computer science\" into \"computer\" and \"science\".\n\n4) Handle shared head/tail constructions by reconstructing full fields.\n   - Shared suffix examples:\n     - \"Electrical and Computer Engineering\" → [\"electrical engineering\", \"computer engineering\"]\n     - \"Biological and Biomedical Sciences\" → [\"biological sciences\", \"biomedical sciences\"]\n   - Shared head examples:\n     - \"Information Science and Technology\" → [\"information science\", \"information technology\"]\n     - \"Materials Science and Engineering\" → [\"materials science\", \"materials engineering\"]\n   - Do not leave a generic residual term like \"technology\" or \"engineering\" when a modifier clearly applies to both sides; reconstruct both full disciplines.\n\n5) Remove person/donor names and other proper-name modifiers.\n   - Example: \"Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy\" → [\"public policy\"]\n   - Example: \"John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences\" → [\"engineering\", \"applied sciences\"]\n   - Heuristic: Drop leading sequences of capitalized words/initials before a unit-type term.\n\n6) Return an empty list for generic units without a specific academic field.\n   - Examples: \"Graduate School\", \"School of Graduate Studies\", \"Graduate Division\", \"Honors College\", \"Institute for Advanced Study\".\n   - Phrases like \"advanced study/studies\" without a subject are generic and should yield [].\n   - Treat \"professional studies\" as a generic unit label when it stands alone (e.g., \"School of Professional Studies\" → []). Only keep it if qualified by a specific disciplinary modifier that makes it a distinct field in context (otherwise exclude it).\n\n7) Normalize output.\n   - Always lowercase all concepts.\n   - Trim whitespace and deduplicate identical concepts.\n\nDomain-specific normalization and exclusions\n- Prefer canonical academic field names when the raw token is overly generic or non-disciplinary.\n  - Map \"media\" (when standing alone as a field) → \"media studies\".\n  - Avoid returning bare \"technology\" when a shared modifier is present; reconstruct it (e.g., \"Information Science and Technology\" → \"information technology\"). Return bare \"technology\" only if it is the sole explicit field with no available modifier AND the unit is not an institutional type (see below).\n- Important institutional-type exception for \"technology\":\n  - Treat \"Institute of Technology\" (and similar institutional constructions like \"Technology Institute\" or \"University of Technology\") as an institutional classification, not a discipline. For these, return [].\n  - Example: \"Institute of Technology\" → concepts: [].\n  - By contrast, if the unit explicitly names a disciplinary \"School/College/Department of Technology\" (and not an institutional \"Institute of Technology\"), you may return [\"technology\"] if no other modifiers are present.\n- Accept either singular or plural as they appear (e.g., \"communications\", \"humanities\", \"sciences\"). Do not force lemmatization unless required by the above mapping.\n- Exclude administrative or non-academic domains if they appear: admissions, advancement, development, operations, facilities, student life, finance, human resources, communications (as an administrative function under central administration). Note: When clearly an academic unit (e.g., \"School of Communications\"), \"communications\" is a valid discipline.\n\nAlgorithmic steps\n1) Read text; keep a copy as \"source\".\n2) Strip leading/trailing person/donor names that precede the unit type (look for sequences of capitalized words/initials before a unit-type term).\n3) Remove unit-type and connector words (see Rules 1 and 2).\n4) Identify conjunction-separated segments; split on \"and\", \"&\", \"and/or\", \"/\", and commas that separate distinct areas.\n5) Reconstruct shared head/tail phrases where applicable (Rule 4). If you see a pattern like \"[Modifier] X and Y\", and X/Y are discipline heads like \"science(s)\", \"engineering\", \"technology\", \"studies\", \"policy\", apply the modifier to both.\n6) Preserve known multi-word discipline compounds (Rule 3).\n7) Apply domain normalization (e.g., \"media\" → \"media studies\"); remove non-disciplinary/administrative terms. Treat standalone \"professional studies\" as generic and exclude it unless clearly specialized by a disciplinary modifier.\n8) Apply the institutional-type exception for \"technology\":\n   - If the remaining phrase is \"technology\" but the original unit is an \"Institute of Technology\" (or similar institutional construction), output [].\n9) Lowercase, trim, deduplicate.\n10) If nothing disciplinary remains or the unit is generic, return concepts: [].\n\nImportant constraints\n- Do not invent fields not implied by the text.\n- Keep multi-word disciplines intact.\n- Always lowercase the final concepts list.\n- Keep the \"reasoning\" brief (1–3 sentences).\n\nExamples\n- Input: \"School of Communications and Media\"\n  - Output concepts: [\"communications\", \"media studies\"]\n- Input: \"School of Art\"\n  - Output concepts: [\"art\"]\n- Input: \"College of Humanities\"\n  - Output concepts: [\"humanities\"]\n- Input: \"Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy\"\n  - Output concepts: [\"public policy\"]\n- Input: \"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering\"\n  - Output concepts: [\"electrical engineering\", \"computer engineering\"]\n- Input: \"Graduate School\"\n  - Output concepts: []\n- Input: \"Institute for Advanced Study\"\n  - Output concepts: []\n- Input: \"College of Information Science and Technology\"\n  - Output concepts: [\"information science\", \"information technology\"]\n- Input: \"Department of Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies\"\n  - Output concepts: [\"middle eastern studies\", \"islamic studies\"]\n- Input: \"School of Professional Studies\"\n  - Output concepts: []\n- Input: \"Institute of Technology\"\n  - Output concepts: []",
