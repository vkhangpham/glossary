Do not output institution types or unit labels (e.g., \"college\", \"school\", \"faculty\", \"division\", \"department\", \"institute\", \"center\", \"program\", \"academy\").\n2) Normalize all extracted concepts to lowercase.\n3) Keep multi-word disciplines together as single concepts (e.g., \"computer science\", \"information technology\", \"public policy\", \"veterinary medicine\").\n4) Split coordinated/conjoined phrases:\n   - Simple coordination with no shared head: split into separate concepts as written.\n     Example: \"Arts and Sciences\" → [\"arts\", \"sciences\"]; \"Physics and Astronomy\" → [\"physics\", \"astronomy\"].\n   - Shared head replication: if a head noun appears (explicitly or implicitly) for only one conjunct, apply that head to the other conjunct(s).\n     Examples:\n       - \"Electrical and Computer Engineering\" → [\"electrical engineering\", \"computer engineering\"].\n       - \"Library and Information Science\" → [\"library science\", \"information science\"].\n       - \"Biological and Biomedical Sciences\" → [\"biological sciences\", \"biomedical sciences\"].\n       - \"Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology\" → [\"molecular biology\", \"cellular biology\", \"developmental biology\"].\n     Heuristic: when a rightmost head like \"science/sciences\", \"engineering\", \"studies\", \"biology\" clearly governs multiple modifiers joined by \"and\", \"&\", commas, or slashes, replicate that head across all modifiers.\n5) Remove person/donor names and honorifics. If a person’s name appears attached to the unit (commonly before \"School/College of …\"), drop it and keep only the discipline(s).\n   Example: \"Gerald R.

Treat \"&\" and \"/\" the same as \"and\" for conjunction/replication purposes.\n7) Return an empty list [] only when the unit name is generic and does not denote any specific academic discipline.\n   - Return [] for administrative or level-only units: \"Graduate School\", \"School of Graduate Studies\", \"Honors College\", \"University College\".\n   - Do NOT treat broad fields as generic: extract disciplines like \"science\", \"arts\", \"engineering\", \"medicine\", \"law\", \"business\", \"humanities\", \"social sciences\", etc., when they appear as the post-\"of\" content.\n     Examples:\n       - \"College of Science\" → [\"science\"].\n       - \"Faculty of Arts\" → [\"arts\"].\n       - \"School of Engineering\" → [\"engineering\"].\n       - \"College of Arts & Sciences\" → [\"arts\", \"sciences\"].\n8) Preserve the original left-to-right order of concepts when multiple are extracted.\n9) Accept plural forms when they appear (e.g., \"sciences\" vs. \"science\"); do not singularize unless the phrase dictates it via head replication.\n10) If no valid discipline can be identified after applying the rules, return [].\n\nProcedure (recommended)\n- Identify and remove any leading donor/person names and unit labels (department/school/college/etc.), typically everything up to and including the first \"of\" if present, keeping the discipline phrase that follows.\n- If no \"of\" is present, treat the remaining phrase as the potential discipline phrase (e.g., \"Electrical and Computer Engineering\").\n- Normalize connectors (\"&\", \"/\", commas with conjunctions) and determine whether to split or replicate a shared head per Rule 4.\n- Remove function words and keep multi-word discipline terms intact.\n- Output concepts in lowercase, preserving plurality and original order.\n\nExamples\n- \"School of Information Technology\" → [\"information technology\"]\n- \"School of Veterinary Medicine\" → [\"veterinary medicine\"]\n- \"College of Arts & Sciences\" → [\"arts\", \"sciences\"]\n- \"Electrical and Computer Engineering\" → [\"electrical engineering\", \"computer engineering\"]\n- \"School of Library and Information Science\" → [\"library science\", \"information science\"]\n- \"Gerald R.
