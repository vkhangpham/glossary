Animal behavior consultants are usually employed to identify the cause of a behavior problem, to develop an intervention plan to change the problem behavior, and to help the owners learn how to execute that plan. Animal behavior consultants are distinct from animal trainers, in that their primary goal is not to train an animal to have basic manners or to perform a task, such as agility competition for dogs, but to mitigate behaviors that are problems for the animal's owner.\n",

The main position of cultural psychology is that mind and culture are inseparable, meaning that people are shaped by their culture and their culture is also shaped by them (Fiske, Kitayama, Markus, & Nisbett, 1998). Cultural psychology is the study of the way cultural traditions and social practices regulate, express, and transform the human psyche, resulting less in psychic unity for humankind than in ethnic divergences in mind, self, and emotion.\n",

      "processed_content": "**Balance**\nDesigns in balance (or equilibrium) have their parts arrangement planned, keeping a coherent visual pattern (color, shape, space). \"Balance\" is a concept based on human perception and the complex nature of the human senses of weight and proportion.\n\n**Contrast**\nDistinguishing by comparing/creating differences. Some ways of creating contrast among elements in the design include using contrasting colors, sizes, shapes, locations, or relationships.\n\n**Emphasis**\nMaking a specific element stand out or draw attention to the eye. Emphasis can be achieved in graphic design by placing elements on the page in positions where the eye is naturally drawn, by using other principles such as contrast, repetition, or movement.\n\n**Gestalt**\nSometimes considered a distinct principle of design, gestalt is the concept that \"the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.\" When viewing designs, humans apply this principle unconsciously by seeing connections and relationships among and between the elements in the design.\n\n**Proportion**\nProportion is the relationship of two or more elements in a design and how they compare with one another. Proportion is said to be harmonious when a correct relationship exists between the elements with respect to size or quantity.\n\n**Proximity**\nCloseness or distance of individual design elements. Close proximity indicates a connection. Proximity means grouping elements together so that you guide the viewer/reader to different parts of the message.\n\n**Repetition**\nRepeating a sequence; having it occur more than a few times. In design, repetition creates visual consistency in page designs, such as using the same style of headlines, the same style of initial capitals, or repeating the same basic layout from one page to another.\n\n**Rhythm**\nThe definition of rhythm is- the suggestion of motion through the use of various elements.\n\n**Unity**\nUnity is a feeling of wholeness, usually achieved when the parts complement each other in a way where they all have something in common.\n\n**White Space**\nAreas of a design void of text or graphics. In graphic design, the white space, or negative space, is considered an important element of the overall design.\n",

Clarke et al., 2002; Clements and Sarama, 2007, 2008; Thomson et al., 2005).\n\n**TEACHING SUBJECT-MATTER CONTENT THROUGH LEARNING TRAJECTORIES**\nLearning trajectories can help educators of young children understand and be responsive to children's developmental processes and constraints and their potential for thinking about and understanding content, and apply that understanding in creating more effective environments, instructional activities, and conversations.\nThe learning trajectories construct organizes, connects, and operationalizes the above three types of knowledge—especially content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge—for teaching specific subject-matter content.\nIt also adds an essential component of knowledge gained from psychological and educational research on how children think and learn about the content.\n\n**USING TIERED INTERVENTION APPROACHES**\nTiered intervention approaches, in which educators identify which children have learned particular content or skills and which children might benefit from additional instruction and support, are important for early prevention and intervention.\nEducators need to be able to implement these approaches so that they are continuous, flexible, dynamic, and focused on the range of critical skills and proficiencies children need to develop.\n\n**USING A MIX OF INSTRUCTIONAL METHODS**\nThus, effective approaches combine multiple complementary instructional strategies, ranging from initial children-centered exploration and invention, to guided lessons on optimal strategies and generalization, to practice for fluency (Clements and Sarama, 2009; Murata and Fuson, 2006; NCTM, 2006; NMP, 2008).\nIn summary, concepts and skills develop together and support each other (Carpenter et al., 1998; Fuson and Briars, 1990; Fuson et al., 1997b; Resnick, 1992; Verschaffel et al., 2007).\nIndeed, instruction and curricula that emphasize conceptual understanding simultaneously with procedural skills and flexible application of multiple strategies lead not only to equivalent skills but also to more fluent, flexible use of those skills, as well as to superior conceptual understanding, compared with approaches that initially emphasize mastery of procedures (Fuson and Kwon, 1992; NMP, 2008).\n\n**USING INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACHES TO INSTRUCTION**\nTeaching and learning need to be connected across developmental domains and subject areas.\nSuch connections across standards, curricula, and teaching are best made through approaches that are not just “integrated” (which often means making connections that are superficial and do not serve learning goals) but “interdisciplinary”—making rich connections among domains and subject areas, but allowing each to retain its core conceptual, procedural, and epistemological structures.\n\n**ENSURING FOLLOW-THROUGH AND CONTINUITY**\nGiven how young children develop, it is unrealistic to expect the effects of early interventions to last indefinitely, without continual, progressive support in later schooling of children's nascent learning trajectories (Brooks-Gunn, 2003; O'Connor et al., 2013, 2014).\nEarly positive effects may be weakened by, for example, later settings that assume low levels of knowledge, focus on lower-level skills, and have low expectations for certain groups (Carpenter and Moser, 1984; Engel et al., 2013; van den Heuvel-Panhuizen, 1996).\n\n**GENERAL EDUCATIONAL PRACTICES FOR WORKING WITH INFANTS AND TODDLERS**\nThe central feature of these shared activities is that, rather than being entirely directed by the educator, instruction emerges from the interaction of the educator with the young child and their context.\nThis interaction builds on the child's interests and understanding and the educator's efforts to stimulate early learning by responding to those interests and stimulating them through the learning opportunities afforded by the classroom or other learning context.\nThis approach to early education has been described in what is known as emergent curriculum (Jones and Nimmo, 1994; Stacey, 2009), and other curricular approaches follow similar principles.\n\n**LANGUAGE AND LITERACY**\nThe active ingredient of supporting language development in care and education settings relates to educators' use of high-quality language interactions (such as extending what a child says and using varied and complex language) and social scaffolding of language and literacy skills, a form of instructional guidance by which educators progressively provide less ongoing support as development proceeds to enable students to exercise independent skill (Duke and Block, 2012; Turnbull et al., 2009).\nAs discussed in detail in Chapter 4, there is a reciprocal relationship between vocabulary development (a complex and integrative feature of language that grows continuously) and reading words (a skill that most children master by third or fourth grade), and together these skills support reading comprehension (Ehri, 2005; Gough et al., 1996).\nIn developing language and literacy skills, children benefit from extensive opportunities to listen to and use complex spoken language (National Early Literacy Panel, 2008).\n\n**MATHEMATICS**\nChildren generally follow certain developmental paths in learning mathematics, as described in Chapter 4.\nAs they learn about a mathematical topic, they progress through increasingly sophisticated levels of thinking.\nThese form the core of a learning trajectory: to develop a certain mathematical competence (the goal), children construct each level of thinking in turn (the developmental progression), aided by tasks and teaching that are designed to enable thinking at each higher level (instructional activities) (Clements and Sarama, 2014; Sarama and Clements, 2009).\n\n**SCIENCE**\nYoung children are fascinated with and construct many ideas about how the world works.\nThey investigate and refine these ideas by exploring and questioning the world around them.\nResearch shows that preschool children know a great deal about the natural world, including concepts related to physics, biology, psychology, and chemistry (NRC, 2007).\nAs with language and literacy and mathematics, they also possess thinking skills and habits of mind that support later, more sophisticated, scientific reasoning.\n\n**FOSTERING SOCIOEMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT**\nGenerally speaking, learning environments that are well structured and predictable, that provide support for children's self-regulatory capacities, and that offer secure and warm relationships with educators will provide the greatest benefits to all children.\nChildren experiencing chronic stress and adversity may have other specific needs for support as well, but such a learning environment can help buffer stress for these children.\nProviding such an environment not only helps these children, but also helps educators maintain a constructive classroom environment that is not regularly subject to behavioral disruptions.\n\n**USING TECHNOLOGY EFFECTIVELY**\nThe first is use of technology as a tool for directly facilitating children's learning.\nThe second entails the use of technology to facilitate other aspects of professional practice, such as assessment of children, creation and management of the learning environment, documentation, information sharing, and communication with families and with other practitioners.\nThis section focuses primarily on the first form of technology use: what knowledge teachers need to have about how children interact with and learn through technology and what skills they need to put that knowledge into practice in the classroom.\n\n**SUPPORTING THE EARLY LEARNING OF DUAL LANGUAGE LEARNERS**\nComprehensive early screening of the key skills and competencies related to literacy development is essential to prevent risk and vulnerabilities from becoming difficulties, given what is known about the relationships between early language and literacy skills and later academic achievement.\nSupporting the development and learning of multilingual children in early care and education settings and schools requires an instructional approach that is organized around language and knowledge building while simultaneously addressing the children's need to acquire early reading skills (e.g., letter knowledge, word reading).\nResearch on effective instructional practices with young multilingual learners highlights the promise and importance of several strategies and approaches that, together, prepare multilingual learners for the oral and written language they will encounter in the later grades:\n\n**SUPPORTING THE EARLY LEARNING OF CHILDREN WITH AND AT RISK FOR DISABILITIES**\nResearchers have developed specific instructional strategies or components of instructional strategies for the acquisition and generalization of key skills by young children with or at risk for disabilities (Godfrey et al., 2003; Roark et al., 2002; Sewell et al., 1998; Whalen et al., 1996).\nThese approaches vary along several dimensions, including what is taught, when teaching occurs, the spacing of teaching trials, and the type of instructional procedure that is used.\nAn issue with these strategies is how they can be implemented during naturally occurring activities and routines so that the instruction leads not only to the acquisition of new skills but also to higher levels of engagement in ongoing activities and routines for children with disabilities.\n\n**WORKING WITH FAMILIES**\nCare and education professionals need skills in communicating, working collaboratively, and developing partnerships with families.\nThey have an important role in preparing families to engage in behaviors and activities that enhance development and early learning, and to maintain continuity and consistency across home and out-of-home settings and learning environments for young children.\nFamilies are the people most invested in their children's growth and development, they can be the most valuable support they have in their school career—and they are experts on their children.\n\n**CONDUCTING CHILD ASSESSMENTS**\nWhile early learning standards provide a roadmap for what young children should know and be able to do, early care and education professionals, including practitioners and leaders, also need the competencies to understand how individual and groups of children are learning and developing across the birth through age 8 continuum.\nFor educators, assessment should enhance their powers of observation and their understanding of children's overall thinking and learning.\nAcross all levels of education systems, assessments can be used to inform continuous quality improvement (Chittenden, 1991; Chittenden and Jones, 1999).\n",

      "processed_content": "*   The Italians never had much love for theological studies, and those who were addicted to them preferred Paris to Italy.\n*   It was something more practical, more positive, that had attraction for the Italians, and especially the study of Roman law.\n*   The intellectual life of Italy showed itself in an altogether special, positive, almost scientific, form, in the study of Roman law, in the chronicles of Farfa, of Marsicano and of many others, in translations from Aristotle, in the precepts of the school of Salerno, in the travels of Marco Polo—in short, in a long series of facts which seem to detach themselves from the surroundings of the middle age, and to be united on the one side with classical Rome and on the other with the Renaissance.\n*   The necessary consequence of all this was that the Latin language was most tenacious in Italy, and that the elaboration of the new vulgar tongue was very slow,—being in fact preceded by two periods of Italian literature in foreign languages.\n*   It is now an established historical fact that there existed no writing in Italian before the 13th century.\n*   In the south of Italy, on the other hand, the love-song prevailed.\n*   Imitation was the fundamental characteristic of this school, to which belonged Enzio, king of Sardinia, Pier delle Vigne, Inghilfredi, Guido and Odo delle Colonne, Jacopo d’ Aquino, Rugieri Pugliese, Giacomo da Lentino, Arrigo Testa and others.\n*   The intellectual movement which had been gathering for a long time, made itself felt in Italy in the 15th century.\n*   The fundamental characteristic of the literary epoch following that of the Renaissance is that it perfected itself in every kind of art, in particular uniting the essentially Italian character of its language with classicism of style.\n*   His characteristic is that he assimilated the romance of chivalry to the style and models of classicism.\n*   This period is known in the history of Italian literature as the Secentismo.\n*   Its writers, devoid of sentiment, of passion, of thoughts, resorted to exaggeration; they tried to produce effect with every kind of affectation, with bombast, with the strangest metaphors, in fact, with what in art is called mannerism, “barocchism.”\n*   The Arcadia was so called because its chief aim and intention were to imitate in literature the simplicity of the ancient shepherds, who were fabulously supposed to have lived in Arcadia in the golden age.\n*   And it is precisely realism in art that characterizes Italian literature from Manzoni onwards.\n",

      "processed_content": "*   United States labor law sets the rights and duties for employees, labor unions, and employers in the US.\n*   Labor law's basic aim is to remedy the \"inequality of bargaining power\" between employees and employers, especially employers \"organized in the corporate or other forms of ownership association\".\n*   A contract of employment can always create better terms than statutory minimum rights.\n*   Since the Civil Rights Act of 1964, all employing entities and labor unions have a duty to treat employees equally, without discrimination based on \"race, color, religion, sex, or national origin\".\n*   The Occupational Safety and Health Act,[215] signed into law in 1970 by President Richard Nixon, creates specific standards for workplace safety.\n*   Because individuals lack bargaining power, especially against wealthy corporations, labor law creates legal rights that override arbitrary market outcomes.\n*   Historically, the law faithfully enforced property rights and freedom of contract on any terms,[61] whether or not this was inefficient, exploitative and unjust.\n*   The federal right to collective bargaining, by a labor union elected by its employees, is meant to reduce the inherently unequal bargaining power of individuals against organizations to make collective agreements.\n*   The federal right to a minimum wage, and increased overtime pay for working over 40 hours a week, was designed to ensure a \"minimum standard of living necessary for health, efficiency, and general well-being of workers\", even when a person could not get a high enough wage by individual bargaining.\n*   The central right in labor law, beyond minimum standards for pay, hours, pensions, safety or privacy, is to participate and vote in workplace governance.\n*   While union governance is founded upon freedom of association, the law requires basic standards of democracy and accountability to ensure members are truly free in shaping their associations.\n*   At any point employers can freely bargain with union representatives and make a collective agreement.\n*   Under NLRA 1935 §158(d) the mandatory subjects of collective bargaining include \"wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment\".\n*   To ensure that employees are effectively able to bargain for a collective agreement, the NLRA 1935 created a group of rights in §158 to stall \"unfair labor practices\" by employers.\n*   The right of labor to take collective action, including the right to strike, has been fundamental to common law,[313] federal law,[314] and international law for over a century.\n*   The reasons or \"causes\" that an employer can give to terminate employment affect everything from people's income, to the ability to pay the rent, to getting health insurance.\n*   Today legislation bans discrimination, that is unrelated to an employee's ability to do a job, based on sex, race,[397] ethnicity, national origin, age and disability.\n*   In addition to prohibitions on discriminatory treatment, harassment, and detriment in retaliation for asserting rights, is prohibited.\n*   In addition to disparate treatment, employing entities may not use practices having an unjustified disparate impact on protected groups.\n*   Job security laws in the United States are the weakest in the developed world, as there are no federal statutory rights yet.\n*   The only statutory right for employees is for extreme cases of mass layoffs under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988.\n*   The right to full employment or the \"right to work\" in a fair paying job is a universal human right in international law,[501] partly inspired by the experience of the New Deal in the 1930s.\n*   While the laws for a federal or state job guarantee have not yet been used, the Federal Reserve Act 1913 does require that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System should use its powers \"to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.\"\n*   In 1945, New Jersey enacted the first statewide civil rights act in the entire nation. with the purpose of protecting citizens against harassment and employment discrimination on the basis of: race, creed, color, national origin, nationality, or ancestry.\n",

The CLIL approach principally involves studying one subject (for example, biology, science or history) and learning a language, such as English, at the same time — effectively integrating the two subjects.\n2. Cooperative Language Learning or CLL forms part of a wider teaching approach known as Collaborative or Community Language Learning (CLL).\n3. When using the Direct Method of language teaching, all teaching happens in the target language, forcing the learner to think and speak in that language.\n4. The Grammar-Translation Method (GTM) is a very traditional teaching approach which prioritises translation from the students’ mother tongue into the target language and vice versa.\n5. Total Physical Response or TPR is a way of language teaching in which the teacher presents language objects as instructions and the students have to do exactly what the teacher tells them.\n6. It’s perhaps hard to imagine a language classroom where the teacher doesn’t actually say much, but that’s the principle at the heart of this approach.\n7. For them, learning a language requires structure, textbooks, resources and memorising grammar rules or vocabulary lists.\n",

      "processed_content": "*   Network approaches involve the identification of system components (network nodes) and the relations among them (links between nodes).\n*   In this Primer, we present network analysis of multivariate data as a method that combines both multivariate statistics and network science to investigate the structure of relationships in multivariate data.\n*   This approach identifies network nodes with variables and links between nodes and describes them with statistical parameters that connect these variables (for example, partial correlations).\n*   Statistical models are used to assess the parameters that define the links in the network, in a process known as network structure estimation.\n*   Then, using a process of network description, the resulting network is characterized using the tools of network science15,16,17.\n*   Here, we refer to this combined procedure of network structure estimation and network description as psychometric network analysis (Fig. 1).\n*   The core of the psychometric network analysis methodology then lies in the steps of network structure estimation, network description and network stability analysis.\n*   A conditional association between two variables holds when these variables are probabilistically dependent, conditional on all other variables in the data.\n*   The strength of this conditional association is typically represented in the network as an edge weight that describes the connection between two nodes.\n*   The description of the joint probability distribution of a set of variables in terms of pairwise statistical interactions is a graphical model12 known as the pairwise Markov random field (PMRF)27.\n*   In a PMRF, the joint likelihood of multivariate data is modelled through the use of pairwise conditional associations, leading to a network representation that is undirected.\n*   In this case, the associations between variables are driven by individual differences, which renders such networks useful for studying the psychometric structure of psychological tests29.\n*   In network applications to longitudinal data (also referred to as panel data), a limited set of repeated measurements characterize both the association structure of variables at a given time point and the way these conditional dependencies’ change over time (N > T).\n*   Networks as applied to time-series data of one or multiple persons characterize multivariate dependencies between time series of variables that are assessed intra-individually (T = large, N ≥ 1).\n*   In this case, violations of independence occur in two ways: temporal dependencies are introduced owing to the temporal aspect of data gathering (for example, a person who feels sad at 12:00 might still feel sad at 15:00), and responses from the same person may correlate more strongly with one another than responses between different persons (for example, a person might feel, on average, very sad in all responses).\n*   In addition, estimated PMRFs often describe the data successfully with only a subset of the possible parameters (for example, using sparse network structures), which leads to more insightful network visualizations.\n*   Once a network structure is estimated, network description tools from network science can be applied to investigate the topology of PMRF networks3,60.\n*   In sparse networks, few (if any) edges are present relative to the total number of possible edges.\n*   In dense networks, the converse holds, and relatively many edges are present.\n*   The most commonly used centrality metrics are node strength, which sums the absolute edge weights of edges per node; closeness, which quantifies the distance between the node and all other nodes by averaging the shortest path lengths to all other nodes; and betweenness, which quantifies how often a node lies on the shortest path connecting any two other nodes65.\n*   In this section discusses three areas in which this approach has been particularly successful.\n*   Psychometric network analysis of personality traits and motivational goals combined offers a novel way to explore relations among relatively stable dispositions.\n*   Based on the network theory of attitudes (Box 2) one expects that temperature should decrease throughout the years, because Bill Clinton was probably more on individuals’ minds when he was president than before he was president.\n*   The network theory of psychopathology80,81 suggests that mental disorders are best understood as clusters of symptoms sufficiently unified by causal relations among those symptoms that support induction, explanation, prediction and control82,83 (Box 3).\n*   The resulting networks can be used to inform our understanding of how the modelled variables evolve over time (Fig. 6).\n*   Network models are suited to estimate and represent patterns of conditional associations without requiring strong a priori assumptions on the generating model, which renders them well suited to exploratory data analysis and visualization of dependency patterns in multivariate data.\n*   As statistical analysis methods, the software routines for estimating, visualizing and analysing networks enhance existing exploratory data analysis methods, as they focus specifically on the patterns of pairwise conditional associations between variables.\n*   The resulting network representation of conditional associations between variables, as encoded in the PMRF, may be of interest in its own right, but can also function as a gateway that allows the researcher to assess the plausibility of different generating models that may produce the relevant conditional associations.\n*   Because network models for multivariate data explicitly represent pairwise interactions between components in a system, they form a natural bridge from data analysis to theory formation based on network science principles3.\n*   In this manner, models of intra-individual dynamics can serve as explanations of systems of inter-individual differences, bridging the gap between intra-individual and inter-individual modelling129.\n",

The lithosphere is broken up into seven very large continental- and ocean-sized plates, six or seven medium-sized regional plates, and several small ones. These plates move relative to each other, typically at rates of 5 to 10 cm (2 to 4 inches) per year, and interact along their boundaries, where they converge, diverge, or slip past one another.\nIn essence, plate-tectonic theory is elegantly simple. Earth’s surface layer, 50 to 100 km (30 to 60 miles) thick, is rigid and is composed of a set of large and small plates. Together, these plates constitute the lithosphere, from the Greek lithos, meaning “rock.”\n",

It deals primarily with the consideration and minimization of the effects of random variability upon the performance of an engineering system during the design phase. It differs from the classical approach to design by assuming a small probability of failure instead of using the safety factor.\nWhen using a probabilistic approach to design, the designer no longer thinks of each variable as a single value or number. Instead, each variable is viewed as a continuous random variable with a probability distribution. From this perspective, probabilistic design predicts the flow of variability (or distributions) through a system.\nTypically, the goal of probabilistic design is to identify the design that will exhibit the smallest effects of random variability.\n",

In structural typing, an element is considered to be compatible with another if, for each feature within the second element's type, a corresponding and identical feature exists in the first element's type. Two types are considered to be identical if each is compatible with the other.\n",
