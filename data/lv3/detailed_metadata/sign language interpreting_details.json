        "pattern. Whenever they are signing, these interpreters must be seen in order to fulfil their",

        "particularly occupying a corner of a television screen, but also in settings such as theatres,",
        "political conventions and other civic events. It is ironic, but true, that the most prominent SLI",
        "on Earth \u2013 at the globally-televised memorial ceremony for Nelson Mandela in South Africa \u2013",
        "turned out to be an incompetent \u2018fake\u2019 interpreter (Turner 2013) whose disreputable actions",
