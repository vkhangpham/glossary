            "processed_content": "**Brazil**\nThe constitution of Brazil defines health as a universal right and a state responsibility.\nThe Brazilian health system, known as SUS (Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade), was conceived during the 1980s as part of the social movement aimed at Brazil\u2019s re-democratization.\nSUS was officially created in 1988 by the new Brazilian constitution.\n\n**Canada**\nCanadian Medicare \u2014 Canada\u2019s universal, publicly funded health care system \u2014 was established through federal legislation originally passed in 1957 and in 1966.\nThe Canada Health Act of 1984 replaces and consolidates the two previous acts and sets national standards for medically necessary hospital, diagnostic, and physician services.\n\n**China**\nChina largely achieved universal insurance coverage in 2011 through three public insurance programs:\n\n**Denmark**\nAll registered Danish residents are automatically enrolled in publicly financed health care, which is largely free at the point of use.\nUniversal access to health care underlies Denmark\u2019s Health Law, which sets out the government\u2019s obligation to promote population health and prevent and treat illness, suffering, and functional limitations; to ensure high-quality care and easy and equal access; and to promote service integration, choice, transparency, access to information, and short waiting times.\n\n**England**\nHealth coverage in England has been universal since the creation of the National Health Service (NHS) in 1948.\nUnder the 1946 Act, the Minister of Health had a duty to provide a comprehensive, free health service, replacing voluntary insurance and out-of-pocket payments.\n\n**France**\nUniversal coverage was achieved over seven decades by extending statutory health insurance (SHI) to all employees (in 1945), retirees (in 1945), the self-employed (in 1966), and the unemployed (in 2000).\nIn January 2016, SHI eligibility was universally granted under the Protection universelle maladie (Universal Health Protection law), or PUMa, to fill in the few remaining coverage gaps.\n\n**Germany**\nChancellor Otto von Bismarck's Health Insurance Act of 1883 established the first social health insurance system in the world.\nThe final step toward universal health coverage occurred in 2007, when health insurance, either statutory or private, was mandated for all citizens and permanent residents.\n\n**India**\nThe constitution of India obliges the government to ensure the \u201cright to health\u201d for all.\nEach state is required to provide free universal access to health care services.\n\n**Israel**\nSince 1995, Israel\u2019s National Health Insurance (NHI) law has ensured universal coverage for citizens and permanent residents.\nAs the law states, \"Health insurance\u2026shall be based on principles of justice, equality and mutual assistance.\"\nUnder this commitment, every resident is entitled to health care services.\n\n**Italy**\nUniversal coverage is provided through Italy\u2019s National Health Service (Servizio sanitario nazionale, or SSN), established through legislation in 1978.\nThe SSN automatically covers all citizens and legal foreign residents.\n\n**Japan**\nJapan\u2019s statutory health insurance system (SHIS) covers 98.3 percent of the population, while the separate Public Social Assistance Program, for impoverished people, covers the remaining 1.7 percent.\nCitizens and resident noncitizens are required to enroll in an SHIS plan; undocumented immigrants and visitors are not covered.\n\n**Netherlands**\nIn the Netherlands, a national health insurance program was first rolled out in 1941, reflecting the German Bismarck model of public and private health insurers.\nThe 2006 Health Insurance Act merged the traditional public and private insurance markets into one universal social health insurance program underpinned by private insurance and mandatory coverage.\nAll residents (and nonresidents who pay Dutch income tax) must purchase statutory health insurance from private insurers.\n\n**New Zealand**\nBeginning with the 1938 Social Security Act, a consensus developed in New Zealand that government has a fundamental role in providing for the population\u2019s health care needs.\nNot long after that law\u2019s passage, the government achieved its goal of universal health coverage.\n\n**Norway**\nNorway has universal health and social insurance coverage, known as the National Insurance Scheme (NIS), or Folketrygd.\nIt is currently regulated by the 1997 National Insurance Act and the 1999 Patient Rights Act.\n\n**Singapore**\nSingapore\u2019s health care financing system is underpinned by the belief that all stakeholders share responsibility for attaining sustainable universal health coverage.\nSingapore has a multipayer health care financing framework, where a single treatment episode might be covered by multiple schemes and payers, often overlapping.\n\n**Sweden**\nThe Health and Medical Services Act states that Sweden\u2019s health system must cover all legal residents.\nCoverage is universal and automatic.\n\n**Switzerland**\nHistorically, health insurance in Switzerland had been provided by many small private insurers.\nAfter several attempts to introduce a system of universal coverage, the federal government adopted the Health Insurance Law in 1994, based on a private insurance model.\nSince going into effect in 1996, health insurance coverage is close to 100 percent.\n\n**Taiwan**\nTaiwan's NHI system was implemented in 1995.\nNHI is a government-run social health insurance program that provides equitable medical and health care services to all in case of illness, injury, and childbirth.\nEnrollment in NHI is mandatory for all citizens and for foreigners legally residing in Taiwan for longer than six months.\n\n**United States**\nThe United States does not have universal health insurance coverage.\nIn 1965, the first public insurance programs, Medicare and Medicaid, were enacted through the Social Security Act, and others followed.\n",
