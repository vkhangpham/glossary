This popular approach is used in many classrooms because of its ability to combine in-person learning with online resources.\n\n**Inquiry-Based Learning:**\nThe inquiry-based learning model takes the traditional learning model where the teachers lecture and the students listen and flip it around, so the students are the ones doing the asking and the teacher guides them to find the answers they are looking for.\n\n**Cooperative Learning:**\nCooperative learning is another popular teaching method many educators use that force students to interact and work with one another much more than other teaching methods.\n\n**Differentiated Instruction:**\nDifferentiated instruction tailors\u2019 instruction to cater to the unique learning style, readiness, and interests of each student.\n\n**Culturally Responsive Teaching:**\nCulturally responsive teaching (CRT) is the ability to relate to people not only from your own culture but to that of others as well.\n\n**Trauma-Informed Teaching:**\nTrauma-informed teaching is an approach that recognizes and understands the effects that trauma has on student\u2019s learning and behavior.\n\n**Social-Emotional Learning:**\nSocial-emotional learning (SEL) involves teaching and developing students\u2019 self-awareness, social awareness, self-management, relationship skills, and responsible decision-making skills.\n\n**Gamification:**\nGamification in education uses game-like features in lessons to help engage students in what they are learning.\n\n**Flipped Learning:**\nA flipped classroom essentially reverses the traditional learning model where students acquire knowledge at home and then apply that understanding in the classroom with their peers.\n\n**Project-Based Learning:**\nProject-based learning (PBL) emphasizes using real-world, hands-on learning experiences that require students to think critically, problem-solve, and collaborate and communicate with others.\n",
