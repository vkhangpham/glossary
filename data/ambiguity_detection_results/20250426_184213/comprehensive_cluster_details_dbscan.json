The program focuses on task activities and prepares the nurse for the National Council Licensure Examination for Licensed Practical Nurses (NCLEX). LPN/LVNs work in a variety of settings including hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, rehabilitation centers, schools, and individual or group homes.\n\n**Hospital-Based Diploma Nurse**\nHospital-based Diplomas in Nursing were historically the primary form of nursing education, first appearing in the early 20th century. Diploma programs typically have a strong focus on practical application of skills, with a larger percentage of time spent on the \u201chands-on\u201d component of learning. Students attend classes for two to three years, at the completion of which they take the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN) certifying exam, a standard exam for all practicing registered nurses.\n\n**Associate Degree in Nursing**\nAn Associate Degree in Nursing (ADN) is the minimum educational requirement to become a registered nurse in the United States. ADN nursing programs typically take two years to complete but courses required differ by state. Associate degree nurses are able to work in both outpatient and inpatient settings.\n\n**Bachelor of Science Degree in Nursing**\nBachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degrees prepare nurses for a wide variety of professional roles and graduate study within nursing. It is typically acquired through a four-year program at a college or university. Baccalaureate programs include a variety of liberal arts courses and professional education and training in the nursing field.\n\n**Master of Science Degree in Nursing**\nThe Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) is an advanced degree that allows for a more specialized role in nursing. Career paths include certified nurse practitioner (CNP), certified nurse anesthetist (CRNA), clinical nurse specialist (CNS), or Certified Nurse\u2010Midwife (CNM). Master's prepared nurses are trained in advanced assessment, counseling of patients, management, leadership, research and education.\n\n**Doctor of Nursing Practice Degree**\nThe scope of practice for a Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) includes assessing, diagnosing, prescribing, consulting, screening, educating, initiating referrals, and the coordination of patient care. Specific practice guidelines can vary by state and area of practice. In order to become a DNP, one would need to obtain his or her doctorate in nursing practice.\n\n**Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing**\nNurses who hold a Doctor of Philosophy Degree in Nursing (PhD), are less about hands-on patient care and more about the abstract thinking that helps move the profession forward. A nurse with a PhD has the training needed to conduct research aimed at changing nursing science or practice. PhD prepared nurses teach as academic faculty, conduct research, evaluate programs, hold academic and leadership positions, write books, and lead health care organizations.\n",

Cardozo's answer is that judges should do what they have always done in the Anglo-American legal tradition, namely, follow and apply the law in easy cases, and make new law in hard cases by balancing competing considerations, including the paramount value of social welfare. Cardozo identifies four leading methods of legal analysis: (1) the method of logic (or \"analogy,\" or \"philosophy\"), which seeks to extend legal principles in ways that preserve logical consistency; (2) the method of history (or \"evolution\"), which adverts to the historical origins of the legal rule or concept; (3) the method of custom (or \"tradition\"), which views social customs as helpful guides to community values and settled expectations; and (4) the method of sociology, which looks to considerations of reason, justice, utility, and social welfare.\n",

The principle of institutional settlement looks at how society decided: \"that law should allocate decisionmaking to the institutions best suited to decide particular questions, and that the decisions arrived at by those institutions must then be respected by other actors in the system, even if those actors would have reached a different conclusion\"\nThe legal process school recognized the claims of legal realists that judges do, in fact, make law, and that adjudication is not merely the mechanical deduction from precedent and statutory texts claimed by formalists. Unlike the realists, however, legal process claims that, as Fallon puts it, \"while the judicial role is irreducibly creative in some respects, it is limited to the reasoned elaboration of principles and policies that are ultimately traceable to more democratically legitimate decisionmakers.\"\nCourts must reason from legal materials using principles that \"in their generality and their neutrality transcend any immediate result that is involved.\"\n",

            "processed_content": "*   Network approaches involve the identification of system components (network nodes) and the relations among them (links between nodes).\n*   In this Primer, we present network analysis of multivariate data as a method that combines both multivariate statistics and network science to investigate the structure of relationships in multivariate data.\n*   This approach identifies network nodes with variables and links between nodes and describes them with statistical parameters that connect these variables (for example, partial correlations).\n*   Statistical models are used to assess the parameters that define the links in the network, in a process known as network structure estimation.\n*   Then, using a process of network description, the resulting network is characterized using the tools of network science15,16,17.\n*   Here, we refer to this combined procedure of network structure estimation and network description as psychometric network analysis (Fig. 1).\n*   The core of the psychometric network analysis methodology then lies in the steps of network structure estimation, network description and network stability analysis.\n*   A conditional association between two variables holds when these variables are probabilistically dependent, conditional on all other variables in the data.\n*   The strength of this conditional association is typically represented in the network as an edge weight that describes the connection between two nodes.\n*   The description of the joint probability distribution of a set of variables in terms of pairwise statistical interactions is a graphical model12 known as the pairwise Markov random field (PMRF)27.\n*   In a PMRF, the joint likelihood of multivariate data is modelled through the use of pairwise conditional associations, leading to a network representation that is undirected.\n*   In this case, the associations between variables are driven by individual differences, which renders such networks useful for studying the psychometric structure of psychological tests29.\n*   In network applications to longitudinal data (also referred to as panel data), a limited set of repeated measurements characterize both the association structure of variables at a given time point and the way these conditional dependencies\u2019 change over time (N > T).\n*   Networks as applied to time-series data of one or multiple persons characterize multivariate dependencies between time series of variables that are assessed intra-individually (T = large, N \u2265 1).\n*   In this case, violations of independence occur in two ways: temporal dependencies are introduced owing to the temporal aspect of data gathering (for example, a person who feels sad at 12:00 might still feel sad at 15:00), and responses from the same person may correlate more strongly with one another than responses between different persons (for example, a person might feel, on average, very sad in all responses).\n*   In addition, estimated PMRFs often describe the data successfully with only a subset of the possible parameters (for example, using sparse network structures), which leads to more insightful network visualizations.\n*   Once a network structure is estimated, network description tools from network science can be applied to investigate the topology of PMRF networks3,60.\n*   In sparse networks, few (if any) edges are present relative to the total number of possible edges.\n*   In dense networks, the converse holds, and relatively many edges are present.\n*   The most commonly used centrality metrics are node strength, which sums the absolute edge weights of edges per node; closeness, which quantifies the distance between the node and all other nodes by averaging the shortest path lengths to all other nodes; and betweenness, which quantifies how often a node lies on the shortest path connecting any two other nodes65.\n*   In this section discusses three areas in which this approach has been particularly successful.\n*   Psychometric network analysis of personality traits and motivational goals combined offers a novel way to explore relations among relatively stable dispositions.\n*   Based on the network theory of attitudes (Box 2) one expects that temperature should decrease throughout the years, because Bill Clinton was probably more on individuals\u2019 minds when he was president than before he was president.\n*   The network theory of psychopathology80,81 suggests that mental disorders are best understood as clusters of symptoms sufficiently unified by causal relations among those symptoms that support induction, explanation, prediction and control82,83 (Box 3).\n*   The resulting networks can be used to inform our understanding of how the modelled variables evolve over time (Fig. 6).\n*   Network models are suited to estimate and represent patterns of conditional associations without requiring strong a priori assumptions on the generating model, which renders them well suited to exploratory data analysis and visualization of dependency patterns in multivariate data.\n*   As statistical analysis methods, the software routines for estimating, visualizing and analysing networks enhance existing exploratory data analysis methods, as they focus specifically on the patterns of pairwise conditional associations between variables.\n*   The resulting network representation of conditional associations between variables, as encoded in the PMRF, may be of interest in its own right, but can also function as a gateway that allows the researcher to assess the plausibility of different generating models that may produce the relevant conditional associations.\n*   Because network models for multivariate data explicitly represent pairwise interactions between components in a system, they form a natural bridge from data analysis to theory formation based on network science principles3.\n*   In this manner, models of intra-individual dynamics can serve as explanations of systems of inter-individual differences, bridging the gap between intra-individual and inter-individual modelling129.\n",

            "processed_content": "**Brazil**\nThe constitution of Brazil defines health as a universal right and a state responsibility.\nThe Brazilian health system, known as SUS (Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade), was conceived during the 1980s as part of the social movement aimed at Brazil\u2019s re-democratization.\nSUS was officially created in 1988 by the new Brazilian constitution.\n\n**Canada**\nCanadian Medicare \u2014 Canada\u2019s universal, publicly funded health care system \u2014 was established through federal legislation originally passed in 1957 and in 1966.\nThe Canada Health Act of 1984 replaces and consolidates the two previous acts and sets national standards for medically necessary hospital, diagnostic, and physician services.\n\n**China**\nChina largely achieved universal insurance coverage in 2011 through three public insurance programs:\n\n**Denmark**\nAll registered Danish residents are automatically enrolled in publicly financed health care, which is largely free at the point of use.\nUniversal access to health care underlies Denmark\u2019s Health Law, which sets out the government\u2019s obligation to promote population health and prevent and treat illness, suffering, and functional limitations; to ensure high-quality care and easy and equal access; and to promote service integration, choice, transparency, access to information, and short waiting times.\n\n**England**\nHealth coverage in England has been universal since the creation of the National Health Service (NHS) in 1948.\nUnder the 1946 Act, the Minister of Health had a duty to provide a comprehensive, free health service, replacing voluntary insurance and out-of-pocket payments.\n\n**France**\nUniversal coverage was achieved over seven decades by extending statutory health insurance (SHI) to all employees (in 1945), retirees (in 1945), the self-employed (in 1966), and the unemployed (in 2000).\nIn January 2016, SHI eligibility was universally granted under the Protection universelle maladie (Universal Health Protection law), or PUMa, to fill in the few remaining coverage gaps.\n\n**Germany**\nChancellor Otto von Bismarck's Health Insurance Act of 1883 established the first social health insurance system in the world.\nThe final step toward universal health coverage occurred in 2007, when health insurance, either statutory or private, was mandated for all citizens and permanent residents.\n\n**India**\nThe constitution of India obliges the government to ensure the \u201cright to health\u201d for all.\nEach state is required to provide free universal access to health care services.\n\n**Israel**\nSince 1995, Israel\u2019s National Health Insurance (NHI) law has ensured universal coverage for citizens and permanent residents.\nAs the law states, \"Health insurance\u2026shall be based on principles of justice, equality and mutual assistance.\"\nUnder this commitment, every resident is entitled to health care services.\n\n**Italy**\nUniversal coverage is provided through Italy\u2019s National Health Service (Servizio sanitario nazionale, or SSN), established through legislation in 1978.\nThe SSN automatically covers all citizens and legal foreign residents.\n\n**Japan**\nJapan\u2019s statutory health insurance system (SHIS) covers 98.3 percent of the population, while the separate Public Social Assistance Program, for impoverished people, covers the remaining 1.7 percent.\nCitizens and resident noncitizens are required to enroll in an SHIS plan; undocumented immigrants and visitors are not covered.\n\n**Netherlands**\nIn the Netherlands, a national health insurance program was first rolled out in 1941, reflecting the German Bismarck model of public and private health insurers.\nThe 2006 Health Insurance Act merged the traditional public and private insurance markets into one universal social health insurance program underpinned by private insurance and mandatory coverage.\nAll residents (and nonresidents who pay Dutch income tax) must purchase statutory health insurance from private insurers.\n\n**New Zealand**\nBeginning with the 1938 Social Security Act, a consensus developed in New Zealand that government has a fundamental role in providing for the population\u2019s health care needs.\nNot long after that law\u2019s passage, the government achieved its goal of universal health coverage.\n\n**Norway**\nNorway has universal health and social insurance coverage, known as the National Insurance Scheme (NIS), or Folketrygd.\nIt is currently regulated by the 1997 National Insurance Act and the 1999 Patient Rights Act.\n\n**Singapore**\nSingapore\u2019s health care financing system is underpinned by the belief that all stakeholders share responsibility for attaining sustainable universal health coverage.\nSingapore has a multipayer health care financing framework, where a single treatment episode might be covered by multiple schemes and payers, often overlapping.\n\n**Sweden**\nThe Health and Medical Services Act states that Sweden\u2019s health system must cover all legal residents.\nCoverage is universal and automatic.\n\n**Switzerland**\nHistorically, health insurance in Switzerland had been provided by many small private insurers.\nAfter several attempts to introduce a system of universal coverage, the federal government adopted the Health Insurance Law in 1994, based on a private insurance model.\nSince going into effect in 1996, health insurance coverage is close to 100 percent.\n\n**Taiwan**\nTaiwan's NHI system was implemented in 1995.\nNHI is a government-run social health insurance program that provides equitable medical and health care services to all in case of illness, injury, and childbirth.\nEnrollment in NHI is mandatory for all citizens and for foreigners legally residing in Taiwan for longer than six months.\n\n**United States**\nThe United States does not have universal health insurance coverage.\nIn 1965, the first public insurance programs, Medicare and Medicaid, were enacted through the Social Security Act, and others followed.\n",
